The report highlights that returning expatriates are a prime contributor to spreading the virus

According to a report released by a local volunteer organization, at least 193 people have tested HIV- positive in eight of the country's southern districts.

Among them, 84 (53 men and 31 women) have tested HIV-positive in Khulna district alone, while the other 109 are from the: Jhenidah, Gopalganj, Jashore, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Narail, and Magura districts. This is according to Mukto Akash Bangladesh (MAB) a volunteer organization workingon AIDS-related issues.

When contacted, Khulna Civil Surgeon Dr Abdur Razzak said that they cross-checked the findings released by MAB and corroborated them, reports UNB.

The report also said expatriates returning from foreign countries such as: India, Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and the USA, are the ones responsible for spreading the deadly virus in the districts.

No HIV virus was detected among sex workers of the district.

The number of deaths caused by the virus has been increasing rapidly in the southern districts, the report mentions. The worst-affected areas among the districts are Benapole, Chaugachha, and Khulna town, because the citizens of those areas frequently work in foreign countries, especially India, and carry the lethal virus back.

Sources at Khulna Medical College and Hospital said at least 31 HIV patients underwent treatment at the hospital this year, and three have died.

MAB Coordinator Rehena Begum said the organization is working on raising awareness among the public, regarding the deadly disease—as well as providing nutritional and medical support to HIV patients.","['report', 'hiv', '193', 'spreading', 'organization', 'khulna', 'virus', 'southern', 'hivpositive', 'volunteer', 'districts', 'tested']","Representational photo BigstockThe report highlights that returning expatriates are a prime contributor to spreading the virusAccording to a report released by a local volunteer organization, at least 193 people have tested HIV- positive in eight of the country's southern districts.

World AIDS Day observed: Tuberculosis patients at high risk of HIV,The World Aids Day was observed yesterday across Bangladesh aiming at raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and to honour those who passed from AIDS related complications,"Hedait Hossain Molla, Khulna",2016-12-02 00:00:00,"This year’s slogan for the day is “Let’s raise hands of unity, let’s prevent AIDS.” On the occasion, the STI/AIDS Network of Bangladesh, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and various NGOs brought out a processions from the Shahabag intersection on Thursday morning and paraded different thoroughfares before ending at Osmani Udyan. The reported number of HIV positive cases in the country was 4,143 with estimated number of nearly 9,000, according to the statistics of UNAIDS Bangladesh. According to the Mukta Akash Bangladesh, a non-government organisation, Tuberculosis patients are at high risk of the deadly disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Already three Tuberculosis patients in Khulna have been affected with HIV virus recently. According to the NGO, the numbers of HIV positive people are increasing day by day due to lack of consciousness. In last one year from December 31, 2015 to November 30, 2016, a total of 51 people, including 10 children were infected by HIV/AIDS in Khulna. Abu Mohammad Ali Javed, councilor and administrator of Mukta Akash Bangladesh, told the Dhaka Tribune that three Tuberculosis patients had been infected with HIV/AIDS recently. Terming Tuberculosis virus as nearly same as the HIV, he said: “A total of 37 people were infected with HIV virus in last one year from December 31, 2015 to November 30, 2016 in Khulna. Six of the affected died during the tenure.” Rehana Begum, co-coordinator of Mukta Akash Bangladesh, said: “A total of 69 people in the area are HIV positive and six of them already died. Most the infected are residents of Narail, Jessore, Satkhira and Bagerhat.” Senior Health Officer of Khulna Md Abul Kalam Azad, said: “In 2015 there were 25 HIV positive people in Khulna. In this year, 51 more people were infected with the virus.” Sources of World Vision Bangladesh said about 5.1 millon Indian are infected with HIV. Everyday nearly thousands truck driver entered Bangladesh and most of them are HIV infected. These drivers sometimes engaged in physical relation with Bangladeshi girls without using any protection. Not only this, in last two years, from 2014 to 2016, total 2,234 people in India have been infected by the HIV. Earlier, experts warned that Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country with several well-documented at-risk groups, the most prominent of which is brothel-based sex workers and injecting drug users. Although prevalence rate is remaining low in the country, it is surrounded by nations with much higher prevalence rates and with its own at-risk population. The World AIDS Day is observed on December 1 every year to raise awareness about acute immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV, and to demonstrate international solidarity in the face of the endemic. The day is an opportunity for public and private partners to disseminate information about the status of the pandemic and encourage progress in HIV prevention, treatment and care around the world, particularly in high prevalence countries.Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammad Nasim today said Bangladesh has been successful in controlling HIV and AIDS and it must continue the existing efforts to end these sexually transmitted diseases by 2030. “The government along with local and international organizations would be able to free the country from HIV and AIDS,” he told a discussion in the Osmani Memorial Auditorium here.","['day', 'hiv', 'total', 'bangladesh', 'prevalence', 'virus', 'tuberculosis', 'high', 'patients', 'aids', 'world', 'observed', 'khulna', 'risk', 'infected']","According to the Mukta Akash Bangladesh, a non-government organisation, Tuberculosis patients are at high risk of the deadly disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

"Fight HIV, not sex workers",We need to address the social problems that make sex workers vulnerable to HIV,Md Abdul Quayyum,2016-12-18 00:00:00,"“My father died in a road accident when I was only four years old. I never got a chance at schooling. At six I was sent to Dhaka for domestic work and continued till 13. Then my mother wanted me to get married, but I didn’t want that at the age of 13, so I escaped with a friend. But later I fell into the trap and became a sex worker. Since then I am into this trade, and often I am a victim of physical and sexual assault.” -- A sex worker.

Each year we observe World Aids Day on December 1 along with the globe seeking to lift up awareness to prevent the spread of HIV or AIDS. Though Bangladesh has had a historically lower rate of HIV infection compared to the rest of the world, violence against female sex workers still remains a big threat in terms of HIV and AIDS.

They are one of the key groups most vulnerable to HIV infection in Bangladesh and also in other countries of the world, along with people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, male sex workers, and transgender/hijra.

But sex workers are among those who are most vulnerable to HIV infection, as it spreads rapidly among sex workers. In many cases, sex workers have no access to condoms, or are not aware of their importance. They are simply powerless to negotiate safer sex.

Clients may refuse to pay for sex if they have to use a condom, and use intimidation or violence to force unprotected sex, and in many cases, they are raped. But because of the social stigma and marginalisation, they can’t even bring charges against their attacker.

Criminalisation of sex work contributes to an environment in which violence against sex workers is tolerated, leaving them less likely to be protected from it. Many sex workers consider violence “normal” or “part of the job,” and do not have information about their rights. As a result, these contribute to their vulnerability to HIV.

According to a recent study, the total estimated number of female sex workers in Bangladesh ranges from a minimum of 82,884 to the maximum of 102,260. In Bangladesh, they are mostly vulnerable due to social exclusionary factors such as low income, poverty, debt, unemployment, poor education, etc.

Therefore they are mostly mobile, hidden, and likely to avoid disclosure of their status due to stigma and discrimination. Moreover, more than half (55.8%) of female sex workers interviewed reported to having sex for the first time before the age of 15, and the use of condoms during the last sexual encounter was relatively lower among young sex workers aged as compared to sex workers aged 25 years and above, which put them at a high risk of HIV infection.

The risk of sexual transmission of HIV infection is well-established. An estimated number of 102, 260 female sex workers are engaged in this trade through brothels, hotels, residences, and street-based set-ups.

Violence against sex workers is not only widespread, but is also perpetrated, legitimised, and accepted by many

With their identities, they hardly get any basic services from hospitals and mainstream health providers. In situations where sex workers do not have access to condoms, HIV prevention information, and sexual health services, or are prevented from protecting their health and using condoms for any reason, they are at increased risk of contracting HIV.

The story of the abovementioned sex worker is a real life experience that has reason to make us depressed about humanity. At 13, she was trapped in a cycle of sex work, and when she was 18, she got married to a man who was her pimp, and gave birth to a baby girl in the following year. But her husband didn’t welcome the girl child, and attempted to kill the little one. Luckily, her mother managed to escape with the girl.

“I want to give my daughter education and a good life and I know I need money for that. That’s why I am still in this business and taking life risk to go with the clients in unknown places and do whatever they want me to do. Many times I faced gang rape and sex without condoms. I was heavily injured at times and managed to escape from being murdered.”

Violence against sex workers is not only widespread, but is also perpetrated, legitimised, and accepted by many. It undermines HIV prevention efforts and increases sex workers’ vulnerability to HIV transmission in several ways. We need to get our act together to stop the violence against sex workers and help in preventing HIV.

There is growing recognition that effective HIV prevention policies and programs focusing on sex workers must incorporate violence prevention strategies. Interventions to promote safer sex among sex workers must be part of an overall effort to ensure their safety, promote their health and well-being more broadly, and protect their human rights.

There is also a need to recognise that not all sex workers see themselves as victims, oppressed, or exploited. Instead, many can and are taking control of their own lives, finding solutions to their problems, acting in their individual and collective interests, and contributing to the fight against HIV/ AIDS.

Different international development organisations in Bangladesh, like Save the Children, have been operating 43 drop-in-centres (DICs) for female sex workers since 2008 to give psychological support and essential health services in 26 districts with support from the Global Fund.

There are almost 26,000 female sex workers getting support. But that’s not enough. When responding to the HIV epidemic among sex workers, empowering them and involving them in HIV prevention are necessary.

We also need to address the underlying social and structural problems that make sex workers vulnerable to HIV. By giving them greater legal protection against violence, and by reducing the discrimination they face, HIV prevalence could be cut dramatically.

"Five HIV patients now 'virus, drugs free'","A vaccine-based therapy helped five people with HIV to be “virus, drugs free” – one man has been free of the virus for seven months",Tribune Desk,2017-02-24 00:00:00,"Five people with HIV are currently free of detectable virus – and daily drugs – thanks to a new vaccine-based therapy, reports the New Scientist . This therapy gives the immune system “the tools to flush out HIV, meaning daily drugs can be ditched.” Antiretroviral drugs (ART) are essential for most people with HIV. The drugs are used each day “to stop the virus from replicating and causing damage to their immune system.” These are required to be taken throughout one's lifetime as “the virus can hide away in tissues such as lymphoid and gut cells.” The virus has a tendency to re-emerge from cells – so stopping the use of ART becomes risky for patients. As much as ART is “effective” it is also expensive, takes a long time to work and comes with “nasty side effects.” In 2014, 24 people then recently diagnosed with HIV were given two vaccines developed by Tomas Hanke and his colleagues at the University of Oxford. This was part of a trial that Beatriz Mothe of the IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, and her colleagues started. All the participants were also given ART, then monitored “to see whether the vaccines induced a strong immune response.” A booster of the vaccines was given to all 15 of them this year and, finally, they were given three doses of romidepsin – “a cancer drug that has shown potential for flushing HIV out of hiding.” Eventually, all of them got another vaccine booster and stopped ART doses. The virus rapidly came back in 10 of the participants so they had to go back to ART medication. However, five of the participants “no longer needed to take the drugs because their immune systems could suppress the virus unaided.” “One person has been off ART for seven months now. The other four have been free of detectable virus for six, 14, 19 and 21 weeks, respectively,” writes the New Scientist. Mothe and her colleagues are currently working on to find out why “two-thirds of the group didn’t respond to the therapy.”","['hiv', 'free', 'given', 'colleagues', 'participants', 'virus', 'art', 'patients', 'vaccines', 'immune', 'therapy', 'drugs']","Five people with HIV are currently free of detectable virus – and daily drugs – thanks to a new vaccine-based therapy, reports the New Scientist .

London HIV patient becomes world's second AIDS cure hope,"AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure","Reuters, London",2019-03-05 00:00:00,"AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure

An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV-resistant donor, his doctors said.

Almost three years after he received bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after he came off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the man's previous HIV infection.

""There is no virus there that we can measure. We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure, but does not mean that cure has already been found.

Gupta described his patient as ""functionally cured"" and ""in remission"", but cautioned: ""It's too early to say he's cured.""

The man is being called ""the London patient"", in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV.

Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free.

Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed about 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients.

Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Last chance

In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him.

""This was really his last chance of survival,"" Gupta told Reuters.

The donor - who was unrelated - had a genetic mutation known as 'CCR5 delta 32', which confers resistance to HIV.

The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of ""graft-versus-host"" disease - a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipient's immune cells.

Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people — most of them of northern European descent — who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus.

""Although this is not a viable large-scale strategy for a cure, it does represent a critical moment,"" said Anton Pozniak, president of the International AIDS Society. ""The hope is that this will eventually lead to a safe, cost-effective and easy strategy using gene technology or antibody techniques.""

Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key - or whether the graft-versus-host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said.

His team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. ""We need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,"" he said.

The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details.","['worlds', 'hiv', 'patient', 'experts', 'donor', 'london', 'man', 'second', 'gupta', 'hope', 'aids', 'cure', 'known', 'case']","We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

World AIDS Day: Rohingya influx triggers fears of disease spreading,"'An estimated 12,000 to 14,000 people are living with HIV in Bangladesh, as per the Asian Epidemic Model projection data where our prevalence rate is 0",Tarek Mahmud,2017-12-01 00:00:00,"Although Bangladesh has a lower than average prevalence rate of AIDS cases, the influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar has triggered fears that some of them may bring the deadly disease into the country along with them and cause it to spread. Experts have also expressed concern that a large number of AIDS cases in Bangladesh may be unidentified, artificially lowering the prevalence rate of the disease. A total 83 HIV positive Rohingya have been identified at the refugee camps in the southern part of the country so far, though Unicef HIV/AIDS specialist Dr M Ziya Uddin said Myanmar’s prevalence rate of 0.8% means as many as 5,000 infected Rohingya refugees may have arrived and remain unidentified. He added that two-thirds of all AIDS cases in Bangladesh are similarly in the shadows. “An estimated 12,000 to 14,000 people are living with HIV in Bangladesh, as per the Asian Epidemic Model projection data where our prevalence rate is 0.01%. However, we have only identified 4,721 of them,” Dr Ziya said. In addition, he said 24 children under the age of 10 were among 42 newly identified cases this year. According to data from the National AIDS/STD Programme, 799 people have died from the disease since the first AIDS case was identified in Bangladesh in 1989. Among them, 141 died this year. Sources from the Cox’s Bazar Civil Surgeon Office echoed Dr Ziya in saying that there may be thousands of AIDS affected Rohingya in the refugee camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas, and the disease could spread to the local community if they were not identified soon. Ukhiya Thana Health and Family Planning Officer Dr Mezbah Uddin said: “The Rohingya are not knowledgeable enough on health and disease prevention. They need to be made aware or diseases such as AIDS could easily spread to locals.” However, the health ministry has dismissed fears that AIDS may spread to the general population from Rohingya refugees, saying various measures under the AIDS/STD Programme of the Directorate of Health Services were in place to prevent such an incident. Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammed Nasim said: “Under the programme, various steps have been undertaken to prevent communicable and non-communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS among the Rohingya people staying at different parts of Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas in Cox’s Bazar district.” The measures included provision of free HIV screening and counselling services as well as distribution of kits to diagnose the virus at hospitals in Cox’s Bazar, he added. “In addition, necessary training was given to medical staff and antiretroviral drugs are being given to HIV-infected patients,” the health minister said. Meanwhile, Dr Ziya further said that it was not enough to restrict such programmes to just the Rohingya, and they should be included for the general population as well. “We need a structured programme based on data and evidence, not only for refugees but also for the host community, as the area was always a risk of HIV spreading in the Cox’s Bazar area because there are many immigrant workers in the region, and it is a tourist destination as well,” he said. According to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 250,000 people in Myanmar are affected with AIDS, with the country being one of 35 that account for 90% of new HIV infections in the world. World Aids Day was observed on Thursday, with WHO highlighting the need to include people with HIV in society under the slogan “Everybody counts.”","['day', 'spread', 'influx', 'hiv', 'identified', 'ziya', 'spreading', 'fears', 'dr', 'bangladesh', 'aids', 'world', 'rohingya', 'disease', 'health', 'triggers']","Experts have also expressed concern that a large number of AIDS cases in Bangladesh may be unidentified, artificially lowering the prevalence rate of the disease.
However, we have only identified 4,721 of them,” Dr Ziya said.

HIV-AIDS prevalence survey stopped since 2011,"Last year, a total of 338 new HIV patients were identified in the country, more than 45% of who were migrant workers
        	The internal and external migrant workers have been the biggest threats for spreading HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh as around 50% of the new AIDS patients were identified as migrant workers",Moniruzzaman Uzzal,2013-11-30 00:00:00,"The internal and external migrant workers have been the biggest threats for spreading HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh as around 50% of the new AIDS patients were identified as migrant workers.

Last year, a total of 338 new HIV patients were identified in the country, more than 45% of who were migrant workers.

Though Line Director of National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP), Dr Abdul Wahed, admitted the high prevalence of HIV infection among migrant workers, he refused giving any details.

Meanwhile, the health ministry did not have the actual data concerning this high-risk group as their survey has remained stopped since 2011.

A highly-placed executive at a local NGO, seeking anonymity, told the Dhaka Tribune: “The sero-surveillance report is a must to get a clear picture of prevalence rate among the different high-risk groups. Currently, we are not getting the actual prevalence rate.”

Under this circumstance, Bangladesh like all the other countries in the world will observe the World AIDS Day on Sunday.

The theme for this year’s World AIDS Day is set “Getting to Zero.”

According to health ministry, a total of 2,871 HIV-positive patients have been identified in Bangladesh since 1989, among who 1,204 became AIDS patients and 390 died.

However, there were discrepancies between the public and NGO statistics regarding the numbers.

MM Niazuddin, health secretary, at a press conference at the Secretariat on Saturday said five government hospitals would give patients free medicine and health treatment from January 1 next year.

Arifur Rahman, divisional coordinator of AAS, said they had got 40 new patients, including 17 women and two children, in the current calendar year. All the newly-infected women had received the virus from their expatriate husbands while both children were born infected.

“We are providing medical facilities to 81 females and 17 children.” All the females had received the virus from their husbands while all the children were born infected, he said.

An official at the Hope said they were providing medical assistance to a total of 248 patients. Sixty-nine of their female patients had received the virus from husbands while seven children were born with the virus.

Prof Dr AQM Sirajul Islam, former head of the department of shin and sexual disease at Chittagong Medical College Hospital told the Dhaka Tribune that mostly the wives and children of expatriate workers to the Middle East were facing such fate.

“There are some procedures of conceiving baby for the HIV infected mothers. It is possible to keep the baby safe if the HIV infected parents consult the physicians before conceiving,” said Sirajul, who has long been working with AIDS patients.

Brig Gen Khandakar Shahidul Gani, director at the CMCH, said they had taken up a Unicef-funded project to provide services to the HIV infected parents before and after having a baby.

Ali Hossain, manager of the project, said 90% of the HIV positive children across the country were born infected. However, the ratio was 100% in Chittagong. “It is possible to bring the percentage down to only two through providing services to the infected parents,” he said.

It has been learnt that the NGOs have not yet agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding with the government. It requires them to deposit 10-20% of the total funding as performance security.

Habiba Akter, executive director of Ashar Alo, said it would not be possible to deposit a large amount of money which may hamper the treatment.","['hivaids', 'hiv', 'total', 'survey', 'children', 'migrant', 'prevalence', 'patients', 'aids', 'born', 'world', 'health', '2011', 'infected', 'stopped']","The internal and external migrant workers have been the biggest threats for spreading HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh as around 50% of the new AIDS patients were identified as migrant workers.

Surprising monkey study could lead to ‘functional’ HIV cure,"Dr Anthony Fauci doesn't get too excited about the results of animal studies, and he doesn't make house calls",Reuters,2016-12-03 00:00:00,"But when a drug already taken by thousands of people for intestinal conditions appeared to control the monkey version of HIV, it got the attention of the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci hopped on a plane to Cambridge, Mass., to personally tell Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's US representatives that their drug may offer a dramatic advance in the fight against AIDS. Takeda’s drug suppressed the virus to undetectable levels in eight monkeys, some for two years. The findings raise hopes for a so-called ""functional cure"" – a treatment that puts the disease in sustained remission. ""The data was so dramatic,"" said Fauci, who has made AIDS research his life’s work. The drug is one of several promising ideas heading into early-stage human trials, all seeking to help patients control the virus that causes AIDS for extended periods without daily antiretroviral therapy (ART). The studies build on research propelled by the case of Timothy Ray Brown, the so-called ""Berlin patient,"" whose HIV was eradicated through an elaborate stem cell transplant in 2007. ""There has been this explosion of discovery,"" said Mitchell Warren, executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. ""There are completely new ideas that were impossible to conceive even a few years ago.""HIV once meant certain death. But, for more than half of the 36.7 million HIV patients around the world, ART transformed it into a chronic disease. Taken daily, ART suppresses the virus. But keeping up a daily medication regimen is difficult. The drugs are expensive and toxic, causing nausea, fatigue and nerve problems in the short-term, and insulin resistance and other problems over time. Only about a third of US patients take ART consistently enough to push the virus down to undetectable levels. “We're going to need other approaches,"" said Dr Nelson Michael, director of the US Military HIV Research Program at the Walter Reed Army Institute. Much work has focused on the discovery of rare antibodies made by HIV patients that can neutralize several different forms of the virus. One trial involving an antibody called PGT121 licensed by Gilead Sciences Inc reduced the virus to undetectable levels in 16 of 18 monkeys; the effect lasted for four months in three of them. At Walter Reed, Michael is taking a different tack, testing whether a vaccine - being developed to prevent HIV infection - can fight off the virus in infected individuals. Last month, Michael and researchers at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center published the results of a monkey test of Johnson & Johnson's HIV vaccine candidate called Ad26/MVA and Gilead's experimental drug GS-986. On its own, the vaccine had a modest effect. But it was even more effective when it was given with GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that “kicks the immune system up to a higher gear,” Michael said. All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for at least six months. Human trials could begin within months, said Dr Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer. ""If the cure is there, the industry will find a way to get there very quickly,"" Stoffels said.Fauci’s visit was a first for Takeda, a company focused on treatments for cancer, gastroenterology and the central nervous system, said Dr Michael Shetzline, who heads clinical science for Takeda in Cambridge. “The excitement was just clear,” Shetzline said. “It was like, 'Wow.'"" Takeda does not study HIV. But its researchers understood the basic science surrounding its drug Entyvio, an antibody engineered to attack a specific protein. The drug, known generically as vedolizumab, is approved in more than 50 countries for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which occur when the immune system attacks the intestines. ""Entyvio is a cell trafficking molecule that affects immune responses,"" Shetzline said. ""In this instance, the GI tract is what is harbouring this HIV cell population that needs to be cleared - at least that is what the monkey study implies."" Takeda is providing the drug and supporting the study. Shetzline cautioned that it's only a pilot. ""We'd love to see this benefit patients,” he said. If it pans out, cost could be an issue. Entyvio is priced as a biologic, similar to other IBD treatments, which range from $2,000 to $5,000 a month, according to Consumer Reports. Entyvio's HIV trial began in August and seeks to enrol 15 to 25 people with stable disease. They will remain on daily ART drugs while taking nine infusions of Entyvio over a period of several months. Then, ART will be stopped, they will get two more infusions, and doctors will watch to see if the virus rebounds – or remains suppressed. Manni Baez, 30, of Columbus, Ohio, travels to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, about once a month for the study. “For me, the end game is providing the folks at NIH with the resources they need to get them closer to finding a cure or a vaccine for this plague,"" Baez said. Fauci said he doesn’t expect meaningful results until late 2017 or early 2018. Even partial success would be huge, he said. ""If we discontinue therapy in the 15, and four of them don't rebound,” he said, then “that is the best anybody has ever seen.” Fauci said he doesn’t get emotional about the data he collects, and, in any event, it’s early days for this research. “I try to be as objective as I possibly can,” he said. “I will get really excited if we get our first seven people in human (trial), and I stop ART - and they don't rebound.”","['lead', 'hiv', 'study', 'functional', 'shetzline', 'vaccine', 'drug', 'michael', 'virus', 'art', 'patients', 'cure', 'takeda', 'surprising', 'monkey']","The findings raise hopes for a so-called ""functional cure"" – a treatment that puts the disease in sustained remission.

"Mobile app tests blood for HIV, syphilis","Professor Sia's team's work is published in Science Tranlational MedicineA new smartphone app that tests blood samples for HIV and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world, scientists claim",Dailymail,2015-02-05 00:00:00,"A new smartphone app that tests blood samples for HIV and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world, scientists claim.

The software, developed by biomedical experts at Columbia University, analyses blood samples taken with a finger-prick dongle.

The kit, which attaches to any smartphone or computer, replicates a lab test and can give a diagnosis in the field in just 15 minutes.

The device is nearly 540 times cheaper than current lab testing machines, and has already been tested on patients in Rwanda during a pilot study.

Health workers tested the blood of 96 patients who were enrolling into clinics aimed at preventing transmission of HIV from mother to child, or those visiting voluntary counselling and testing centres.

The dongle was developed to be small and light enough to fit in one hand.

It draws its power from the smartphone allowing it to be used in remote areas, providing the phone is charged.

Samuel Sia, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia University, said the team's work showed that full laboratory-quality tests can be run on a smartphone app.

This makes a diagnosis accessible to almost any population with access to smartphones.

'This kind of capability can transform how health care services are delivered around the world,' he added.

In the past, Professor Sia's team has worked on creating miniature testing kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases.

He said: 'We know that early diagnosis and treatment in pregnant mothers can greatly reduce adverse consequences to both them and their babies.'

The new kits are expected to cost around £22.50 to manufacture, compared with the £12,150 cost of a standard lab testing machine.

In Rwanda, healthcare workers were given 30 minutes of training and 97% of patients said they would recommend the device.

This was because of its fast turnaround time, ability to offer results for multiple diseases and the simplicity of procedure.

Professor Sia said: “Our dongle presents new capabilities for a broad range of users, from health care providers to consumers.

“By increasing detection of syphilis infections, we might be able to reduce deaths by 10-fold.

'And for large-scale screening - where the dongle's high sensitivity with few false negatives is critical - we might be able to scale up HIV testing at the community level with immediate antiretroviral therapy.

“This could nearly stop HIV transmissions and approach elimination of this devastating disease.

“We are really excited about the next steps in bringing this product to the market in developing countries.

“And we are equally excited about exploring how this technology can benefit patients and consumers back home.”

Chinese hospital infects five patients with HIV,A Chinese hospital has admitted to accidentally infecting five people with HIV because a staff member reused medical equipment that should have been discarded,BBC BBC,2017-02-10 00:00:00,"Blood-selling

Officials said that a technician reused a tube used to treat an individual with HIV on other patients. Provincial authorities described it as a ""severe violation of procedure"". Five people had been sacked at Hangzhou's Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, they said. Provincial health officials said they were informed of the situation on 26 January. But in a statement (in Chinese) they gave no information on how many other patients might have been exposed, what they were being treated for or when the infections occurred. Those affected would receive treatment and compensation, the brief statement said. Low safety standards and insufficient regulation helped spread HIV/Aids in China two decades ago, and the news of the hospital incident sparked shock and criticism from social media users. ""If a provincial-level hospital doesn't follow protocols, who can we trust as average citizens?"" wrote one person on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. ""This case is exposed, but what about cases that we don't know? There must have been many more!"" wrote another.Cases of HIV/Aids rose sharply in China after a major scandal in Henan province in the 1990s, when farmers who sold their blood contracted HIV through poor safety practices. The blood collected from donors' was pooled together and the lucrative plasma removed. The remaining blood, now cross-contaminated, was then injected back into the donors so they could donate again soon. For years, officials tried to cover up the problem and it is still not clear how many were infected. China said in 2001 that between 30,000 and 50,000 people had contracted HIV through the blood-selling scandal, but other officials have since suggested the figure was much higher. The scandal did help highlight the ways in which HIV could be passed, and rules surrounding blood donation and transfusions have since improved, but illegal practises remain. In 2006, a group of 19 people sued a hospital in Heilongjiang over transfusions from which they contracted HIV. In a recent report, China said it had 501,000 reported cases of HIV/Aids by the end of 2014. It gave no estimate of unreported cases.","['hiv', 'hivaids', 'officials', 'chinese', 'provincial', 'china', 'blood', 'infects', 'patients', 'cases', 'contracted', 'scandal', 'hospital']","Blood-sellingOfficials said that a technician reused a tube used to treat an individual with HIV on other patients.

Sanofi tests three-in-one antibody to treat or prevent HIV,Other experiments showed the novel antibodies were active against 99% of more than 200 diverse strains of HIV tested,Reuters,2017-09-22 00:00:00,"A three-pronged man-made antibody, created by French drugmaker Sanofi and US scientists, could offer a new way to treat or prevent HIV, following successful tests in monkeys. Other experiments showed the novel antibodies were active against 99% of more than 200 diverse strains of HIV tested. The results were published in the journal Science on Wednesday.t Plans are under way to try the so-called trispecific antibody in initial human trials before the end of 2018, potentially adding a new weapon in the fight against AIDS, assuming the product proves safe and effective. If all goes well, the three-in-one antibody could be used either as a long-acting treatment or a vaccine, according to Sanofi Chief Scientific Officer Gary Nabel. “There is certainly urgency for a vaccine and this could help fill that void,” he said in an interview. “But we need to do the clinical studies and let nature tell us what works.” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose experts collaborated on the project, described the new approach as “intriguing”. Unlike naturally occurring antibodies, the laboratory-made ones hit multiple biological targets in a single product - a feature that is particularly valuable in fighting HIV, given the huge genetic diversity of viruses around the world. After exposing 24 monkeys to two strains of a monkey form of HIV, researchers found the majority of those given a traditional antibody developed infection compared with none of those receiving the trispecific one. The ability of trispecific antibodies to hit three targets at once might also make them useful in fighting cancer, other infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. A number of drug companies are already working with bispecific antibodies but a three-pronged approach takes things to the next level. “This is the beginning of a technology platform that we could adapt to other diseases, so we will look carefully at that,” Nabel said.","['hiv', 'strains', 'treat', 'antibody', 'targets', 'tests', 'antibodies', 'way', 'threepronged', 'trispecific', 'vaccine', 'threeinone', 'diseases', 'prevent', 'sanofi']","A three-pronged man-made antibody, created by French drugmaker Sanofi and US scientists, could offer a new way to treat or prevent HIV, following successful tests in monkeys.

"‘I am HIV positive, please accept me’",'I did not know anything about HIV at the time,Abid Azad,2014-11-30 00:00:00,"Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Bangladeshi HIV positive baby, who has now grown into adulthood, dreams of the day she can show her face and say her name in dignity.

“I am HIV positive. Please accept me,” an 18 year-old teenage girl from Chittagong said to this reporter.

She shared her story and her hopes with the Dhaka Tribune on Saturday morning, two days ahead of World AIDS Day.

Alo – not her real name – passed her Higher Secondary Certificate exam this year from the Arts group and is now waiting to start her tertiary level education.

She was infected with HIV in the womb. Her father, who infected her mother, died from AIDS in 2002 when she was 6.

As far as she can remember, her father died from a severe sickness. No one then knew that he had AIDS.

“We learned that my father was HIV positive when my mother fell severely ill the year after he died. We took my mother to many hospitals. Later we found out that she had AIDS too,” Alo said.

In 2003, Alo lost her mother and she, together with her two elder sisters, were asked to be tested for HIV.

The test revealed that Alo was HIV positive but her two sisters were not. Since then, Alo has been taking anti-retroviral medicines twice a day, everyday.

“I did not know anything about HIV at the time. But I can remember that my bitter life started with that test result.

“Even my two sisters did not keep me with them on the bed. They placed me on the floor while they slept on the bed,” Alo recalled as tears filled her eyes.

“I can still remember that my utensils, clothes and other personal belongings were a different colour so as to be easily recognisable,” she said.

“Everyone told me to stay away because I had a disease that could kill them.

“I cried by myself. I have learnt how to cry alone and how to remain alone,” she said, her voice growing heavy.

Her family told her she had a disease that could kill them, without a care for the fact that the disease could kill her.

After slow exposure to the facts about HIV/AIDS, her sisters and relatives came to understand that it is not a contagious disease in the typical sense. They now understand how it is transmitted.

Alo herself says she now understands that she need not bear any stigma for her HIV positive status.

Alo has hidden her HIV status all of these years. Her sisters, all that survives of her nuclear family, and a handful of relatives know her condition.

To the rest of the world, this part of her is invisible, she says, because of intolerance.

She knows she would not be accepted by society, her school or her peers if they knew the truth.

Her neighbours, relatives, friends and teachers do not know about her HIV status.

I could never tell anyone about my disease because no one would understand me. They would misjudge me. Our society is not friendly towards us, she said.

“I do not become too close to my sister’s child. I never kiss the child although I love the child very much and the child likes me as well,” she said.

When asked why she doesn’t express her affection for the child, Alo replied: “Yes, I know it will not harm the child but I do not want to take a chance. I do not want to be the reason for anyone getting sick.”

“I treat the child as my own,” she said.

Alo shared her one great hope with the Dhaka Tribune and prays to God that her wish comes true.

She wants a job of her own and a worthy husband who is also HIV positive.

“It is very tough to remain unmarried. I want a husband who is also living with HIV. Only he will be able to understand me.”

Alo hopes one day she can reveal her identity, when there will be no social stigma or discrimination.

“I want to come out of my dark and lonely world.”","['positive', 'understand', 'hiv', 'know', 'alo', 'child', 'sisters', 'disease', 'mother', 'world', 'accept']","Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Bangladeshi HIV positive baby, who has now grown into adulthood, dreams of the day she can show her face and say her name in dignity.

UN: Mobile dating apps spur HIV epidemic among Asia’s teenagers,"United Nations research has found the growing use of mobile dating apps by young gay men is a major factor in a new HIV epidemic among teenagers in Asia, the Guardian can reveal",theguardian.com,2015-11-30 00:00:00,"United Nations research has found the growing use of mobile dating apps by young gay men is a major factor in a new HIV epidemic among teenagers in Asia, the Guardian can reveal.

The report uncovered a surge of HIV infections among 10-19 years olds in the Asia-Pacific region, where more than half of the world’s 1.2 billion adolescents live.

The two-year study found that smartphone dating apps have expanded the options for spontaneous casual sex as never before.

The epidemic is fastest growing amongst men who have sex with men. Other groups include those who are sexually exploited by or engaged in sex work, people who inject drugs, and young transgender people.

“Young gay men themselves have consistently told us that they are now using mobile dating apps to meet up for sex, and are having more casual sex with more people as a result. We know that this kind of risky behaviour increases the spread of HIV,” said Wing-Sie Cheng, HIV/Aids adviser for Unicef in east Asia and the Pacific.

“We are therefore convinced that there is a link, and that we need to work better with mobile app providers to share information about HIV and protect the health of adolescents.”

The previously unreported epidemic threatens the UN’s goal to end the global Aids crisis by 2030, which appeared achievable after a sharp drop in Africa during the past 15 years.

Adolescents are also more likely to die of Aids-related deaths, researchers from Unicef and UNAIDS found, as they are less inclined to seek treatment, fearing they will be stigmatised or forced to expose their sexuality to their family or the authorities. In many countries in the region, under-18s cannot get an HIV test without parental consent.

While global HIV infections are falling, the number of adolescents aged 10-19 officially living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific has grown to more than 220,000, with the unofficial number expected to be much higher, Unicef says. Fewer than half of them are receiving treatment and deaths have risen nearly every year for a decade.

An HIV-positive Filipino man aged 30, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect himself from abuse, said it was hard to find sex for a gay teenager, bullied at school and closed off from the adult-only gay bars.

At university, the introduction of internet dating — chat rooms and online forums — allowed him to find more sexual partners his age. He would chat with men and agree to rent a room for a few hours in the capital.

“If I write down all the people I had sex with in Manila, I can probably write one to five people for each stop of the metro,” he said.

Smartphones and mobile dating revolutionised his sex life. Whereas internet dating involved a laborious process of arranging a meeting up, dating apps are location-based, allowing users to scan their surroundings for others.

“Even if you’re still in school and you feel the need to have sex, you just open Grindr,” he said. “You don’t even have to talk to them. People just send you naked photos or photos of their cocks. If you’re fine with them, you just go and have sex.”

The immediacy of the sex, organised in minutes, made condom use less likely, he said. “I did use condoms. But it was not consistent. You don’t want to lose the momentum.”

Despite his promiscuous mobile dating years, the Filipino man’s HIV test returned negative and he entered into a long-term relationship. But two years later he contracted the virus from his boyfriend who was secretly cheating on him by using mobile dating apps.

In the Philippines, new HIV infections among teenagers have doubled in four years. In Bangkok, young gay men now have a one in three chance of HIV infection.

And eighteen countries across the Asia-Pacific region criminalise against same-sex relationships — which UNAIDS says causes gay men to avoid life-saving HIV services.

A separate study last year found that men who have sex with men using dating apps are at greater risk of contracting gonorrhoea and chlamydia than those who meet in-person or on the internet.

Wing-Sie, the Unicef adviser, said that dating apps create networks of men, in which infections rapidly spread among users. “Mobile dating apps essentially hook you up to a central network.”

She said the study looked at observational trends around the region reported by United Nations officers and local community workers who said their HIV strategy urgently needed to adapt to the explosion of mobile dating apps. “HIV is a covert issue, it is very hidden. So data is not available.”

She said researchers found “that with the rise of these apps, the probability and risk of infection will increase multifold because it makes it so much easier for them to date other guys and hook up for sex,” she said.

A spokesman from Grindr, used in 196 countries worldwide with 1 million active users every minute, said it has a minimum age requirement of 18. “As the world’s largest gay platform, we take matters of sexual health very seriously,” the spokesman said, adding that Grindr runs in-app announcements encouraging testing at local clinics.

David S Novak, senior health strategist at Online Buddies, the parent company of the dating app Jack’d, directed the Guardian to its ManHunt Cares project, which provides health resources to its users. In 2009, the company also set up a research institute focusing on gay sexual health.

Other major dating app companies Tinder, Blued and Growlr did not respond to requests for comment.

The UN report says these apps can become vital conduits promoting sexual health, including HIV messaging and testing, and references a 2014 World Aids Day project by the Chinese gay dating app Blued where a red ribbon was added next to every user’s profile picture, linking to details of nearby testing centres.

Wing-Sie said Unicef will approach mobile dating app companies in the coming months for a “collaborative effort” and so the world body might collect data to further investigate the impact of mobile dating.

Based in Bangkok, Jesse Krisintu has been working with charities trying to persuade young people to get tested for HIV through tactics such as pop-up advertisements on dating apps. He said the project did not work.

“It’s their business. If they advertise too much about HIV/Aids services there, do you think people are going to go online?” he said.

He said that one project involving pop-ups offered discounts on HIV tests but that very few were claimed and that the analytics shows most users immediately closed the pop-up advert.

“The application is where the key population is but no one is going to read the pop-up because the purpose of people going to those apps to find sex, not to find knowledge. The results are not that favourable,” he said. “People just close it.”

The UN is now also advocating for comprehensive sex education — beyond a simple explanation of the sex organs — and for reducing the age at which adolescents can take an HIV test without parental consent.

AIDS is already the leading cause of death for adolescents in Africa and the second leading cause of death among adolescents globally, tripling over the past 15 years and mostly as a result of mother-to-child transmission. However, this new breed of epidemic found in Asia-Pacific could be replicated elsewhere, public health officials warn.

“There is a risk of not being able to eliminate Aids at all,” Wing-Sie said. “This is the new frontier of Aids to tackle right now. The world can never end Aids if this issue is not controlled.”","['teenagers', 'mobile', 'hiv', 'epidemic', 'spur', 'dating', 'apps', 'sex', 'asias', 'users', 'health', 'gay', 'unicef', 'men']","United Nations research has found the growing use of mobile dating apps by young gay men is a major factor in a new HIV epidemic among teenagers in Asia, the Guardian can reveal.

Health ministry to provide free AIDS treatment,"Five public hospitals to be brought under the scheme initially from January, other to follow suit
        	The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is going to introduce a free health service for HIV/AIDS patients in the public hospitals starting on January 1, 2014",Moniruzzaman Uzzal,2013-11-28 00:00:00,"The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is going to introduce a free health service for HIV/AIDS patients in the public hospitals starting on January 1, 2014. Five medical college-hospitals in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet and Rajshahi would be brought under the scheme primarily with the others to follow suit, officials said.

The ministry may sign an agreement with three NGOs any day soon, which will be responsible for monitoring and supervising the service. The organisations are Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash and CAAP (Confidential Approach to Aids Prevention).

However, several top officials of the NGOs said the initiative may not have likely effects because of the ministry’s lack of preparation in this regard.

For one, they argued, the doctors, nurses and supporting staff of the hospitals should be given special training before introducing the service, so that they can provide proper health care to people living with HIV (PLWHIV). For another, lack of adequate machinery and equipment.

It has been learnt that the ministry had bought eight modern “CD-4 Cell Machines” – necessary for HIV positive patients – for different public hospitals about four years ago, but only four of them have remained functional because of the scarcity of reagents.

But MM Niazuddin, secretary of MOHFW, is hopeful they can ensure quality health service for the HIV patients.

“They are many challenges to overcome, the most important one being the social stigma attached to those contacting HV. They continue to face discrimination even though 24 years had lapsed since the first HIV positive case was detected in the country. But we are hopeful we can ensure quality service for them,” he said.

He was speaking at a press conference at the Secretariat on the eve of the World AIDS Day-2013, which will be observed on December 1 with the theme “Getting to Zero”. However, the newly appointed Health Minister Rowshan Ershad was conspicuously absent from the conference although she was scheduled to be there.

In his address, the health secretary said, “HIV/AIDS is just a disease and anyone suffering from a disease should not be seen as a criminal or pitied upon. They deserve to live like any normal citizens.” He stressed the need for increased awareness of the disease and removing disparity based on diseases.

Highlighting the overall scenario of the disease, he said HIV prevalence in the country was still low. Only 2,871 HIV-positive patients have been found in Bangladesh since 1989 when the first case of its kind was detected. Amongst them, 1,204 become AIDS patients and 390 of them died.

He also said Bangladesh had been selected as the organising country of the International Congress on Aids in Asia and the Specific (ICAAP), scheduled to be held in 2015. The latest data on HIV will be announced on the AIDS Day.","['free', 'hiv', 'ministry', 'hospitals', 'secretary', 'provide', 'country', 'patients', 'aids', 'disease', 'health', 'treatment', 'service']","The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is going to introduce a free health service for HIV/AIDS patients in the public hospitals starting on January 1, 2014.

Foreign donors to stop funding for AIDS patients in Bangladesh,"The HIV patients will face serious crisis when the Global Fund to Fight AIDSA precarious time lies ahead for the country’s HIV-positive and AIDS patients as international donors organisation providing preventive measures for HIV infection, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for HIV-positive and AIDS patients, are pulling out their operations in Bangladesh",Abid Azad,2014-11-30 00:00:00,"A precarious time lies ahead for the country’s HIV-positive and AIDS patients as international donors organisation providing preventive measures for HIV infection, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for HIV-positive and AIDS patients, are pulling out their operations in Bangladesh.

Agencies like USAID and Save the Children have already stopped their operations concerning HIV/AIDS patients, including medical treatment, since the government announced in 2009 that it would provide all necessary treatment to HIV patients from 2012, to be funded by the World Bank. However, it has yet to put such mechanism in place in the country.

The HIV patients will face serious crisis when the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria stops their project at the end of this year, followed by the Swiss Red Cross which will end their project next year.

Since starting their operation in Bangladesh in 2004, the Global Fund has invested around $131m in Bangladesh to continue HIV prevention and AIDS control efforts. The Swiss Red Cross started their activities in 2000.

Three local NGOs – Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash Bangladesh and Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP) – are also currently working for the HIV patients and provide them with free medicine and other necessary treatment. They are funded by the aforementioned donor agencies and will struggle to provide their services when the donors stop their funding here.

As the government has no proper institutional support for these patients, they will have nowhere to go for the free medical treatment, counselling, physical and mental health support and other services once the NGOs shut down. The Dhaka Tribune talked to UNAIDS Country Director Leo Kenny, who said: “Bangladesh treats all people who need Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) free of charge. But we are facing a situation where the government has agreed to take over procurement and distribution of ART treatment from the Global Fund. We are facing procurement delays and this needs to be sorted out immediately.”

Delay in government initiative

Despite the announcement in 2009, it was in 2013 when the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP) started working on a project titled “Comprehensive care, support and treatment of PLHIV (people who are living with HIV)” to provide treatment and other services in collaboration with NGOs directly involved with this particular field.

The plan was approved by The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in August last year and by World Bank in October. But the NASP later informed the government that the plan needed to be revised.

“We found that it was not possible to implement the plan with direct collaboration with the NGOs and it required revision,” NASP Line Director Dr Husain Sarwar Khan told the Dhaka Tribune. “It has been delayed due to the whole process of reviewing the plan and other formalities. We hope that the government will implement the plan very soon.”

Gaps and challenges

According to government statistics, 3,241 people have been diagnosed with HIV infection in the country between 1989 and 2013, 1,299 of whom contracted AIDS and 472 died from it. 370 new HIV-positive patients were identified in the country last year.

UNAIDS data says that the estimated new infections have increased by 25% in Bangladesh since 2001 and the reported new infections has increased 1.5 times over the past five years.

The number has been especially increasing in some key population, such as sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgenders, etc.

There are more than 9,000 people in the country living with HIV, two-thirds of whom did not know their status, according to an estimate by the UNAIDS last year. The most updated scenario will be announced today, on the occasion of the World AIDS Day.

There have been many challenges regarding the detection and treatment of HIV patients, despite their low number compared to the country’s total population. Talking to the Dhaka Tribune, several HIV/AIDS patients said they preferred going to the NGOs where they can get proper treatment by keeping their identity secret, as well as proper counselling.

In addition patients and NGO officials alike claimed that the government had not created a friendly environment for HIV/AIDS patients in government and private hospitals, and the patients have to suffer fear, social stigma and discrimination.

Leo Kenny said: “The main reason people do not access testing is stigma and discrimination, so we need to address this. Repealing the punitive laws and policies will be a big step in the right direction.

“There are important capacities which need to be built especially at a district and upazila level. Bangladesh has good guidelines and algorithms for prevention, treatment care and support, but for them to be fully implemented major capacity building needs to ensue.”

Amitabh Sharma, the newly-appointed country representative of Swiss Red Cross in Bangladesh, said the main challenge is the lack of institutional support and a strong institutional structure from the government.

“It is high time that the government should take the leading position. We do not lead; we can only provide support. We, the donors, can never be the substitute to the government,” he told the Dhaka Tribune.

Habiba Akhter, executive director at Ashar Alo Society, said: “The government should bring all vulnerable people under the HIV identification process, otherwise there is no guarantee to prevent further infection.

“We only find HIV patients when they become weak and are continuously suffering from diseases and infections. To bring these people under the identification process, a fair and supportive environment should be ensured at all levels of society.

“The sooner people come to test for HIV infection, the sooner they can get treated in case of infection,” she told the Dhaka Tribune.","['stop', 'hiv', 'donors', 'dhaka', 'bangladesh', 'provide', 'ngos', 'patients', 'aids', 'funding', 'plan', 'support', 'treatment', 'foreign']","A precarious time lies ahead for the country’s HIV-positive and AIDS patients as international donors organisation providing preventive measures for HIV infection, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for HIV-positive and AIDS patients, are pulling out their operations in Bangladesh.

Unicef: 80 adolescents to die of AIDS globally a day by 2030,United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on Thursday,UNB,2018-12-01 00:00:00,"United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on Thursday

Today is World Aids Day.

In Bangladesh, HIV prevalence among the general population remains low (<0.1%) while around 80 adolescents will die of AIDS globally every day by 2030 as per current trends.

United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on Thursday.

Some 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030, according to the new Unicef report.

This means, the report said, 76 adolescent deaths every day, without additional investment in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) prevention, testing, and treatment programs.

In 2017, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) reported that among the 865 new reported cases, more than 5% affected were children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, and 25% were women.

Unicef Bangladesh and National HIV Program of the government are working on sustainability and scaling up of services for the prevention of mother to child transmission, HIV prevention, treatment, and care for most at risk adolescents, and the protection, care, and treatment of children affected by AIDS.

The report, “Children, HIV and AIDS: The World in 2030,” noted that based on population projections, and at current trends, the number of 19 year-olds newly-infected with HIV will reach an estimated 270,000 in 2030, decreasing by one third over current estimates.

It showed that the number of children and adolescents dying from AIDS related causes will decline, from a current 119,000 to 56,000 in 2030.

However, this downward trajectory is too slow, particularly among adolescents.

According to the report, by 2030, the number of new HIV infections among children in the first decade of life will be cut in half, while new infections among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years old will only decrease by 29%.

AIDS related deaths are projected to decrease by 57% among children below the age of 14, compared with a 35% decrease among those aged 15 to 19 years.

Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore said: “The report makes it clear, without the shadow of a doubt, that the world is off track when it comes to ending AIDS among children and adolescents by 2030.

“Programs to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to babies are paying off but haven’t gone far enough, while programs to treat the virus and prevent it from spreading among older children are nowhere near where they should be.”

Unicef estimates that nearly 700 adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 are newly infected with HIV every day, or one every two minutes.

The report also noted that an estimated 1.9 million children and adolescents will still be living with HIV in 2030, mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa (1.1 million), followed by West and Central Africa (571,000), and Latin America and the Caribbean (84,000).

Currently, 3 million children and adolescents are living with HIV around the world, more than half of them in Eastern and Southern Africa.

Reductions in the number of 0-19 year-olds living with HIV between 2018 and 2030 will also vary by region, with the greatest decline in South Asia (close to 50%) and Eastern and Southern Africa (40%).

By contrast, that number will only decline by 24% in Central and Western Africa, the region with the second highest burden.

Many children and adolescents do not know whether they have HIV or not, and among those who have been found HIV-positive and put on treatment, very few adhere to that treatment.

To address these persistent gaps, the report recommends a number of approaches supported by Unicef, including: family-centred testing to help identify and treat children living with HIV but not yet diagnosed; more diagnostic technologies at the point of care to improve early infant diagnosis; greater use of digital platforms to improve HIV knowledge among adolescents; adolescent-friendly services; and targeted community outreach for adolescents.

“We can’t win the fight against HIV if we don’t accelerate progress in preventing transmission to the next generation,” said Fore.

Fore further said: “We must maintain the sense of urgency to sustain gains made in the past decade for both boys and girls. And to do this we must look to innovative and preventative ways of reaching the most vulnerable and at-risk young people.”","['day', 'report', 'hiv', 'children', 'globally', 'die', '2030', '19', 'aids', 'world', '80', 'unicef', 'adolescents', 'number']","United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on ThursdayToday is World Aids Day.

Researchers found that in contrast to global trends, deaths from HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh increased by a rate of 1.9% (compared to 1.5% globally) between 2000 and 2013. On the other hand, deaths from TB and malaria have fallen at a faster rate than the global average at 6.7% (compared to 3.7% globally) and 11.1% (compared to 3.1% globally), respectively, between 2000 and 2013.

The study also showed that from 2000 to 2013, Bangladesh had a large decline in malaria deaths, dropping from 114 in 2000 to 32 in 2013.

In a press release issued on Wednesday, the ICDDRB said The Lancet report showed that worldwide, HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria killed fewer people than in the past, with declines in new cases and deaths accelerating since 2000.

The study further revealed that there were a total of 204 tuberculosis (TB) cases per 100,000 people in Bangladesh in 2013, and 193 new cases of TB per 100,000 were diagnosed that year. In comparison, there were seven cases of HIV/AIDS per 100,000 in Bangladesh in 2013, and less than one new infection per 100,000 for that year.

Published on July 22, the study titled “Global, regional and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2013” was conducted by an international consortium of researchers led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

Dr Aliya Naheed, a co-author of the study and also an associate scientist at the ICDDRB, said: “Bangladesh has worked hard to improve the diagnosis and treatment of TB. We have also invested in malaria control efforts, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria provided important support for our national malaria program since 2007.

Foreign Minister Dipu Moni handed over a formal letter from the Saarc Secretary-General to Runa Laila yesterday during a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital, UNB reported.

Runa Laila was nominated as one of the three Saarc Goodwill Ambassadors for HIV/AIDS at a meeting of the selection committee held at the Saarc Secretariat, Kathmandu early this year.

The two other Saarc Goodwill Ambassadors are Bollywood star Ajay Devgan and Pakistani journalist and documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.

The committee considered 10 nominations from the Saarc member states based on the individuals’ regional stature and eminence, appeal to the target audience, relevance in delivery of message, likely commitment and innovative ways that could be utilised in promoting advocacy and awareness in combating HIV/AIDS.

While expressing her reaction to media, Runa Laila said: “I surely feel happy. It’s a matter of honour for me. My work has just started from today.”

Runa Laila said her key work would be to create awareness among people about HIV/AIDS. “In our region, the perception and idea is low about the HIV/AIDS.”

She said she did not communicate with the other two ambassadors. “I hope I will work together with them.”

The Saarc Goodwill Ambassador programme was conceived in 2008 with an aim to engage regionally well-known personalities to create greater awareness about HIV/AIDS in South Asia and to facilitate the implementation of Saarc regional strategy and its work plan on HIV/AIDS.

The Goodwill Ambassadors under the programme undertake visits to the Saarc countries to raise awareness and advocate greater support to the fight against AIDS.

Their interactions with children and people affected by HIV and AIDS help remove the social stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS.

US programme set to mark birth of one millionth HIV-free baby,"<br />
        	Pepfar initially committed $15bn over five years, aimed specifically to provide anti-retroviral drugs to HIV infected people<br />
        
        	This month somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the one millionth baby will be born without HIV to a mother who suffers from the disease, thanks in large part to a decade-old US aid programme",AFP,2013-06-18 00:00:00,"This month somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the one millionth baby will be born without HIV to a mother who suffers from the disease, thanks in large part to a decade-old US aid programme.

It is yet another remarkable step in the long fight against HIV and Aids, as the United States and its global partners work towards what they call an Aids-free generation.

Effective anti-retroviral drugs and regimens are now dramatically cutting the chances of an infected mother passing on the disease to her baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

The millionth baby born HIV-free was Tuesday to be trumpeted as part of celebrations to mark the 10th anniversary of the US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar).

The biggest fall in transmission rates from mom to infant has come since 2009, US Global Aids coordinator Eric Goosby told AFP.

“Somewhere round 430,000 babies are born annually with HIV and this project that we’ve been in really since the beginning of Pepfar and has intensified over the last three years in partnership with UNAid and Unicef,” Goosby said.

The programme was working to “virtually eliminate paediatric HIV by 2015 and keep their mothers alive,” he said, with aim of reducing the number of babies born with the infection to around 30,000 annually.

This is “a significant flag for Pepfar” which works in 36 countries, he added, pointing to all the difficulties in reaching women in rural, poor and remote areas of the world.

Once the chances of a mother infecting her baby stood at around 30 percent, but now with the launch of a cocktail of three anti-retroviral drugs that has dropped to only about two percent, Goosby said, adding, “With the Pepfar programme we’ve been able to very specifically target 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa which make up about 85-90% of the paediatric burden on the planet,” said Goosby.

US Secretary of State John Kerry, hosting Tuesday’s ceremony, was also to announce that some 13 countries, from Botswana to Zimbabwe, were close to that all important “tipping point.”

In Ethiopia and Malawi, the ratio of new HIV infections to the increase of patients on treatment is just 3%. The figures are startling.

Ethiopia – which with a population of 84.7m is the most populous African country after Egypt – for instance registered only 11,000 new cases of HIV in adults in 2011.

Launched under former president George W Bush, Pepfar was an initial commitment of around $15bn over five years aimed specifically to provide anti-retroviral drugs to HIV infected people.

That has risen to a budget of about $5.5bn annually, including its contribution to the Global Fund – the world’s largest financing organization of programmes to fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.","['hiv', 'baby', 'millionth', 'countries', 'programme', 'goosby', 'born', 'aids', 'mark', 'set', 'pepfar', 'birth', 'mother', 'drugs', 'hivfree', 'global']","This month somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the one millionth baby will be born without HIV to a mother who suffers from the disease, thanks in large part to a decade-old US aid programme.

"WHO wants HIV patients treated sooner to save lives, halt spread","<br />
        	Some 34 million people worldwide have the HIV virus that causes AIDS and the vast majority of them live in poor and developing countries<br />
        
        	Doctors could save three million more lives worldwide by 2025 if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday",Reuters,2013-06-30 00:00:00,"Doctors could save three million more lives worldwide by 2025 if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday.

While better access to cheap generic AIDS drugs means many more people are now getting treatment, health workers, particularly in poor countries with limited health budgets, currently tend to wait until the infection has progressed.

But in new guidelines aimed at controlling and eventually reducing the global AIDS epidemic, the UN health agency said some 26million HIV-positive people - or around 80% of all those with the virus - should be getting drug treatment.

The guidelines, which set a global standard for when people with the virus should start antiretroviral treatment, were drawn up after numerous studies found that treating HIV patients earlier can keep them healthy for many years and also lowers the amount of virus in the blood, significantly cutting their risk of infecting someone else.

“[This] is not only about keeping people healthy and alive but also about blocking further transmission of HIV,” said Gottfried Hirnschall, the WHO's HIV/AIDS department director.

Some 34 million people worldwide have the HIV virus that causes AIDS and the vast majority of them live in poor and developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is by far the worst affected region.

But the epidemic - which has killed 25million people in the 30 years since HIV was first discovered - is showing some signs of being turned around. The United Nations AIDS program says deaths from the disease fell to 1.7million in 2011, down from a peak of 2.3million in 2005 and from 1.8million in 2010.

Swift progress has also been made in getting more HIV patients into treatment, with 9.7million people getting life-saving AIDS drugs in 2012, up from just 300,000 people a decade earlier, according to latest WHO data also published on Sunday.

Indian generics companies are leading suppliers of HIV drugs to Africa and many other poor countries. Major Western HIV drugmakers include Gilead Sciences, Johnson & Johnson and ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline.

Margaret Chan, the WHO's director general, said the dramatic improvement in access to HIV treatment raised the prospect of the world one day being able to beat the disease.

The guidelines also say all pregnant or breastfeeding women and all children under five with HIV should start treatment immediately, whatever their CD4 count, and that all HIV patients should be regularly monitored to assess their ""viral load.""

This allows health workers to check whether the medicines are reducing the amount of virus in the blood. It also encourages patients to keep taking their medicine because they can see it having positive results.

The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) welcomed the new guidelines but cautioned that the money and the political will to implement them was also needed.

The WHO's Hirnschall said getting AIDS drugs to the extra patients brought in by the new guidelines would require another 10% on top of the $22-$24bn a year currently needed to fund the global fight against HIV and AIDS.","['spread', 'hiv', 'treated', 'wants', 'sooner', 'save', 'halt', 'virus', 'whos', 'patients', 'aids', 'lives', 'health', 'treatment', 'getting', 'guidelines', 'drugs']","Doctors could save three million more lives worldwide by 2025 if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday.

WHO: Health service still inaccessible to HIV-vulnerable groups,"For people who inject drugs, studies show the risks of HIV infection can be also 50 times higher than the general populationFailure to provide adequate HIV services for key groups – men who have sex with men, people in prison, people who inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people – threatens global progress on the HIV response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned",Tribune Report,2014-07-13 00:00:00,"Failure to provide adequate HIV services for key groups – men who have sex with men, people in prison, people who inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people – threatens global progress on the HIV response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.

Although these people are most at risk of HIV infection, they are the least likely to have access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. In many countries they are left out of national HIV plans, and discriminatory laws and policies are major barriers to access.

The observations were made as the WHO on Friday released the “Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations,” in the lead-up to the International AIDS Conference in Australia’s Melbourne beginning on July 20.

The guidelines outline steps for countries to reduce new HIV infections and increase access to HIV testing, treatment and care for these five “key populations.” They include a comprehensive range of clinical recommendations; but, for these to be effective, the WHO also recommended countries to remove the legal and social barriers that prevent many people from accessing services.

For the first time, the WHO strongly recommended men who have sex with men consider taking antiretroviral medicines as an additional method of preventing HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis) alongside the use of condoms.

Modelling estimates that pre-exposure prophylaxis could reduce global HIV incidence by around 20-25% among men who have sex with men, up to 1 million new infections among this group could be averted over 10 years.

Studies also indicate that women sex workers are 14 times more likely to have HIV than other women, men who have sex with men are 19 times more likely to have HIV than the general population, and transgender women are almost 50 times more likely to have HIV than other adults.

For people who inject drugs, studies show the risks of HIV infection can be also 50 times higher than the general population.

“None of these people live in isolation,” said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, director of the HIV Department at WHO. “Sex workers and their clients have husbands, wives and partners. Some inject drugs. Many have children. Failure to provide services to the people who are at greatest risk of HIV jeopardises further progress against the global epidemic and threatens the health and well-being of individuals, their families and the broader community.”

At the International AIDS Conference 2014 in Melbourne, the WHO will call on governments to re-energise and strengthen HIV programmes so that all key populations benefit from the ongoing advances in HIV treatment and programme scale-up.","['services', 'hiv', 'sex', 'women', 'times', 'groups', 'workers', 'inaccessible', 'hivvulnerable', 'key', 'health', 'treatment', 'likely', 'service', 'men']","Failure to provide adequate HIV services for key groups – men who have sex with men, people in prison, people who inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people – threatens global progress on the HIV response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.

Passengers with HIV sue China’s Spring Airlines,"China only lifted a longstanding ban on foreigners with HIV entering the country in 2010Two passengers with HIV are suing a budget Chinese airline for refusing to let them board a plane, BBC reported",Tribune Desk,2014-08-16 00:00:00,"Two passengers with HIV are suing a budget Chinese airline for refusing to let them board a plane, BBC reported.

Local media reports say the two men and a friend - who does not have HIV - were prevented from boarding a Spring Airlines plane at Shenyang airport.

The three of them are accusing the airline of discrimination. A court in Shenyang accepted their case on Friday.

Rights groups say that widespread stigmatisation of people with HIV and Aids still exists in China.

The airline’s president Wang Zhenghua said on Tuesday that the company did not discriminate against HIV carriers, and blamed the incident on staff anxiety, according to the AFP news agency.

But he also blamed the passengers, and said the firm would allow HIV-positive travellers to board their planes as long as they did not make themselves “overly noticeable” to avoid scaring other customers.

Spring Airlines’ website states that it has the right to refuse passage to those with “infectious diseases.” An airline spokesman told Caixin that since the incident, the airline has not turned away any HIV-positive passengers.

According to a report in the Fazhi Evening Paper the three men were preparing to board a flight to Shijiazhuang, which is south of Beijing, on 28 July when they were stopped by officials.

One passenger told the paper: “After we got our boarding passes, we informed a Spring Airlines official that some of us had HIV.”

“The official immediately rang up the Shanghai head office for instructions, and then told us the company has rules forbidding the transportation of passengers with HIV.”

The passenger said they were unable to negotiate with airline officials, who terminated the three passengers’ tickets. They eventually took a train to their destination.

The three plaintiffs are now demanding compensation of 48,999 yuan (£4,771, $7,967) and an apology from the airline, said The Global Times.

Tuberculosis cases in Bangladesh increasing,"'As we are conducting screenings using better equipment this year, we are being able to detect more cases'",Md. Kamrul Hasan,2017-03-24 00:00:00,"WHO is currently also working with NTP on drafting the protocol for a drug resistance survey (DRS) planned for this year. The results of DRS will be able to provide a better understanding of the national situation and the trend of drug resistance to TB in the country

A National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP) report states that the percentage of children infected with TB rose from 4% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016 and the total number of TB patients increased from 57% to 61% between 2015 and 2016. The report, which is based on projects conducted by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), was released on Thursday during a press conference held at the National Press Club in Dhaka. DGHS Microbacterial Diseases Control Programme Director and Line Director (TB and Leprosy) Rouseli Haq said the use of modern equipment had helped detect this increasing number. Saila Islam, head of Brac’s TB project, concurred, saying: “As we are conducting screenings using better equipment this year, we are being able to detect more cases.” However, NTP officials said children generally comprise 10% of the total number of patients found and the fact that the current number is still as low as 4.3% is worrisome as some of the screenings may have failed to detect TB cases. Bangladesh, which is listed among the 30 high TB burden countries, has an annual occurrence of 225 out of every 1,00,000 people and, on average, 45 out of every 1,00,000 die annually because of tuberculosis. According to WHO Global TB report 2016, however, the number of new annual TB cases is a little higher at 362,000.Until last year, a total of 223,922 people were detected with tuberculosis, including 9,700 multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. WHO is providing technical support to authorities to strengthen its activities in addressing the challenges of TB/HIV, MDR-TB and the use of new technologies. According to the WHO report, Bangladesh is the first country to introduce shorter treatment regimen for MDR-TB and has achieved a high cure rate (75%) for MDR-TB patients. WHO is currently also working with NTP on drafting the protocol for a drug resistance survey (DRS) planned for this year. The results of DRS will be able to provide a better understanding of the national situation and the trend of drug resistance to TB in the country. Shamila Sharma, communication officer of the WHO regional office, said the annual decline in TB incidence – which is currently between 1.5% and 2% – is insufficient and needs to be scaled up to at least 10% to 15% for the countries and the region to meet the End TB targets. The global targets seek to reduce TB mortality by 90% and incidence by 80% within 2030.","['resistance', 'report', 'increasing', 'bangladesh', 'ntp', 'mdrtb', 'drug', 'tuberculosis', 'tb', 'patients', 'cases', 'national', 'number']","WHO is currently also working with NTP on drafting the protocol for a drug resistance survey (DRS) planned for this year.

HIV infections plummet since 2001: UN,"<br />
        	2",AFP,2013-09-23 00:00:00,"New HIV infections have plummeted by a third overall since 2001 and more than halved among children, the United Nations said Monday.

Globally, 2.3 million people contracted the AIDS virus last year – down 33% from 2001, while 260,000 children became infected – over a third fewer than in 2009 and 52% down from 2001.

“The annual number of new HIV infections continues to decline with especially sharp reductions in the number of children newly infected with HIV,” said UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe.

Hailing progress in distributing antiretroviral drugs that prevent the transmission of the virus from pregnant women to their unborn children, the UN body said it may be possible to slash new infections among kids by 90% in the next two years.

In its annual report on the state of the global pandemic, the agency said the drugs had prevented more than 670,000 children contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS from 2009 to 2012 alone.

In sub-Saharan Africa – home to 90% of the world’s 3.3 million infected youngsters – the decline was particularly striking.

In Ghana, for instance, 90% of pregnant, HIV-positive women had access to antiretroviral treatment last year, up from just 32% three years earlier.

As a result, the likelihood of women in the country infecting their unborn children dropped from 31% in 2009 to just nine% last year, said UNAIDS.

Increased access to the drug “cocktail” which curtails HIV transmission but does not cure it, has helped reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths among all age groups by 30% since they peaked in 2005, the report said.

In a foreword to the 269-page report, Sidibe hailed “continued progress towards the global vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.”

Last year, 1.6 million people died AIDS-related deaths, down from 1.8 million in 2011 and 2.3 million in 2005.

The report showed that 9.7 million people in low- and middle-income countries, the bulk of those infected, had access to HIV drugs last year, compared to only 1.3 million seven years earlier.

While the hike is impressive, it falls short of a UN target announced two years ago to reach 15 million people by 2015.

And it represents only 34% of the 28.3 million people who need the drugs, under new guidelines released by the World Health Organisation in June.

The increased access to treatment also means that more people are living with HIV, according to UNAIDS.

Some 35.3 million people were living with the virus last year – about 70% of them in sub-Saharan Africa – up from 30 million in 2001.

Sidibe insisted the 2015 target for global access to antiretrovirals remained in sight, but stressed the world must “have the vision and commitment to ensure no one is left behind”.

Obviously, this will put a strain on world purse strings.

UNAIDS said international donor contributions to combating HIV had remained flat since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, and individual countries were increasingly picking up the tab to beat HIV at home.

Last year, nations accounted for 53% of the $18.9bn set aside to fight the virus.

The UN has set a target of $22-24bn by 2015.

Earlier this year, Sidibe insisted the investment would pay off, pointing out that “fewer deaths, less sickness” takes a burden off the healthcare system, allowing HIV-positive people to work and contribute to the economy for longer.

“If we do not pay now, we will pay later, we’ll pay forever,” he said.","['access', 'report', 'hiv', 'infected', 'infections', 'children', 'pay', 'plummet', 'virus', '2001', 'million', 'global']","New HIV infections have plummeted by a third overall since 2001 and more than halved among children, the United Nations said Monday.

Life as a transgender child in Bangladesh,There is too much ugliness in a short time,Bilkis Irani,2018-10-28 00:00:00,"The stigma of being a transgender in Bangladesh still remains | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka Tribune

There is too much ugliness in a short time

Rupa (not real name) is a 14-year-old child who likes lining her eyes with coal pencils and playing dress up. She is a transgender – locally known as hijra – deprived of access to education, healthcare, and the right to live a somewhat decent life in society.

Rupa used to live with a transgender community in Mirpur, Dhaka. She was born in Habiganj, Sylhet where she used to live with her family before. But at the tender age of seven, she had to leave it all behind because she did not fit in.

Named Karim (not real name) by her parents, Rupa’s father bought her typical male clothes when she was younger. Her family introduced her as their son, but she identified as a girl and liked wearing her sister’s clothes. Her orientation and behaviour incited anger within her family; she was beaten and ridiculed and eventually forced to leave home.

“I never went to school, even though all my siblings did. My father did not admit me to school; he said I brought shame to the family and because of me he lost his honour in society,” Rupa told the Dhaka Tribune.

“My family used to call me abnormal. My step-brother hit me regularly to ‘straighten’ me up. They did not even try to understand me,” the teenager said.

Deprived of basic needs

When Rupa fell ill, her family never took her to the hospital.

“My father used to tell me that I am abnormal. He used to say abnormal people do not need any treatment; he said it would be better if I died. My mother would bring me medicine from a dispensary. But I was never taken to any doctors for healthcare,” she told this reporter.

The transgender child laments about never being treated the same as her siblings because she is different.

“My mother took care of my siblings, fed them big pieces of fish and meat, but she always neglected me.”

Rupa’s is not an isolated case. Most transgender children of Bangladesh grow up in a state of insecurity and abuse.

Sexual harassment

In her short life, Rupa has already seen much of the ugly side of life.

After she left home, a lot of people took advantage of her. Some offered to marry her; others wanted sexual relationships and offered to pay her. She was coerced into having sex on several occasions.

“I was very young when some people wanted to employ me as a sex worker. Sometimes people would offer me Tk500-1,000 for a night. They used to touch me inappropriately,” she said.

“I have a boyfriend. I had four other boyfriends before this, but they all left after a few months. Some of them got involved with me because they wanted physical relationships. But their families would never accept me as I am a transgender.”

When asked why she sexually involved herself with her previous boyfriends, she said she was lonely and wanted company; if she did not allow sexual relationships, they would not stay with her. Men took advantage of her because she was an outcast and would not be able to speak out against their wrongdoings.

Discrimination everywhere

Before Rupa became a part of the transgender community in Mirpur, she knew nothing about the risks of unprotected sex. The community educated her on the matter. She now understands how AIDS spreads and how to better shield herself against such diseases.

However, she still does not know if she has already contracted an STD. No hospitals or doctors want to provide services to transgender people.

“The doctors avoid us. They do not want to help us,” Rupa said.

Rekha, who is Rupa’s “guru,” said: “I took her in when she was seven because no one else was there to look after her. All of us face discrimination from an early age – Rupa is no different.

“When she got sick, I took her to a hospital where doctors refused to treat her. This has happened to us all.

“People think we are somehow bad. But why? We are human beings, just like them. We have the right to live safely and with dignity like everyone else.”

Rekha said because transgender people are not accepted in society, they cannot get jobs like everyone else. This is why they have to resort to begging and asking for money from local shops and businesses.

Communities like this largely make their living by doing sex work or extorting money from other people. Currently, there is no widespread system that can support them. But Rupa does not want to spend her life begging for money.

Rupa left the transgender community in Mirpur some time ago, and is currently back in her hometown Habiganj. She now works with a group of transgender people in that area who provide catering service for wedding ceremonies.

Transgender people in Bangladesh

There is a lack of accurate data on the transgender people in the country. According to the Department of Social Services, there are about 10,000 transgender people across the country. However, there is no data on transgender children.

According to the Directorate General of Health Services, around 0.7% of the transgender population has HIV-prevalence, while less than 0.1% are HIV-positive, as of 2015.

The ICDDRB conducted a research on transgender people in Dhaka in 2015. During the research, they spoke with 570 transgender people, of whom 67.2% were found to be involved in sex trade.

Most transgender children are forced to leave home at a very young age, and then they suffer all forms of abuse, said Dr Sharful Islam Khan, head of the HIV and AID program in the ICDDRB’s Infectious Diseases Division.

“The discrimination and abuse that transgender children suffer at a young age leave an impression that affects their adult life too,” he told the Dhaka Tribune. “Most of these people are at high risk of contracting HIV as they are frequently abused sexually.

“Initiatives must be taken by everyone – the government, the NGOs, the healthcare services, and the society in general – to ensure the transgender community are treated equally and have access to a decent life,” he added.

Prostitution policy splits NGOs in top court AIDS case,Disagreement over keeping policies against prostitution and sex-trafficking A US Supreme Court case that challenges a law requiring anti-prostitution policies for HIV/AIDS programs seeking federal money has generated a split among nonprofit groups that counsel sex workers overseas,Tribune Online Report,2013-04-10 00:00:00,"A US Supreme Court case that challenges a law requiring anti-prostitution policies for HIV/AIDS programs seeking federal money has generated a split among nonprofit groups that counsel sex workers overseas.

The case involves a 2003 law that bars funding for groups that work on HIV/AIDS prevention but do not have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.

It has pitted two non-governmental organisations that operate programs overseas, backed by umbrella organisations representing others like them, against 46 organisations that have sided with the federal government in defending the law.

The organisations challenging the provision on First Amendment grounds do not want to take a stand on prostitution. They say the law interferes with their work providing advice and counseling to prostitutes about the risks of HIV infection.

The court on April 22 will consider whether the requirement, which has not been enforced since a 2006 injunction, is valid under the US Constitution.

The 2003 law outlined a plan to fight the spread of the HIV virus that causes AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, part of which would involve providing funding for non-governmental organisations.

"Study: Indian police extort transgender sex workers, increasing HIV risk",The HIV prevalence among India's transgender community is estimated at 7,Thomson Reuters Foundation,2018-01-23 00:00:00,"Police in India routinely extort female transgender sex workers, which pressures them to earn more by engaging in unsafe sex that increases the risk of disease, researchers say.

Gender minorities need more protection and police need sensitivity training, said a report by the Chennai-based Centre for Sexuality and Health Research and Policy (C-SHaRP) and the Mumbai-based Humsafar Trust.

""We found that transgender women have poor earnings and they have to share that too with the police and ruffians who exploit them,"" said Venkatesan Chakrapani, a doctor who chairs C-SHaRP and has researched the transgender community for years.

""Because of this extortion, they try to earn more and do not insist their customers use condoms,"" he added.

The study was based on interviews with 300 transgender women working in the sex industry in major Indian cities. The results showed that they face a high risk of abuse and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

The HIV prevalence among India's transgender community is estimated at 7.5%, much higher than the country's average of 0.3%, government data shows.

Transgender women fear police action under a British colonial-era law that prohibits ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal,"" which is widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex.

""Biologically, most transgender women are born as males, so it is not clear whether they could be penalised for having sex with a man,"" Chakrapani said.

India's 2011 census recorded half a million transgender people, but campaigners estimate the number at about 2 million. Less than half are literate and even fewer have traditional jobs, according to the census.

In a landmark 2014 judgment, the Supreme Court granted legal status to transgender people and made them eligible for quotas in employment and educational institutions.

However, social bias continues and they are denied education and jobs, forcing many of them into the sex industry, campaigners say.

""If they are begging or are engaged in sex work, they face more abuse from the police,"" said Shubha Chacko, executive director of the Solidarity Foundation, which helps transgender people find jobs.

Doley Barman, director of the National Police Academy, said police training includes ""sensitisation modules on dealing with the transgender community,"" as well as visits to areas where trainees can interact with transgender people.","['need', 'hiv', 'study', 'sex', 'women', 'training', 'indian', 'jobs', 'man', 'increasing', 'community', 'extort', 'workers', 'transgender', 'risk', 'million']","Police in India routinely extort female transgender sex workers, which pressures them to earn more by engaging in unsafe sex that increases the risk of disease, researchers say.

The need for premarital health screening,5 reasons why you should,Zefroon Afsary,2018-01-29 00:00:00,"The five medical tests you should do before marriage are:

1. Test for HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases (STDs)

2. Test for blood group

3. Test for sickle cell gene

4. Fertility test

5. Testing for possible genetic/chronic medical conditions

Premarital health screening is characterised as directing examination for couples planning to wed; keeping in mind that the end goal is to recognise if there is any damage with hereditary blood maladies, for example, sickle-cell anemia (SCA) and Thalassemia, and some infectious sicknesses, for example, hepatitis B, C and HIV ""Aids"". This is so as to give restorative counsel on the chances of transmitting these diseases to the next generation later on, and to give choices and alternatives before prospective weds with the point of helping them get ready for a healthy, sound family. This article should not give you cold jitters but rather help you understand the physiology of your partner to build the right kind of diet, habits and plan for children. It is only to help couples equip themselves with the right knowledge and tools to move forward in the together-life. There are many accredited premarital screening centres throughout Bangladesh; in fact any mediocre healthcare facility will provide the service.With prevalent pervasiveness of HIV and different STDs, it is essential that life partners should ask for their accomplices to be screened for these sicknesses prior to marriage. HIV, hepatitis B and C are long lasting conditions that if not legitimately treated can put genuine strain on the marriage.Knowledge of your spouse blood group, through premarital tests, will alert your doctor to institute preventive measures which are used to prevent rhesus incompatibility reactions during pregnancy.Sickle cell Anemia is an incessant and incapacitating medicinal condition caused by deformity in red blood cells. As the name infers, these cells are molded as a 'sickle' and this influence their capacity to go through little veins to supply oxygen to cells and tissue. This calls for most emergencies experienced by sickle cell patients.This may sound strange or unusual, yet frankly, fertility test is one more of the premarital tests that all planning roadsters ought to do before saying “I do.” This is imperative since fertility issues can be tended to but the treatment may span over a long period of time, even a couple of years, yikes! So it is best to start early.Marriage is a deep rooted responsibility with the two partners taking care of each another. Learning of conceivable hereditary or interminable states of your partner will go far in helping the two on the most proficient method to best plan for the difficulties ahead. Early testing permits couples to look for restorative care before the medicinal conditions get to its terminal stage. This test depends on the region and the common chronic/genetic condition seen in that populace. Be that as it may, it should certainly incorporate screening for diabetes, test for hypertension, certain cancers, kidney diseases and test for Thalassemia.","['need', 'test', 'hiv', 'tests', 'couples', 'sickle', 'fertility', 'blood', 'premarital', 'diseases', 'health', 'screening']","Test for HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases (STDs)2.

Let’s talk about AIDS,The key to HIV prevention efforts in Bangladesh is to identify those people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV,Leo Kenny,2013-12-01 00:00:00,"World AIDS Day 2013 is about ending stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV and people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV. Everyone has a right to live a full and productive life with dignity. No one should experience discrimination because of who they are, what they do, or whether they are HIV positive or not.

The challenge for the HIV prevention program now is to overcome stigma and discrimination and reach those in need of HIV testing and treatment. Presently, only 27% of 3,000 adults estimated to be eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are receiving it, despite an estimated 8,000 people living with HIV in Bangladesh.

However, the new WHO guidelines recommend that treatment of people living with HIV starts earlier, when the patient’s CD4 cell count is at 500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood, instead of a CD4 count of 350. CD4 cells are the white blood cells that the virus attacks, and are an indicator of health and immune system status.

This means that people living with HIV can access treatment earlier when they are healthier and their immune system is stronger, which gives better treatment results and reduces the risk of opportunistic infections. Hence, those people living with HIV who are eligible for treatment (ie CD4 count of 500 or lower) will double to approximately 6,000.

Effective ART reduces the number of viral particles in body fluids to undetectable levels, minimising the risk of further transmission. The new WHO guidelines recommend treatment as prevention for couples where one of the partners has HIV; the infected person should start ART irrespective of CD4count in order to prevent transmission to the uninfected partner.

This could be further extended to include all people with HIV with a high risk of transmitting the infection. Therefore, the current efforts to find, test, and treat people who are at risk of contracting or transmitting the virus must be scaled up immediately.

The key to HIV prevention efforts in Bangladesh is to identify those people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV. Yet the attitudes and behaviour of people towards others plays a major factor in the success of the program. Stigma and discrimination hinder the HIV/AIDS response in Bangladesh, and around the world, because individuals who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV fear that identification as a person at risk will cause them to be judged, feared, hated and discriminated against.

Stigma and discrimination disproportionately affect those most vulnerable, including those who are sex workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, transgenders, women and girls.

As a result, people are less likely to engage in safe sex practices, such as using a condom, or seeking education or support services.

Therefore, those who are at risk of becoming infected are more vulnerable to infection, those who are already infected don’t know their HIV status and continue to spread the virus, and those who know they are infected may forego potentially lifesaving treatment, care and support.

Stigma and discrimination must be addressed so that those at risk can feel safe in participating in HIV prevention programs and accessing support services and treatment.

HIV is everyone’s business, and so is ending stigma and discrimination. Recognising and challenging the myths and misconceptions that surround HIV and its transmission is crucial. Education campaigns help to create awareness, but challenging deep-seated value judgments of gender roles and behaviours is crucial to creating safer, more accepting environments.

In order to reach the thousands of Bangladeshis living with HIV, and those at risk of becoming infected with HIV, the HIV prevention program must drastically scale up efforts to find, test, and treat key affected populations.

Support from the Government of Bangladesh, civil society organisations, communities, religious organisations, schools, and others is vital in helping to spread the HIV prevention message and creating an environment where those who are at risk no longer fear stigma and discrimination.

Everybody has a role to play in getting to zero discrimination and supporting the HIV prevention efforts so that Bangladesh will one day be free of HIV/AIDS.","['hiv', 'living', 'efforts', 'talk', 'lets', 'stigma', 'cd4', 'aids', 'prevention', 'treatment', 'discrimination', 'risk', 'infected']","World AIDS Day 2013 is about ending stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV and people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV.

World AIDS day Today,Bangladesh will observe World Aids Day today to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and to honour those who passed from AIDS related complications,Md. Kamrul Hasan,2016-12-01 00:00:00,"Although Bangladesh has had a historically lower rate of HIV infection, a lack of awareness, safe sex practices and detection centers mean public health is still at risk.

World AIDS Day observed,"370 new HIV cases detected in the country
        	This year 370 HIV infections have been detected in the country, along with 95 AIDS cases and 82 related deaths",Tribune Report,2013-12-01 00:00:00,"This year 370 HIV infections have been detected in the country, along with 95 AIDS cases and 82 related deaths.

The information was disclosed by Health Secretary MM Niazuddinin at an exhibition programme held on Sunday at the Bangladesh International Conference Centre (BICC) to mark World AIDS Day.

He said the number of new HIV infections was 338 in 2012, while the number of patients with AIDS was 103 – with 65 dying from the disease.

The first HIV case diagnosed in Bangladesh was in 1989.

He stressed the need to create awareness to counter the stigma attached to the disease, and said its prevalence in Bangladesh was still low, with a recent figure putting the number of people living with HIV at 3,241.

However, the UN estimates the actual number to be between 8,000 and 16,000, which means many cases are left undetected and untreated.

World AIDS Day was observed on Sunday in the city with an elaborate programme to raise awareness of HIV. The programme is aimed especially at youths, to help prevent the spread of the disease in the country.

In a joint initiative of the National AIDS/STD Programme, the Health Ministry and various NGOs, a procession was brought out on Manik Mia Avenue and an exhibition was held at the BICC, reports BSS.

The theme this year was “Three Zeros: zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths.”

Health Minister Rowshan Ershad, who inaugurated the day at the BICC as the guest of honour, also emphasised the need for awareness in order to control HIV infections.

She said: “Most of the people in Bangladesh do not have enough knowledge regarding AIDS and HIV, in particular married women and the younger generation should be educated about the disease to enable its prevention.” The minister urged all people to work together to achieve the target of ‘the three zeros’ by 2015.

President of the network PLHIV Habiba Akhter said very few HIV patients have been given Anti-Retroviral (ARV) treatment, and that many have remained without treatment because of the social stigma.

She said intensive campaigns to increase awareness are needed across the country in order to remove the social stigma and misconception about HIV.

Speakers at the programme also called for regular blood tests for sex workers and drug addicts.

Other speakers were Director General of the Health Service Prof Dr Khandaker M Sefayetullah, UNAIDS Country Coordinator Dr Leo Kenny, WHO Representative to Bangladesh Dr Tushara Fernando, and Bangladesh Medical and Association Secretary General Dr Iqbal Arsalan.

They asked to launch a stronger movement involving all in society by creating awareness and following the social values to build a HIV/AIDS-free Bangladesh.
There is no alternative to creating adequate social awareness among vulnerable people, sex workers, drug users as well as the youth community to lead a safer life to save the future generations from the wrath of the killer diseases, he said."
"As Rohingya numbers surge, Bangladesh worries about various diseases breaking out",The Rohingya have faced health-related discrimination in Myanmar for decades,Tarek Mahmud,2017-10-20 00:00:00,"A large number of the Rohingya who have entered Bangladesh since late August, and thousands of others who continue to cross the border, are sick – many suffering from diseases like Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Polio. About 40% of these new refugees, officially 582,000 so far, are staying in cramped camps while others are living under the open sky or in makeshift camps in Cox’s Bazar. A scarcity of safe water and sanitation facilities has triggered fears among health experts that the living conditions could lead to outbreaks of diseases. An outbreak will be catastrophic – both for the refugees and their host communities. The Rohingya have faced health-related discrimination in Myanmar for decades, where they are denied citizenship and basic rights. A large section of the community had already been suffering from various diseases before they came to Bangladesh because of malnutrition, unhealthy living conditions and a lack of access to healthcare. Bangladeshi health experts say they have identified four major diseases – Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Polio and Aids – in the new batch of refugees. Experts say the diseases will spread if the Rohingya are not kept in a particular area. They warn that germs from coughs, flux, used injections, human filth, garbage and water and air pollution would spread quickly if the living conditions are not improved. Bangladesh could see the outbreak of cholera, tuberculosis, malaria and measles if the refugees are not immediately treated. Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts will be the worst affected areas during such events, health experts say. Fifteen percent of the new arrivals are suffering from diarrhoea, government data show. The World Health Organisation, in a recent report, warned that there could be an outbreak of water-borne and infectious diseases among the Rohingya that would also affect the locals. The government is providing healthcare services to the Rohingya. Under the supervision of Ministry of Health, the Director General of Health Service (DGHS) is working with the Armed Forces Division, UN bodies, and international and local NGOs to deliver health services in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. On its website, the DGHS said 74 static health centers – 25 run by government, 10 by army and 39 by NGOs – were providing health facilities to the refugees. Forty-three mobile medical teams and 231 vaccination teams are working there. Gawher Nayeem Wahra, a teacher at Dhaka University’s Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies, noted that Myanmar did not have an immunisation programme for the Rohingya. He warned that as a result, the latest influx include many Rohingya suffering from malaria, tuberculosis, and polio. “The diseases will spread if they get scattered across the country. It is a big public health issue,” he said. “Eventually, the refugees will be needed to be shifted to Ukhiya and Teknaf where clean water is not easily available.” The government, with the assistance of local and foreign health service providers, is trying to vaccinate the Rohingya but logistical problems mean a large number of the refugees have been left untreated. The infected refugees - who are being treated at hospitals in Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar - also pose a threat to other patients as some of them are suffering from infectious diseases. Among them, government officials say they have identified 51 HIV positive Rohingya patients. Cox’s Bazar Civil Surgeon Dr Mohammad Abdus Salam said 682,000 refugees had been given cholera vaccinations by the government while various local and international organisations have vaccinated another 175,000 Rohingya. Salam told the Dhaka Tribune on Thursday that they had detected 850 Hepatitis patients and about 50 measles-affected Rohingya, who are now being treated. “The Rohingya are suffering from water-borne diseases,” he said. “We found that about 50,000 are infected by flu-type germs while about 15,000 are suffering from skin diseases. About 10,000 were treated for various injuries.” Chittagong Medical College Hospital’s Dr Dev Pratim Barua said: “Rohingyas are suffering from various infectious diseases that may spread among other refugees and locals if we fail to keep them in a special zone under proper monitoring.” His colleague Dr Pranab Kumar Chowdhury warned that Bangladesh would have to pay the price if the sick refugees were not kept under proper surveillance. “As 90% Rohingya are illiterate and unaware about health concerns, there is a huge risk that infectious diseases would spread,” he said. CMCH Director Brig Gen Jalal Uddin Ahmad said: “We opened a separate ward for the Rohingya at the hospital’s outdoor section on October 1 to prevent spread of diseases.” Civil Surgeon Salam said they had taken similar initiatives at Cox’s Bazar Sadar Hospital. Cox’s Bazar Deputy Commissioner Md Ali Hossain said: “We have kept the Rohingya refugees under constant surveillance and are monitoring their movements.”","['refugees', 'surge', 'spread', 'hepatitis', 'worries', 'coxs', 'bangladesh', 'numbers', 'breaking', 'suffering', 'rohingya', 'diseases', 'health', 'bazar', 'various']","A large section of the community had already been suffering from various diseases before they came to Bangladesh because of malnutrition, unhealthy living conditions and a lack of access to healthcare.

Prostitution policy splits NGOs in top court AIDS case,Disagreement over keeping policies against prostitution and sex-trafficking A US Supreme Court case that challenges a law requiring anti-prostitution policies for HIV/AIDS programs seeking federal money has generated a split among nonprofit groups that counsel sex workers overseas,Tribune Online Report,2013-04-10 00:00:00,"A US Supreme Court case that challenges a law requiring anti-prostitution policies for HIV/AIDS programs seeking federal money has generated a split among nonprofit groups that counsel sex workers overseas.

The case involves a 2003 law that bars funding for groups that work on HIV/AIDS prevention but do not have a policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking.

It has pitted two non-governmental organisations that operate programs overseas, backed by umbrella organisations representing others like them, against 46 organisations that have sided with the federal government in defending the law.

The organisations challenging the provision on First Amendment grounds do not want to take a stand on prostitution. They say the law interferes with their work providing advice and counseling to prostitutes about the risks of HIV infection.

The court on April 22 will consider whether the requirement, which has not been enforced since a 2006 injunction, is valid under the US Constitution.

The 2003 law outlined a plan to fight the spread of the HIV virus that causes AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, part of which would involve providing funding for non-governmental organisations.

Elton John and Prince Harry launch bid to 'smash' AIDS stigma,'Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effects on education and other community services for not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment',AFP,2018-07-24 00:00:00,"Prince Harry (left) and Sir Elton John attend a session about the Elton John AIDS Fund on the second day of the AIDS 2018 conference in Amsterdam on Tuesday AFP

'Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effects on education and other community services for not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment'

Elton John joined forces with Britain's Prince Harry to launch a $1.2 billion initiative on Tuesday to ""break the cycle"" of HIV transmission by targeting young men, among whom infections are on the rise.

On the second day of a major international AIDS conference in Amsterdam, the two lent their mega-wattage star power to calls for action to end the lingering stigma around the virus and protect generations to come.

""Young people are the only age group where HIV infections are rising, not falling,"" warned rock star and veteran AIDS campaigner Elton John as he announced the launch of the MenStar Coalition.

""We have to do much, much more to bring men, especially younger men more fully into the fold,"" he insisted.

The coalition brings together different partners, including the UN's Unitaid and the US fund PEPFAR, as John warned that 24- to 35-year-old men were accessing HIV testing and treatment at ""unacceptably low rates"".

Much work has been done to protect women and girls but ""we can't solve the whole problem if we are only addressing half the situation,"" John said.

""If we want to win this fight, if we want to end AIDS once and for all, we must make men part of the solution"" and teach them to protect themselves, ""not only their wives and girlfriends, their sisters, and daughters, but also critically their brothers and their sons.""

Some 15,000 delegates -- researchers, campaigners, activists and people living with the HIV virus which causes AIDS -- have gathered for the five-day war council, amid dire warnings the AIDS epidemic could yet spiral out of control.

""The progress we have fought so hard for is at risk from a dangerous complacency,"" Prince Harry told conference delegates

""Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effects on education and other community services for not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment.""

The new initiative was focused on ""the tough but essential work of truly changing mindsets,"" the Duke of Sussex said.

""Inspired by the growing alarm of the rate of new HIV infections among young women, this campaign is bravely tackling the root of this problem -- the lack of awareness of HIV prevention amongst hard-to-reach young men.""

He urged people to unite around the ""smashing of a deadly stigma"" surrounding HIV, ""and calling out the prejudice that is still there"".

South African actress Charlize Theron agreed as she addressed the day's opening plenary session entitled: ""Breaking the barriers of inequity"".

""We have come a long way as a global community from that moral panic that defined early stages of this epidemic,"" she told the audience.

But she warned that ""most of us now know and understand that HIV is not just about sex or sexuality... We know it is linked to the second-class status of women and girls worldwide.""","['young', 'hiv', 'women', 'stigma', 'smash', 'elton', 'warned', 'prevention', 'aids', 'protect', 'launch', 'john', 'bid', 'harry', 'prince', 'men']","""Young people are the only age group where HIV infections are rising, not falling,"" warned rock star and veteran AIDS campaigner Elton John as he announced the launch of the MenStar Coalition.

‘I don’t want my daughter to grow up ignominiously’,Bonded sex workers in Bangladesh have tough choices,Md Abdul Quayyum,2017-05-21 00:00:00,"A life of extreme poverty

Essential services

Reshmi* (name changed) says she doesn’t enjoy her evening walks in a nice, green park of Dhaka like others do. While a stroll in the park may be a healthy choice for most, for Reshmi it is about survival - she walks every day in the park to hunt clients who will pay to have sex. “People come in the park to enjoy the greenery of it and have fresh air but for me, I come here for my ignominious livelihood, against my will, so that my daughter can continue her studies,” says Reshmi. A young bonded sex worker, Reshmi turns 25 this year, but her life changed at the age of four when her father died in a road accident. “I was living with my family at Khalishpur in Khulna district. My father died in a road accident when I was only four years old and it was very hard for my mother to arrange meals, three times a day, let alone study. I never got a chance for schooling.”She continues to share her miserable childhood - “to handle the situation, my mother sent me to Dhaka for domestic work and I had been doing that for a few years. But when I turned 13, my mother forced me to get married to an older man, without my consent. I didn’t want to get married at that age so I escaped with a friend of mine, to change my luck. But worse came to worst, and I was trapped in sex slavery. Since then I am part of this trade,” Reshmi says. After attending to three or four clients a day at a hotel near the park, Reshmi gets back to her little, damp house at midnight to catch a few hours of sleep. The house is only rented for nights at double the regular price, and on condition that she cannot show her face there during the day. She hardly gets the time to shower or have breakfast before it's time for her to leave. As a hapless sex worker, she was lured by the promise of a better life by a man she married when she was 18, only to later find he was a human trafficker who planned to sell her across the border. At the time, Reshmi was pregnant and that actually saved her from being trafficked. She became the mother of a beautiful daughter at 19 and was instantly abandoned by her husband. Sh had not a single penny with which to feed her daughter and had to return to the sex trade again. “Many a time, I faced gang rape and sex without condoms. I was heavily injured at times and managed to escape from being murdered. But I want to give my daughter an education, a good life. That’s why I need money and have to keep myself safe from diseases,” Reshmi says.As there was no one to look after her baby during work hours, Reshmi was struggling with her daughter. She had no place to rest from dawn to dusk, except under the open sky, and no option of getting a health check. Then she came across the ‘Drop-in-Center’ of Save the Children where she is now enlisted for essential services. In the centre, Reshmi is learning different life skills, getting basic education and receiving counselling on safer sex and HIV prevention. The lessons enable her to remain in good health to earn her livelihood and increases her confidence to negotiate with the clients for condom use. There is also a ‘Hotline’ and ‘Community Squad’ introduced by Save the Children and its partner organisation for the sex workers for any kind of help, like when faced with violence. “I wanted to test my blood to be sure about HIV following the advice I got from the drop-in-centre. The test was negative. I go there everyday now. I have learned what to do in emergencies and how to seek police assistance. It helped me save my life,” said Reshmi. It is estimated that there are 1,02,260 female sex workers in Bangladesh who are at high risk of HIV. Save the Children and its partner organisations have brought 26,000 female sex workers under their coverage to provide essential services through 43 drop-in-centres in 26 districts and bring them under universal health access with financial support from the Global Fund. While it's uncertain if Reshmi and her daughter can live a happy life in the near future, there is always hope from Save the Children that armed with an education, her daughter will be able to choose a different path.","['day', 'dont', 'sex', 'children', 'workers', 'save', 'reshmi', 'grow', 'daughter', 'mother', 'life', 'ignominiously', 'park']","She became the mother of a beautiful daughter at 19 and was instantly abandoned by her husband.

Toward an AIDS-free generation,"Young people must be treated with dignity, respect and without moral judgement, regardless of whether or not they use drugs, who they have sex with and why, or whether they are HIV positive or not
        	As the world’s population continues to increase we are seeing the rise of the largest population of young people that the world has ever known",Leo Kenny,2013-10-22 00:00:00,"As the world’s population continues to increase we are seeing the rise of the largest population of young people that the world has ever known. UNAIDS envisages an AIDS-free generation, but it is young people who must, and will, make this vision a reality.

As UN Day draws near, it is important to highlight young people as the change-makers that they are, as the greatest hope for getting to zero. That’s “Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths.”

Bangladesh is a country that has low HIV prevalence, but continues to be high risk. This means that demographic factors such as population density, poverty, gender inequality and porous national borders remain challenges to the AIDS epidemic. HIV prevalence in Bangladesh remains low at 0.01% of the general population; however, some features of the HIV epidemic in Bangladesh warrant more attention.

The Global AIDS Report 2013 identified Bangladesh as one of four countries in the Asia Pacific region where the rate of new HIV infection increased by over 25% between 2001 and 2011, and that young people (aged 15-24 years) account for an estimated 50% of all new HIV infections compared with 40% worldwide, revealing that young people are more important than ever for HIV prevention in Bangladesh.

A combination of appropriate education and services for young people are the first steps toward HIV prevention and eradication. When young people receive correct, complete information about HIV and AIDS they gain the power to make informed decision with regards to their sexual health and behaviour.

Yet only 17.7% of young people in Bangladesh are estimated to have comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention and a fewer proportion access to lifesaving services. The ever present challenge to HIV prevention continues to be limited access to HIV prevention information and services that are tailored to the unique needs of young people, particularly sexual and reproductive health and HIV treatment services. Moreover, educating people early on in life helps people to avoid unsafe behaviours and scenarios where they may be at risk of HIV infection.

Not only does HIV education and awareness helps to defuse the stigma and discrimination facing people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, or are living with HIV, but it is also vital in enabling people to access services. Without access to services for testing and treatment, people are unable to learn about their HIV status and consequently unable to protect themselves and others against infection. Services that incorporate the unique needs of young people are especially important, because young people have different needs with regards to information, counselling, testing, condoms, harm-reduction strategies and care for sexually transmitted infections including relationships than others.

The perceptions of others around being a young person, whether they be perceived as a victim, a deviant, or other, can influence the behaviour of a young person and have unintended consequences.

Young people must be treated with dignity, respect and without moral judgement, regardless of whether or not they use drugs, who they have sex with and why, or whether they are HIV positive or not. In doing so, systems that protect them from abuse, exploitation and violence should be enabled and strengthened.

HIV is everyone’s business and more young people need to be engaged in the conversation about HIV prevention, treatment, and care for the benefit of all. Around the world, collective voices and community action has proven to be vital in defusing the stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV and AIDS.

The onus of reliable information, attitudes that transform social stigma, and the accessibility of services and support depend on community and religious leaders, schools, parents and young people. Young people can and will be the driving force for Getting to Zero, but HIV prevention education and services by all are the first steps to empowering young people as change-makers for our future.","['young', 'services', 'hiv', 'access', 'bangladesh', 'aidsfree', 'information', 'zero', 'prevention', 'treatment', 'generation', 'population']","UNAIDS envisages an AIDS-free generation, but it is young people who must, and will, make this vision a reality.

MSF holds symposium on sexual and gender-based violence care,The need for medical and psychological care has to be met to help the victims with their trauma,Rifat Islam Esha,2017-07-27 00:00:00,"The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hosted a symposium on Thursday attended by stakeholders of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) care from different organisations. The conference focused on services such as medical and legal aid that can be accessed by women who face SGBV. It emphasised on a “comprehensive approach on learning from different models of SGBV programmes based on current experiences and challenges.” Specialists in the field of SGBV discussed the various challenges women face in different strata of economic classes – especially women who are domestic violence survivors, slum-dwellers, sex workers and residents of disaster-prone areas. The symposium aimed to help different players, including governmental authorities and relevant partners, working in SGBV care “to understand overlapping dimensions of the topic for sustainable solutions.” The event began with a welcome address by MSF Head of Mission, Pavlo Kolovos. It also emphasised the need to spread awareness about health care and psychosocial and legal services to women who usually do not know where to go to seek help. Additional Director of Department of Women Affairs under the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs Shahnowas Dilruba Khan took part in the symposium as the chief guest. She said: “The collaboration between government and non-government organisations will strengthen the endeavour to achieve the SDG on gender equality and equity.” The presentations were followed by a panel chaired by MSF Medical Coordinator in Bangladesh Dr Mitchell Sangma. The panel included specialists from One Stop Crisis Centre (OCC), ICDDR,B, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Department of Forensic Medicine of Dhaka Medical College. Senior Scientist in SBGV at ICDDR,B Dr Ruchira Tabassum stressed on the need of “prevention” from sexual violence which requires a massive social change. She also urged the government organisations to collaborate with NGOs to make such prevention effective. According to Kolovos: “Sexual and gender-based violence must be addressed as a very significant factor of any society. The need for medical and psychological care has to be met to help the victims with their trauma."" ""MSF is working in Kamrangirchar, assisting those who have difficulty to access other SGBV care. Our aim is to ensure free and timely access to good quality medical care as well as to improve the victims’ dignity. A sustained, long-term, and broad-based effort is needed to assist both victims and those at risk,” he added. MSF's Kamrangirchar urban slum project started in 2010. They have been actively working towards improving women's access to reproductive health care, enhancing access to medical services for survivors of sexual and domestic violence, and providing primary health care for factory workers. SGBV Cluster Coordinator of UNFPA Saba Zariv discussed how their teams provide essential psychological and medical help to survivors in disaster-prone areas. The One-Stop Crisis Centre also provides necessary services to victims of sexual violence. Project Director of Multi-Sectoral Programme on Violence against Women Dr Abdul Hossain, who also supervises and coordinates the activities of OCC, said women with SGBV complaints can very easily access their helpline by calling 109. Dr Sangma concluded the panel by asking vital questions regarding SGBV: “Are there still victims of rape, domestic violence, and HIV who are seeking health care and counselling? Are there still girls who report violence to police to seek justice? Can an adolescent boy learn in school that violence against women is unacceptable? Can the media respect the confidentiality and dignity of survivors?” “Until the answer to all of these is yes, we have a long way to go,” he added. The event ended with a vote of thanks by MSF Project Coordinator Arunn Jegan.","['access', 'medical', 'holds', 'women', 'sexual', 'sgbv', 'survivors', 'violence', 'care', 'msf', 'genderbased', 'victims', 'symposium']","The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hosted a symposium on Thursday attended by stakeholders of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) care from different organisations.
Senior Scientist in SBGV at ICDDR,B Dr Ruchira Tabassum stressed on the need of “prevention” from sexual violence which requires a massive social change.
According to Kolovos: “Sexual and gender-based violence must be addressed as a very significant factor of any society.

Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria,"'Every time you introduce a new class of antibiotic to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant,' said Dr Teodora Wi from WHO",Tribune Desk,2017-10-01 00:00:00,"What is gonorrhoea?

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a new strain of untreatable bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as “super” gonorrhoea, is likely to spread through oral sex, reports the Independent. Oral sex and a decline in the use of condoms are reportedly behind the spread. The sexually transmitted infection (STI) is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics, therefore making the situation quite grave. According to the BBC, about 78 million people pick up the STI each year. In a study from 2009 to 2014, the WHO analysed data from 77 countries which showed gonorrhoea’s resistance to antibiotics becoming widespread. The bacteria became resistant to the first-line medicine ciprofloxacin, further increasing resistance to another antibiotic drug called azithromycin, and resistance to last resort treatments known as extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). Dr Teodora Wi from the WHO said there had been three cases – in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable, reports the Forbes. She said: “Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug. Every time you introduce a new class of antibiotic to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant.” One of the reasons this antibiotic-resistant bacteria is spreading is due to unprotected oral sex, where it can transmit Neisseria gonorrhoeae from a person’s privates to one’s throat and vice versa. Once transmitted via oral sex, the infection shows no symptoms on its own, but mimics other typical symptoms of throat infections such as strep throat or sore throat. Therefore, Dr Wi said that treating the infections like a normal sore throat mixes with the Neisseria species in the throat, resulting in resistance. The WHO is calling on countries to monitor the spread of resistant gonorrhoea and to invest in new drugs. Ultimately, the WHO said vaccines would be needed to stop gonorrhoea, reports the BBC.It is a sexually transmitted infection, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Untreated gonorrhoea can further lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, also increasing the risk of getting HIV.","['bacteria', 'resistance', 'spread', 'neisseria', 'sex', 'oral', 'spreading', 'resistant', 'unstoppable', 'transmitted', 'throat', 'gonorrhoea', 'infection']","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a new strain of untreatable bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as “super” gonorrhoea, is likely to spread through oral sex, reports the Independent.

Migrant workers’ dreams end in body bags,"Bangladesh received 33,000 bodies of migrant workers since 2005; workload, poor living conditions, heart disease blamed for deaths",Afrose Jahan Chaity,2017-12-18 00:00:00,"The medical issues

Delay in repatriating bodies

The hard-earned money sent home by millions of migrant workers is one of the biggest sources of foreign currency for Bangladesh. Expatriate workers remitted around $14.93 billion last year. As hundreds of thousands leave the country every year to try their luck, thousands also return, albeit in coffins and body bags. Bodies of 33,112 migrant workers have been received between 2005 and November this year, government figures show. But the number of deaths is believed to be higher as many workers are buried abroad. A large number of these deaths are attributed to heart attacks and stroke. Many of the victims are young. As many as 11.39 million Bangladeshis have migrated between 1976 and 2017, according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET). Dhaka University’s international Relations Professor CR Abrar pointed out that everyone had to take extensive medical tests before they were permitted to work abroad. “This issue cannot be taken lightly,” he said. “We need to investigate and uncover the reasons why they are dying while working abroad even though they were medically fit before leaving the country.” Brac’s Migration Head Shariful Islam Hasan claimed that adverse working environment, excessive workload, poor living conditions, heart attack and stroke caused by mental stress were behind 94% of the migrant deaths. Some others are killed in accidents, commit suicide or are murdered, he added citing data he gathered when working as a reporter. In the first 11 months of this year, 3,154 bodies of migrant workers were received, according to Wage Earners Welfare Board (WEWB) of Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment. Shariful claimed that at least eight to 10 bodies were sent to Bangladesh daily. Many workers have been buried abroad after their deaths. One of the unfortunate victims was twenty-six-year-old Delwar Hossain, who went to Malaysia in 2013 to work at a palm oil farm. His employer claimed that he had died of a heart attack on January 29 this year. The pictures provided by Delwar’s employer showed his body lying under the bed. His family members alleged that he had been murdered. “He had some problems with a coworker. The foreman had beaten him several times after refusing to work extra hours. They did not let him eat or sleep properly,” his younger brother Abul Kalam Azad told the Dhaka Tribune. Before going abroad, a person needs to undergo many medical tests to determine whether he or she is suffering from a list of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Gulf Approved Medical Centers Association said an aspirant migrant worker needs to be tested for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, HCV, malaria, tuberculosis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, psychiatric diseases, neurological disorders and physical disabilities, among others. “Sometimes the employers claim their workers had committed suicide or mention heart failure or stroke as the cause of death to avoid paying compensation,” Prof Abrar noted. “When a family receives the body of loved ones it is normal that they do not investigate further. Last rites get the top priority.” Brac official Shariful emphasised ensuring the rights of the migrant workers, pointing out how the overseas employers violated labour law. The migrant workers are easily exploited, he said. They are under pressure to pay back loans they had taken before travelling abroad and the employers take advantage of their desperate mental state to force them to work extra hours with little pay. Shafiqul Islam, director of Wage Earners Welfare Board, said the migrant workers could inform the complaint cell. “When they inform us about the violence they face, we immediately inform our embassy or the concerned country to look into the matter and rescue our worker,” he said. Shafiqul said the government provided Tk35,000 to families of each dead worker when they receive the body in Dhaka. If the worker was legal, the family gets another Tk3 lakh. WEWB Assistant Director (Information and Public Relations) Zahid Anwar said that if family members of a deceased expatriate express doubt about the cause of death and apply for re-autopsy, the board forwards their plea to the concerned Bangladeshi embassy. ""But the family will have to apply before the body of the deceased arrives in Bangladesh. If the body reaches home, then the government of the employer country may reject the application,"" said Zahid. He, however, did not clarify if Bangladesh accepts, without contest, the cause of death as stated by the employer or what it does if the family’s claim contradicts that of the stated cause. Shafiqul also did not say anything about how the government ascertains the cause of death of migrant workers in cases such as that of Delwar. [caption id=""attachment_234581"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""] Fifteen Bangladeshi migrants who were held captive by Sunni militants in war-torn Iraq for 24 days finally returned home on July 19, 2014[/caption]It takes quite some time for the body of a migrant worker to be sent home, notably from Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh’s largest manpower export market. Prof CR Abrar pointed out that the time needed depended on the official processes of different countries. “Every country has different procedures and documentation processes. The delay in sending back bodies are probably because of communication gap or lack of proper documentation, or lack of coordination,” Abrar said. “Sending back the bodies should get the top priority at our missions.” WEWB Director Shafiqul said whenever they receive the news of a migrant worker’s death, they first take a written statement from the family on whether or not they want the body. “If they do, we forward the papers to the concerned embassy to take care of the repatriation process,” he said. Shafiqul said the process was lengthy in Saudi Arabia. “They conduct several inquiries to determine the cause of deaths. Sometimes it takes between two weeks and six months and sometimes more. It takes more time if it is a suicide case or accident death,” he added.","['heart', 'bags', 'shafiqul', 'abroad', 'dreams', 'family', 'death', 'worker', 'body', 'workers', 'end', 'migrant', 'cause']","The medical issuesDelay in repatriating bodiesThe hard-earned money sent home by millions of migrant workers is one of the biggest sources of foreign currency for Bangladesh.

Daily coffee and chocolate helps to cure liver diseases,"Eating chocolate and drinking 3 or more cups of coffee everyday can lower levels of two common enzymes that are the markers of liver diseasesCoffee is a very popular, and so is chocolate",Dr Sajol Ashfaq,2014-02-21 00:00:00,"Coffee is a very popular, and so is chocolate. Recently a study has found that both coffee and chocolate are good for liver especially when the liver is infected by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and HCV (Hepatitis C Virus).

The study found that patients coinfected with HIV and HCV who reported eating chocolate daily and drinking three or more cups of coffee a day had lower levels of ALT and AST. AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) are the two common liver enzymes that are the markers representing the inflammation in the liver and we can know their level by blood tests. People with HIV and/or hepatitis C have routinely checked ALT and AST levels.

An article published in the January 2014 issue of Journal of Hepatology describes how drinking more coffee and eating more chocolate may be associated with lower levels of liver enzymes in people living with HIV and hepatitis C (HCV).

The key to these observations are the presence of polyphenols, or a type of anti-oxidant that have anti-inflammatory properties. Similar polyphenols are found in both coffee and chocolate, and it appears that higher levels of these anti-oxidants are what are lowering ALT and AST levels.

The study showed that drinking three or more cups of coffee daily, and eating chocolate each day, were each associated with more normal levels of ALT. When combined, they represented a 40–50% lower lever of abnormal liver enzymes.

Also drinking more coffee each day was associated with more normal AST levels. But researchers said these results need to be confirmed by further experimental and observational research.","['alt', 'daily', 'hiv', 'diseases', 'study', 'lower', 'helps', 'drinking', 'levels', 'chocolate', 'liver', 'coffee', 'ast', 'cure']","Recently a study has found that both coffee and chocolate are good for liver especially when the liver is infected by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and HCV (Hepatitis C Virus).

"World Watch September 6, 2013",Indian court orders bus firm to rehire driver with HIV,Tribune Report,2013-09-06 00:00:00,"Indian court orders bus firm to rehire driver with HIV

An Indian court has ordered a public transport authority to rehire a sacked HIV-positive bus driver in a “landmark” case for those stigmatised for having the virus, the man’s lawyer said Friday. The man was working in the western city of Pune when he became HIV positive in 2008, leading him to require a less heavy-duty job than driving, his advocate Asim Sarode said. He took the case to the Bombay High Court, arguing that “capacity to work is more important than HIV status. This is definitely against human rights,” his lawyer said. On Wednesday, the court said the man must be reinstated within seven days and another hearing will be held to decide on his compensation.

Mohakhali warehouse fire burns contraception meant for the poor,'The fire was brought under control at 8am with the help of 14 firefighting units',Md. Kamrul Hasan,2017-04-10 00:00:00,"The Directorate General of Family Planning warehouse in Mohakhali that stored contraceptives intended for HIV and STD prevention programmes has been severely damaged in a fire on Sunday. The fire broke out at 12:30am and took almost eight hours for firefighters to douse the fire completely. The source of the fire has yet to be determined. Duty Inspector of the Fire Service Mahmud Hasan said: “The fire was brought under control at 8am with the help of 14 firefighting units.” Although 14 units arrived at the site at night, only five of them remained from 4am till 8am working to douse the fire. Officer-in-Charge of Fire Service Headquarters Enayet Hossain said the reason why it took eight hours to douse the fire was because the source of water was far from the warehouse. “We had to alternate between filling the firetrucks with water and dousing the fire, which is why it took so long to bring it under control,” he said adding the warehouse housed some highly flammable goods including condoms which also exacerbated the problem. Hanifur Rahman, additional director (drugs and store) of the Directorate, said contraceptives, condoms and other HIV and STD medication was stored at the warehouse for nationwide distribution. There contraceptives were meant to be distributed in 12 brothels in Bangladesh but were being stored at the warehouse as the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP) ended in November last year. HIV activists and NGOs have been demanding the programme be resumed to stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases among sex workers. Director General of Health Services Professor Abul Kalam Azad told the Dhaka Tribune that they along with other stakeholders were working on resuming the programme. Three probe committees have been formed by the Family Planning Ministry and the DGFP to find the cause of the fire and estimate the financial loss from it. Director General of DGFP Mostafizur Rahman said they formed a five-member committee led by Ferdous Alam, director (IEM) also line director (IEC), to investigate the cause of the fire and another inventory committee was formed under Mohammad Sharif (MCH Services), also line director (MCRAH). The two committees were asked to submit their reports within five working day, he added. Meanwhile, ministry sources said they too have formed a five-member probe committee led by Joint Secretary Abdul Maleque which has been asked to submit its report within five working days.","['warehouse', 'mohakhali', 'burns', 'contraception', 'hiv', 'director', 'formed', 'general', 'took', 'programme', 'working', 'meant', 'stored', 'poor', 'douse']","The Directorate General of Family Planning warehouse in Mohakhali that stored contraceptives intended for HIV and STD prevention programmes has been severely damaged in a fire on Sunday.

First day of ICAAP 12 marked by mismanagement,"Day one of the International Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, (ICAAP) 12, organised for the first time in Bangladesh, was marked by mismanagement",Adil Sakhawat,2016-03-12 00:00:00,"Day one of the International Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, (ICAAP) 12, organised for the first time in Bangladesh, was marked by mismanagement.

The largest international AIDS forum was inaugurated in the afternoon by President Md Abdul Hamid.

The registered foreign delegates attending the conference however complained about mismanagement on the very first day.

Among the delegates, Khartini Slamah, the TG Programme Officer of Global Fund ISEAN Hivos Programme, PT Foundation, said to Dhaka Tribune: “Everyone is lost when they are searching a way to what is going on around here.”

“I think the one who is the in-charge of organising this programme is not clear about organising an international conference here in Bangladesh,” Khartini also added.

Many foreign delegates complained to Dhaka Tribune that they had not received their registration card and bag, which includes the session description and directions.

Some did not even get lunch after paying the registration and other fees, observed this reporter.

Khartini also expected to see the participation of young people, such as students, as the conference was about AIDS awareness.

“The committee should have a look at these problems, like briefing the volunteers who are here to help direct the delegation,” she added.

The people who paid to be delegation members became frustrated over these issues, which must be addressed, said many delegates.

Another delegate from the UK, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I have attended so many conferences around the world. But this is the first time I became so confused after seeing the mismanagement.”

Khartini marked the management of the conference as 3.5 out of 10.

Another delegate, IOM official Samir Kumar Howlader, while attending a session, complained about the mismanagement as two to three sessions were running in a single room at International Convention City Bashundhara. Participants of each session were facing problems participating due to the chaotic environment.

While addressing the complaints and problems faced by the delegates, ICAAP12 Co-Chair Prof Dr AKM Nurun Nabi acknowledged the mismanagement.

He said: “This type of large event is taking place for the first time in Bangladesh. So, on the first day of the event, there is bound to be a disaster, which we also faced when we attended conferences in other countries.”

But he acknowledged the disaster by pointing out the lack of Bangladeshi event management companies with experience organising this type of international conference.

He also said he hopes to sort out the problems from the next day.

When this reporter tried to contact the joint organiser, Partners in Population and Development (PPD), no one responded to the reporter’s query.

In the afternoon, President Hamid in his speech marked the discrimination faced by AIDS patients as “saddening.”

He said: “AIDS is not a curse. But AIDS patients suffer negligence, which they do not deserve.”

He urged people to change their perception about AIDS and called everyone to be broad-minded.

The president also said: “We have to give more attention to find the HIV patients who are living in disguise, because their cases seem to become a serious threat to spreading HIV among the public.

“It is time for an end to discrimination and stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. The plight of the AIDS widows, AIDS orphans or for that matter the children and spouses of those living with AIDS is very challenging.

This year, about 1,000 representatives from 56 countries are participating in the International Congress, jointly organised by the Health and Family Welfare ministry and Partners in Population and Development (PPD).

Health Minister Mohammed Nasim chaired the programme, which was addressed by, among others, State Minister for Health Zahid Maleque, Health Secretary Sayed Monjurul Islam, ICAAP Secretary-General Joe Thomas and Unicef representative Philippe Cori.","['day', 'international', 'marked', '12', 'delegates', 'programme', 'patients', 'aids', 'problems', 'president', 'icaap', 'session', 'mismanagement', 'conference', 'organising']","Day one of the International Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, (ICAAP) 12, organised for the first time in Bangladesh, was marked by mismanagement.

Top AIDS experts feared killed in MH17 crash,"Dozens of leading HIV experts were feared killed when a Malaysian plane was shot down over Ukraine, fuelling concerns that research on curing the disease could suffer",Reuters,2014-07-18 00:00:00,"Dozens of leading HIV experts were feared killed when a Malaysian plane was shot down over Ukraine, fuelling concerns that research on curing the disease could suffer.

Among them was Joep Lange, who researched the condition for more than 30 years and was considered a giant in the field, admired for his tireless advocacy for access to affordable AIDS drugs for HIV positive patients living in poor countries.

""Global health and the AIDS response have lost one of their great leaders,"" Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and a former executive director of UNAIDS, told Reuters in London.

""Joep Lange was one of the most creative AIDS researchers, a humanist, and tireless organizer, dedicated to his patients and to defeating AIDS in the poorest countries.""

The United Nations AIDS program, UNAIDS, said it feared ""some of the finest academics, health-care workers and activists in the AIDS response may have perished"" on the plane.

""Professor Lange was a leading light in the field since the early days of HIV and worked unceasingly to widen access to antiretroviral medicines around the world,"" it said.

As many as 100 people heading to the AIDS 2014 conference in Melbourne were on the doomed flight, Fairfax Media reported, including Lange, a former president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) which organizes the event.

""The UNAIDS family is in deep shock...""The deaths of so many committed people working against HIV will be a great loss for the AIDS response,"" said Michel Sidibé, executive director of UNAIDS.

The conference, due to start on Sunday, features former US President Bill Clinton among its keynote speakers and is expecting around 12,000 participants.

The IAS said it was still working with authorities to confirm the number of delegates on the flight and would go ahead with the conference as planned.","['hiv', 'experts', 'mh17', 'director', 'working', 'tireless', 'killed', 'lange', 'aids', 'response', 'conference', 'feared', 'president', 'unaids', 'crash']","Dozens of leading HIV experts were feared killed when a Malaysian plane was shot down over Ukraine, fuelling concerns that research on curing the disease could suffer.

A girl child is abused every minute: child rights activists,"<br />
        	Across the country about 20,000 children work as commercial sex workers on the streets",Udisa Islam,2013-06-01 00:00:00,"When you are at a traffic signal in the city, you will see children rushing up to sell you various items. Some are selling flowers and sweets, or carrying stacks of books in their thin arms, others wipe the windscreen of cars with dirty rags and beg to be paid. Many of the children on the streets are little girls.

The reality behind the scene is very grim because activists say most of these girls have been abused. Every minute, one girl child is abused in Bangladesh.

Child rights activists report girls face various kinds abuse, including sexual abuse. There are no specific safeguards in place to protect girls in our society, and activists say the state fails to protect them as well.

The number of street children in Bangladesh is estimated to be around 400,000. Nearly half live in the capital, and a large percentage are young girls, and they are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.

According to a 2012 report by Unnayan Onneshan, an independent research centre, nearly 19% of girl street children are forced into prostitution, and many resort to selling on the streets when they fall sick.

Selina (not her real name) is a former child prostitute, who has been selling sweets on the roads for two years. The teenager said she no longer “takes on clients” because she is HIV positive. Activists say almost 45% of girls with various medical conditions like Selina’s do not receive any treatment from state medical facilities or clinics.

Fahima Nasrin, vice president of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA), said across the country about 20,000 children work as commercial sex workers on the streets.

However, the sexual abuse taking place in homes, schools and public places is often shrouded in secrecy. She said the issue is mostly under-reported due to social stigmas related to revelations.

Wahida Banu, executive director of Aparajeyo Bangladesh, a child rights organisation, said child sexual abuse is a taboo not addressed in our society.

“We do not openly discuss it, just like child labour, trafficking and exploitation. In the National Child Policy 2011, sexual abuse was given some attention under the broad heading of child safety. No specific section was devoted to the area of children’s sexual exploitation.”

She said children who are sexually abused face many difficulties;they suffer from depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse, ill health due to sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/Aids, unsafe abortions, and traumatised. But they do not get any assistance from the state to help then live a healthy and normal life.

Wahida Banu believes sex education and school-based programmes can raise awareness about the issue of children’s sexual abuse.

In 1990, Bangladesh ratified the United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which recognises children as anyone below the age of 18, it is based on four general principles of non-discrimination and the best interest of the child, guaranteeing every child the right to life, survival and development and participation. The Convention guarantees every child the right to a childhood (including protection from harm), to education, health, to be treated fairly and to be heard.

Activists said all or some of the above principles are violated when a child is sexually exploited. The

state, thus, cannot ignore its primary responsibility towards children, which is to protect and advance children’s rights.","['activists', 'rights', 'girl', 'children', 'sexual', 'bangladesh', 'abuse', 'minute', 'girls', 'state', 'child', 'abused', 'various']","Child rights activists report girls face various kinds abuse, including sexual abuse.

"Drug company defends 5,000% price rise","The head of a US pharmaceutical company has defended his company's decision to raise the price of a 62-year-old medication used by Aids patients by over 5,000%",BBC Online,2015-09-22 00:00:00,"The head of a US pharmaceutical company has defended his company's decision to raise the price of a 62-year-old medication used by Aids patients by over 5,000%.

Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to Daraprim in August.

CEO Martin Shkreli has said that the company will use the money it makes from sales to research new treatments.

The drug is used treat toxoplasmosis, a parasitic affliction that affects people with compromised immune systems.

After Turning's acquisition, a dose of Daraprim in the US increased from $13.50 (£8.70) to $750.

The pill costs about $1 to produce, but Mr Shkreli, a former hedge fund manager, said that does not include other costs like marketing and distribution.

""We needed to turn a profit on this drug,"" Mr Shkreli told Bloomberg TV. ""The companies before us were just giving it away almost.""

On Twitter, Mr Shkreli mocked several users who questioned the company's decision, calling one reporter ""a moron"".

'Cost is unjustifiable'

The Infectious Diseases Society of America, the HIV Medicine Association and other health care providers wrote an open letter to Turning, urging the company to reconsider.

""This cost is unjustifiable for the medically vulnerable patient population in need of this medication and unsustainable for the health care system,"" the groups wrote.

Dr Wendy Armstrong of HIV Medicine Association also disputed the need to develop new treatments for toxoplasmosis.

""This is not an infection where we have been looking for more effective drugs,"" she told Infectious Disease News.

On Wall Street, biotech shares fell sharply on Monday after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to take action against firms hiking prices for specialty drugs.

""Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous,"" Mrs Clinton said, citing Daraprim.","['need', 'told', 'price', 'defends', 'company', 'daraprim', 'rise', 'drug', 'used', 'specialty', 'mr', 'shkreli', '5000', 'medicine']","The head of a US pharmaceutical company has defended his company's decision to raise the price of a 62-year-old medication used by Aids patients by over 5,000%.

Educate to protect,"Improve education on health issues, prevention is always preferable Bangladesh has been fortunate in being able to maintain a relatively low prevalence of HIV infection",Tribune Editorial,2014-11-30 00:00:00,"Bangladesh has been fortunate in being able to maintain a relatively low prevalence of HIV infection.

Awareness and health education programs under the National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Program have played a key role in preventing HIV from spreading within most-at-risk populations.

By discouraging the use of shared needles among addicts and highlighting the importance of safe sexual practices, this is believed to have kept the total number of infected individuals under 15,000.

It is important to keep up these efforts in order to strive towards the World Aids Day target of ensuring no new patients are infected. As a nation that still spends far below the World Health Organisation target of 5% of GDP on the health sector, we cannot afford to see past successes squandered by ignorance or unwillingness to face the facts about serious health risks.

With our young population and growing trade and migration, health professionals need to keep renewing efforts with educational, community, and religious organisations to improve education on health issues.

In the last 40 years, Bangladesh has been relatively successful in increasing life expectancy and ensuring high rates of immunisation and treatment coverage. With a the essential drugs policy helping to create a thriving and efficient pharmaceutical industry, there is much sound progress to build on.

However, the government cannot afford to be complacent. The country faces both the healthcare challenges of poverty, such as malnutrition and an obesity epidemic caused by growing wealth.

Prevention is always preferable and cheaper. We must continue to improve education about all types of health risks.","['educate', 'target', 'hiv', 'infected', 'growing', 'improve', 'world', 'protect', 'relatively', 'health', 'ensuring', 'education']","Bangladesh has been fortunate in being able to maintain a relatively low prevalence of HIV infection.

Solidarity works!,"How volunteers contribute to common goods
        	In Bangladesh, volunteering and mutual help are core values of society: around 16 million people annually decide to get involved in their community and volunteer",Miriam Ebner,2013-12-09 00:00:00,"In Bangladesh, volunteering and mutual help are core values of society: around 16 million people annually decide to get involved in their community and volunteer. Interestingly, volunteerism in Bangladesh is neither restricted to a specific sector nor to any age group. Old and young, men and women, they all dedicate their time to change society from within, playing an important role in transforming society.

Volunteerism permeates every aspect of society. Many volunteers strengthen education and health services in the public sector. Others volunteer in non-governmental organizations and contribute to the vibrant civil society of Bangladesh.

Particularly when it comes to disaster response, the Bangladeshi volunteer spirit has come out and amazed the world. Millions of people are engaged in organizations such as the Bangladesh Scouts, Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) or the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and play an essential role in early warning and disaster response.

During acute disasters, these volunteer-based organizations bridge the gap between the national government and local communities, through volunteers who travel to every village and inform the population about the magnitude and impact of cyclones. Volunteers assist in disaster response and have in the past evacuated people in need. Due to the efforts of these dedicated people, who are willing to risk their lives for others, the number of deaths caused by natural disasters has reduced significantly.

Their contribution to reducing the disaster vulnerability has been highlighted in the Disaster Management Act (DM Act 2012). The act emphasizes the role of community self-help organizations and local networks as the most effective resources for reducing risk vulnerability in communities and building adaptive capacity. As such, the DM Act 2012 proposes the establishment of a National Volunteer Corps to integrate volunteers into disaster management.

People’s motivation to be engaged in their community is also seen on a much smaller scale, for example, in schools and universities, where young people come together to form social clubs. These clubs aim to improve the life of disenfranchised groups in Bangladeshi society. They work towards promoting a more environmental friendly society or address other issues close to their heart.

In recent years, Bangladeshis have repeatedly proven that they are willing to volunteer for their community, regardless of financial incentives and other forms of recognition. The spontaneous urge to help each other became obvious following the complete collapse of the Rana Plaza building in April, when hundreds of people flocked to Savar to assist in rescue efforts.

Rickshaw-pullers, street vendors, university students and day laborers joined hands and worked tirelessly alongside the rescue operations teams of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, saving 2,500 people from the rubble.

Many different volunteer-based organizations offer people the opportunity to become active citizens and contribute to the development of their country.

The great contributions of volunteers towards development are annually celebrated on the 5th of December, International Volunteer Day. People around the world take time to pause and reflect on the tremendous contribution of civil society towards a more just world and volunteerism is specifically acknowledged as an important catalyst for social transformation.

The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme is the United Nations (UN) organization that contributes to peace and development through volunteerism worldwide. Since 1975, when the first international UN Volunteer started his assignment in Bangladesh, hundreds of UN Volunteers have supported different UN Agencies, government offices and civil society organizations. Every year passionate Bangladeshi volunteer abroad through UNV: they strengthen development programmes in countries like Sudan, Pakistan, Jamaica and Cote d’Ivoire.

On International Volunteer Day, we look at the achievements and celebrate volunteerism worldwide. This year, UNV wants to highlight the contributions of volunteers towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Bangladesh.

The eight MDGs, which range from halving extreme poverty to providing universal primary education, form a blueprint agreed by all world’s countries. Bangladesh is one of the top performing least developed countries and has achieved great successes, especially in the provision of education and the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality.

When talking about the MDGs and the many positive changes that occurred in the last decade in Bangladesh, we should not forget that it is people who change their world. To achieve these fundamental, but ambitious, development goals it requires much more than the involvement of governments and the international community. Of course policies play an important role, but in the end it is the knowledge, solidarity and creativity of millions of people that ensure the sustainability of our achievements.

Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger Sajal Roy

Since its establishment, Jege Otho Foundation fully relies on committed volunteers to plan and implement projects several days a week in schools, public spaces and the Jege Otho training center in Jessore. Sajal is the coordinator of PATSHALA, a game school where children and youths can come together to develop life skills in an informal setting. Many underprivileged kids from poor backgrounds come together and play football, cricket as well as discussing personal issues with the volunteers of Jege Otho. Sajal believes that through exercise and the experience of a safe space, they will develop mentally as well as physically. “Even though we do not directly reduce poverty by for example distributing food items, I think our work contributes in many ways to society” Sajal says.

Achieve Universal Primary Education Daina Chakma

As a national UN Volunteer, Daina Chakma has been supporting the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Facility of UNDP. As an Educational Assistant she worked with communities to strengthen community education project: many people joined the project and volunteered in the renovation and constructions of schools by providing local materials and free labor. Through the construction of these schools, access to education was improved in many remote communities and children do not have to walk long distances to go to school. Daina believes that education is key for people’s development and really enjoyed her volunteer service.

Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women Rowshon Akhter Urmee

Violence against women is a critical issue in Bangladesh. The youth-led Brave Men campaign aims at raising awareness on the issue by addressing concepts of masculinity. Urmee believes that gender stereotypes effect everyone and many boys are socialized in a context where violence against women – either verbal or physical – is accepted by society. Together with some friends she started to hold workshops on gender in boy’s schools. Their aim is to deconstruct the concept of bravery – which is often closely connected to violence against women – of teenage boys. The completely volunteer-based movement runs 2-month workshops in different schools and is happy to contribute to gender equality.

Reduce Child Mortality Minjoon Kim

Minjoon Kim decided to serve as an international UN Volunteer in 2012 and moved from Seoul to Dhaka. Minjoon is supporting UNICEF as an international UN Volunteer, is part of a team that gives trainings and support to hospitals and community workers on newborn care practices in Tangail district. When he arrived in Bangladesh, he was nervous: “Did I have the necessary skills? Would my experience as surgeon be enough?” were the questions he asked himself. After several field trips and discussions with colleagues, he grew confident. Now, he supports local NGOs in the monitoring process and conducts trainings with community help workers and implementing partners. He is part of a project that contributed to the globally acknowledged success in reducing under-5 mortality rate.

Improve Maternal Health Halima, Jesmin and Farida

During their nursing training, Halima, Jesmin and Farida witnessed the dangers of childbirth for women as well as newborns first hand. Since then, these three dedicated women have dedicated a lot of time and energy to improving maternal health and are part of the first group of certified midwives in Bangladesh. They met during a training course for midwifery and decided to create the Bangladesh Midwifery Society (BMS), an organization that advocates for their profession and offers trainings for nurses to become midwives. Next to their regular job as midwives and nurses, they are midwifery trainers and are board members of the BMS. The BMS offers a support structure for newly certified midwives and plays an important role in consolidating this new profession within the medical system in Bangladesh.

Combat HIV/Aids, Malaria and other Diseases Sharif Kaukab

Since the early 1990s, Sharif Kaukab has been serving as an international UN Volunteer in many different countries, such as Liberia, Nigeria and now Bangladesh. As the UN physician, he supports staff members and their families and plays an important role in the well-being of many people.

As an experienced doctor, he has seen the devastating effects of global public health issues such as HIV/Aids and malaria. These two illnesses cause many deaths worldwide and Sharif believes that one reason for this is lack of knowledge. Thus, it is important to spread information on these issues, for example through community talks. He believes that “an open and pro-active approach is essential to stop the spread of HIV: access to treatment and a non-discriminatory way of engaging with HIV-infected people build an important basis for preventative methods to be fruitful.”

Ensure Environmental Sustainability Sharmin Bulbul Lita

The Noazesh Knowledge Center (NKC) was founded in 2011 by the NGO WildTeam, which focuses on the protection of the Bengal Tiger and nature conservation. The NKC provides information on conservation and environmental issues to the public. 450 young members from different socio-economic backgrounds use the library or go on study trips to learn about environmental challenges in Bangladesh. Volunteers play a crucial role in the activities of the NKC: The center, which has only two paid staff members, relies on volunteers for activities such as data-collection, data entry, and support in organizing events, such as the Rikshaw challenge in February 2013, where 20 activists cycled from Teknaf to Chandpai to spread the message of tiger protection and environmental conservation. The latter is directly linked to reducing the effects of climate change and thus contributes to reducing the threats of natural disasters.

A Global Partnership for Development Mohammad Mamun Mia

When I enrolled in university, I started to volunteer at the United Nations Youth and Student Association of Bangladesh (UNYSAB), which was a game-changer for me. After volunteering in the organization for some years, I am now working as the President of UNYSAB. By joining UNYSAB or participating in the activities, students get the chance to work on a variety of social and global issues, such as the spread of HIV or the development of a global partnership. We introduce the United Nations to youth and encourage young people to inform themselves and participate in a global network created by different UN student groups all over the world. We promote volunteering because we see volunteerism as a means to develop leadership skills. Giving back to the community and advocating for the rights of groups at the margins of society are essential characteristics of good leadership.

What will happen after 2015?

The MDGs, which have formed and defined the global development discourse in the past years, have played an important role in focusing on core development issues. While we are getting closer to our deadline, people all over the world are discussing the next development framework.

The United Nations has taken up the challenge to ensure that the next development framework comes out of a transparent and open global debate, in which civil society organizations can share their vision for post-2015. Together with three youth-led organizations, namely JAAGO, Youth Power in Social Action (YPSA) and Jege Otho Foundation, UNV has organized and facilitated three youth consultations in Jessore, Chittagong and Dhaka, allowing youths to share their thoughts on the next development framework.

Over 80 young people representing 30 organizations came together and discussed issues close to their heart, like the lack of equality in access to information, education, employment, health facilities and basic rights. Their visionary thinking clearly showed that they are not only looking at their community, their region or their country, but rather aspire to a movement for global equality.

The results of the youth consultations will be published in January 2014 and are supplemental to the already published Report on the Post-2015 Development Agenda for Bangladesh.

The stories below show what change can occur because of an individual’s decision. They only exemplify the many ways in which volunteers contribute to positive and sustainable change in Bangladesh and many more stories could be told. We hope that the stories remind everyone that it is the small changes that really make a difference and change people’s lives.","['organizations', 'issues', 'works', 'bangladesh', 'community', 'volunteers', 'volunteer', 'development', 'society', 'important', 'solidarity', 'role']","Old and young, men and women, they all dedicate their time to change society from within, playing an important role in transforming society.

Dr Kamal: Contesting polls with Jamaat was a mistake,He says Jamaat-e-Islami has not been a part of Jaitya Oikya Front and never will be in the future,Md Nahian,2019-01-12 00:00:00,"Gono Forum President Dr Kamal Hossain addresses a press briefing after an extended meeting of the party’s central executive committee at its Motijheel office in Dhaka on Saturday, January 12, 2019 Focus Bangla

He says Jamaat-e-Islami has not been a part of Jaitya Oikya Front and never will be in the future

Jatiya Oikya Front chief Dr Kamal Hossain said it was a “mistake” on their part that Jamaat-e-Islami affiliated candidates contested the 11th general election under their platform’s banner.

“Whatever happened in the past involving Jamaat was an unintentional mistake. We did not know that they [Oikya Front member BNP] would give nominations to 22 Jamaat leaders,” he told reporters on Saturday, when asked whether he would be in Oikya Front if the BNP keeps Jamaat with it as an ally.

""What you [journalists] are saying about doing politics with Jamaat, we were not aware of it,"" he said.

“But let me make it clear: we will never conduct our political activities with Jamaat as a partner. Jamaat has not been a part of our platform in the recent past and never will be in the future,” Dr Kamal stressed.

Asked whether Oikya Front would request BNP to sever its ties with Jamaat, he said: “We may do that. We will discuss this Jamaat issue with BNP and demand a solution immediately, in order to keep Oikya Front intact and make it stronger.”

Dr Kamal, also the Gono Forum president, made the remarks while briefing the media after an extended meeting of Gono Forum’s central executive committee at its Motijheel office in Dhaka in the afternoon.

A total of 26 Jamaat leaders — 22 with BNP’s sheaf of paddy symbol, and four independently — contested the election. All of them, however, had withdrawn from the race midway, alleging vote rigging and irregularities by the ruling party.

""I have already publicly said that I was not aware of Jamaat candidates in the election. When I gave consent... I was not informed about Jamaat. I think you [journalists] can say it was a mistake,” he said.

Ruling Awami League had a landslide win in the December 30 general polls, amid the opposition’s allegations of widespread rigging and irregularities.

Earlier at Saturday’s press briefing, reading out a written statement, Gono Forum General Secretary Mostafa Mohsin Montu said that a stronger national unity should be forged in future, shunning the mistakes made during the hurried formation of Oikya Front.

He also announced that the party’s National Council will be held on March 23 and 24.

To strengthen the party, its central leaders will also visit different districts soon, Mostafa added.","['gono', 'leaders', 'bnp', 'mistake', 'contesting', 'dr', 'jamaat', 'general', 'forum', 'polls', 'oikya', 'kamal']","“Whatever happened in the past involving Jamaat was an unintentional mistake.

Elton John says Ireland abortion vote shows mindsets can change,"Elton John, on a visit to Ukraine to raise awareness about AIDS, said Ireland’s vote",Reuters,2018-05-29 00:00:00,"British musician Elton John talks on radio station air as he attends a charity event to support innovative HIV prevention and to raise awareness about AIDS in Kiev, Ukraine on Monday Reuters

Elton John, on a visit to Ukraine to raise awareness about AIDS, said Ireland’s vote to liberalize its abortion laws showed how mindsets can change.

The 71-year-old singer has travelled regularly to Ukraine and spoken out for gay rights in the eastern European country, including at an AIDS charity concert in Kiev during the Euro soccer championships in 2012.

“Believe me, I love this country. We will do everything we can to continue the fight against AIDS,” he said at an event organized by the Elena Pinchuk Foundation.

“It takes a long time for things to happen as I said,” he said. “Look what just happened in Ireland: the vote for abortion. Things change. People ... they change their mind. And with a younger generation coming up, they are different kind of people, and they’re our future.”

Voters in Ireland, a once deeply Catholic nation, on Friday backed a change to abortion laws by a landslide.

Ukrainian authorities have increased their support for gay rights since a pro-Western government took power following the Maidan protests in 2014. In 2015, a law was passed banning workplace discrimination against the LGBT community.

But critics say homophobic attitudes remain widespread.

Kiev was embroiled in gay rights row last year as it hosted the Eurovision Song Contest with a slogan to “Celebrate Diversity”. A plan to paint a Soviet-era monument in rainbow colors was resisted by hard-right groups.

The singer tried to adopt an HIV-positive baby in Ukraine 2009 but was refused permission by the authorities, who said prospective parents must be married and that Elton John’s civil partnership with David Furnish would not be recognized as such.

“We’ve made great progress but we still have a lot of work to do,” he said.","['ireland', 'change', 'rights', 'shows', 'vote', 'things', 'ukraine', 'singer', 'aids', 'john', 'support', 'mindsets', 'gay', 'elton', 'abortion']","“Look what just happened in Ireland: the vote for abortion.

Bangladeshi researchers develop advanced drug for Hepatitis B,"According to World Health Organisation (WHO), around 240 million people worldwide are living with chronic hepatitis B virus",BSS,2017-10-25 00:00:00,"Two Bangladeshi researchers have developed a breakthrough medicine for the patients infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV). The medicine is set to hit local drugstores early next year after getting approval from the drug administration. The medicine, invented by two Bangladeshi doctors Dr Mamun Al Mahtab and Dr Sheikh Mohammad Fazle Akbar, will be manufactured by a leading pharmaceutical company of the county. The company will release the drug at a cheaper price in all the major drugstores across the country. ""The therapeutic medicine named NASVAC may not be a magic drug, but it has shown a positive response rate of about 50% in case of patients infected with Hepatitis B and 100% in curing liver inflammation"", said Dr Mamun Al Mahtab, the key person for clinical trials of this drug. Dr Mahtab, an Associate Professor of Department of Hepatology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, carried out the required trials while Dr Sheikh Mohammad Fazle Akbar conducted the fundamental researches for developing the medicine. Dr Akbar, a liver expert, is now a professor at a university in Japan. He had been conducting the research to introduce a new hepatitis B treatment method in the last 25 years. The main theme of his research was to control Hepatitis B by developing disease resistant power in human body. Akbar conducted the initial clinical trial on Hepatitis B patients with approval of the health and education ministry of Japan after the successful experiment on transgenic mice. Subsequently, Dr Mahtab prepared a database of one thousand Hepatitis B patients in Bangladesh for further research. The first two trials of NASVAC were conducted in Bangladesh in 2009 on 18 chronic Hepatitis B patients. After getting the promising result from the two trials, the third trial was conducted in 2011 on 151 patients by dividing them in two groups. One group was treated by NASVAC while the other was given traditional Peg IFN. ""NASVAC showed more effectiveness over Peg IFN,"" said Dr Mahtab. He said the clinical trial in advanced stage was conducted in different countries in Asia, Latin America, Europe and Australia and in the Asia Pacific region. The doctor said the drug has already got approval from the authorities in Cuba, Belarus, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Angola. Currently, there is no drug available for full cure of HBV infection. Doctors, however, often go through conventional treatment to slowdown the progress of the virus infection so it could not create serious complications like cirrhosis and liver cancer. ""The conventional treatment also requires use of medicine for a long-time, leading patient to suffer from various side effects whereas NASVAC in clinical trial proves much effective in controlling virus,"" said Dr Mahtab. Apart from this, the doctor said NASVAC in clinical trial also showed much effective than conventional drugs in controlling not only HBV, but also other chronic infection. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), around 240 million people worldwide are living with chronic hepatitis B virus. Referring to a scientific study, Dr Mahtab said more than five crore people in Bangladesh are affected by Hepatitis B. Among them, over 8 million are infected with chronic Hepatitis B and at risk of deadly diseases like liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.","['nasvac', 'researchers', 'b', 'hepatitis', 'medicine', 'dr', 'develop', 'drug', 'liver', 'patients', 'trial', 'mahtab', 'advanced', 'bangladeshi']","Two Bangladeshi researchers have developed a breakthrough medicine for the patients infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).

Transitional wear 101,"The weather, recently has been too crazy to deal with!

Because it is so important! The theory of piling clothes, bearing in mind their weight and warmth, seems relatively easy as you are using what’s already in your wardrobe. However, if you do not put in much thought behind it, you might just end up looking helplessly buff. The girls can start infusing colours since spring is nearby. “Colourblocking” has been a popular option recently. Bright coloured shoes, dark fitted denim pants, a light-weight shirt underneath with a pastel jacket can be your day’s outfit. And on weekends, go with a pastel dress- we love the shades during the transitional period- a black leather jacket on top and dark leggings is a perfect mix of femininity and edge. The guys too, can look amazing. The trick is to know that you need an outfit that is lighter than your winter wear but warmer than summer. A white, fitter v-neck and a black leather jacket, teamed up with a dark coloured chino, and you’re set to make an impression on the girls.

The “cooler-warm” clothes After being bundled up in your favourite jacket during the winter days, light-weight materials are the way to go during the transitional climate. Hipster jackets, cardigans and half sleeved sweaters are welcome.

What are you willing to compromise?,"Make no mistake, the elections on January 5 are half-baked only because of one party: the BNP
        	Recent weeks have seen people speaking about compromise, about how the two parties and two leaders are being intransigent",Sajeeb Wazed,2013-12-28 00:00:00,"Recent weeks have seen people speaking about compromise, about how the two parties and two leaders are being intransigent. The fact that the Awami League has repeatedly offered the BNP multiple compromises is conveniently disregarded.

The prime minister has personally invited the leader of the opposition to unconditional talks, and offered numerous solutions such as the all-party interim government. We have offered them any ministry in this interim government, including the Home Ministry.

Even our offer to hold the 11th parliamentary elections early is a compromise to ensure that on January 25, we do not have an unconstitutional government. Yet, at every step that Awami League has made a constructive gesture, BNP has refused to talk and responded with ever-increasing violence.

It is easy to hypothesise on the benefits of compromise, and how this political impasse is the result of stubborn parties and stubborn leaders. But let us not forget that we are in this situation because of the demands of the people.

Many of the same people who today are demanding that we compromise with the BNP at all cost were for the past five years demanding that we try war criminals and ban Jamaat. Did anyone consider the consequences of those actions? Jamaat was not going to disappear quietly. The BNP-Jamaat alliance would not sit idly by while war criminals went to the gallows.

We need to look at what is at stake, because compromise for compromise’s sake is as ill-conceived as it is damaging. There are certain things on which we will not compromise. We will not compromise our promise to the people to bring the war criminals to justice. We will not shy away from fighting for a secular and democratic Bangladesh. Had Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down as BNP demanded, Quader Molla would not have been hanged. Let there be no doubt, no one else would have had the courage and strength to stand up to the international pressure.

We certainly do not want violence, but let us take a historical perspective. In our liberation movement, we did not set out demanding independence, and we did not declare war. All we wanted was the right to form a democratic government after our victory in the national elections. There were protracted negotiations between Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib, Yahya Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto both publicly and in secret.

Yet, no agreement could be reached, because Yahya Khan was unwilling to compromise. Instead, he chose to try and crush our demands for autonomy with force. The Pakistani Army attacked first, before Bangabandhu declared independence on the night of March 26. Should Bangabandhu have compromised and given up on our rights in order to avoid war?

BNP has, indeed, been consistent in their actions and demands. They have consistently shown their complete lack of democratic intent and disregard for the peoples’ democratic right to vote. BNP has repeatedly tried to rig elections every time it has been in power.

Magura and Dhaka-10 by-elections come to mind. They rigged the 1996 national elections even though they were running unopposed. In 2006, they rewrote the voters’ list with 14m more voters than the population of voting age.

Even having a caretaker government was no protection, as they manipulated the caretaker government itself in attempting to rig the elections, leading to a military takeover.

Make no mistake, the elections on January 5 are half-baked only because of one party: the BNP. It is through their unpatriotic alliance with Jamaat and their continuing arson and bomb attacks on innocent civilians that they have denied the people the elections they deserve. Yes, these elections are not ideal but that is a topic in itself. The people will still get a free and fair election. We should not fool ourselves into thinking that this wave of unjustifiable violence that BNP-Jamaat has unleashed is about elections. It is about saving the war criminals.

Even if we were to somehow get BNP to participate in elections, as long as the war crimes trials are ongoing, BNP-Jamaat will continue their violence. The only compromise which will stop the violence is the release of the war criminals. BNP and Jamaat have declared war on the ordinary citizens of Bangladesh.

Under the pretence of fighting for elections they are terrorising the people to save war criminals. If the demand is to bring the BNP to the elections and stop the violence at all costs, are you willing to pay the price?

We are not willing to pay this price because it compromises our liberation and the very spirit that makes us a nation. Such a compromise would be a betrayal of the three million who gave their lives to give us this democracy and freedom.

No, we have attempted to compromise as much as possible and, just as in 1971, our compromises have been met with violence. We did not ask for this fight, but this fight was thrust upon us. Now it is time to stand our ground and fight back. It’s time for the people to reclaim the spirit of 1971 and fight these anti-liberation forces.","['bnp', 'fight', 'jamaat', 'violence', 'criminals', 'elections', 'democratic', 'war', 'compromise', 'willing', 'compromises']","Recent weeks have seen people speaking about compromise, about how the two parties and two leaders are being intransigent.

City fire leaves thousands homeless,"Some 15 slum dwellers in the capital’s Hazaribagh were also injured in the fire

Some 15 slum dwellers in the capital’s Hazaribagh were also injured in the fire. The Hajaribagh fire originated at Boubazar slum near Balurmath around 10pm. Nine units of firefighters in association with locals and slum dwellers put out the flame with a joint effort of two hours.

However, the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained as one of the slum dwellers said the fire originated from a mosquito coil while another gave the version that the fire originated from a short circuit.

Locals and witnesses said around 2,000 people had been residing in the slum and almost everything of the slum housings had been burnt to ashes.

Most of the slum dwellers were away on the occasion of Eid.

Major Mahbubur Rahman, director (operation) of Fire Service and Civil Defence, said around 400 shanties were burnt although the dwellers claimed that the number was around 500.

Witnesses said the fire engulfed the entire slum within moments before the firefighters rushed to the spot. Almost all shanties were made of wood and tins.

Meanwhile, another fire in the capital’s Islambagh left at least four plastic storehouses burnt. According to fire officials, the flame originated around 11:30am and seven units of firefighters doused it with their frantic efforts of around one hour.

Jol Jatra,"Giving back, one photograph at a timeAs October approached, so did Pamela Ketcher's birthday",N Anita Amreen,2015-11-15 00:00:00,"As October approached, so did Pamela Ketcher's birthday. A consultant for UNAIDS and a public health worker who's been in Bangladesh for a little over a year, her work has spanned everything from raising awareness for burning issues such as HIV as well as organising events that help social causes that are close to her heart. With October 17 marking both her birthday as well as the UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, this year, Ketcher had a different plan in mind.

She decided to do something a tad unorthodox – something that didn't involve the usual birthday celebration or gift exchange. An avid photographer with a passion for it, Ketcher always had a humble dream to one day hold her very own exhibition. With both her birthday and the UN day for Eradication of Poverty coincidentally falling on the same day, she decided to combine both her passion and her desire to give back to a cause by holding her very first exhibition.

Jol Jatra, a single day exhibition held at Tea Stall on November 11, had a small, but warm display of 20 photographs taken by Pamela herself, with all proceeds from the exhibition to be donated to Orunodoyer Torun Dol (OTD), a non-profit youth organisation that works relentlessly to raise awareness for social causes as well as work for the underprivileged – a cause she feels very close to.

“This exhibition is a small way for me to give back. To me it's not important to exchange gifts or celebrate my birthday this year. I wanted to do something that actually meant something to me and that's where I got the idea to hold Jol Jatra and give the proceeds to OTD.”

Despite having a range of large, and more well known organisations she could donate to, she chose to go for OTD after a serendipitous meeting with Shahidul Islam Babu, president of OTD, just two weeks prior to the exhibition.

“October was a busy month for me but I had this exhibition at the back of my mind. Interestingly, Babu turned up one day at my office and I felt like my ideas just clicked into place. His work surrounds raising awareness on social issues, public health and also working for underprivileged children – areas that I have sort of been working with. When I met him and saw the work he has put into his organisation, building it from scratch, I knew I wanted the proceeds to go OTD,” she explained.

Starting out as a group of five, OTD began it's journey in 2010, with Babu spearheading the organisation's growth one small donation at a time. Losing his parents at an early age, Babu grew up in a shabby area in Mohammadpur, only being able to study till grade four. “I remember seeing a newspaper headline that read 'Mohammadpur - a drug addicts den.' and felt tired of the misconception people had about today's youth. Soon after, I was taking a long walk one night that winter, and I noticed a woman – shriveled and cold, shivering with no blanket to shield her,” he recalled. Inspired by these two incidents, he decided to buckle up and really try to do something about. That year they were able to donate and help only three women, raising money from everyone from garment's workers to security guards who donated Tk30-Tk50 per month, a measly amount, but one that worked to humbly forward a greater cause.

“We began with five people. Today our organisation stands at 135 workers and sometimes even I'm astounded at how far we've gone. I know it isn't much in the grand scale of things, but I know we are trying our best.”

The photographs are priced between Tk2,500 to Tk3,000, depending on the size and type of photograph. With an underlying “river,” theme, each photo exhibits Pamela's excursions over the past year as she documents her time through Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar.

Her favourite, she says, is a top shot of long canoes with colourful seats and umbrellas pointing upwards. “It's a very colourful photo and I love colours. I call this photo 'up,' and think it's a very bright photo that just looks very happy to me,” Ketcher described.

Second in line is an almost abstract shot of a view between two boats, taken from the docks on her way to Kuakata. “When you look at this you can't really tell exactly what it is, until you look closely. It's got a very upward composition and that's what I like best,” she explained. Another, is a photograph of Banani lake, still and calm, a boat docked in the bottom with a man resting peacefully on the boat. “There was span of time when there were many hartals and I had to spend a lot of time at home. I looked out from my balcony and noticed this man, just relaxing on his boat, with the cityscape reflected in the water,” Pamela explained.

With this just being her debut exhibition, she hopes she can perhaps hold a few more. With the exhibition already underway and funds being raised, she hopes she can continue campaigning for their cause, working to help HIV cases, raise awareness on child marriage and even work for an anti-tobacco campaign. “Anything that relates to trying to minimise harm, be it for a small population or even the population at large, is something I would like to continue campaigning for,” she concluded.

Meanwhile, Babu will take the proceeds from the exhibition to fund winter clothing to be distributed among the very needy in the far north of the country. Afterwards, with the help and support of similar people and organisations, he hopes to stage a play where street children act out their stories, giving the world a glimpse into their worlds.","['day', 'babu', 'exhibition', 'proceeds', 'awareness', 'help', 'birthday', 'small', 'jol', 'jatra', 'work', 'otd']","She decided to do something a tad unorthodox – something that didn't involve the usual birthday celebration or gift exchange.
An avid photographer with a passion for it, Ketcher always had a humble dream to one day hold her very own exhibition.
“October was a busy month for me but I had this exhibition at the back of my mind.
Interestingly, Babu turned up one day at my office and I felt like my ideas just clicked into place.
His work surrounds raising awareness on social issues, public health and also working for underprivileged children – areas that I have sort of been working with."
Nobody monitors illegal blood centres,"If someone takes a stroll on the footpath opposite the Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital in Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, he will notice the phrase “blood bank” on almost every other signboard",Mohammad Jamil Khan,2015-06-13 00:00:00,"If someone takes a stroll on the footpath opposite the Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital in Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, he will notice the phrase “blood bank” on almost every other signboard.

There are scores of places in the area who “provide” blood transfusion and preservation services in the locality that is dominated by hospitals and clinics.

Hundreds of people come to these hospitals everyday and blood-related services is one of the commonest things they need.

But for a layman, who does not have medical education, there is nothing that can tell whether these blood banks have the appropriate instruments and facilities to screen out lethal germs such as HIV and Hepatitis B from a blood sample.

On government’s papers, there are only 290 licensed blood transfusion centres (BTCs) in the country. But unofficial data shows that the number of unlicensed BTCs is not less than 1,500.

The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) is the licensing authority but it has no monitoring responsibilities. In fact, there is no designated authority for making sure that nobody provides blood-related services without proper licenses.

Taking advantage of this loophole, thousands of blood transfusion centres are providing unsolicited services to millions of patients.

Experts say that, in most cases, the emergency patients become victims as most often blood have to be managed for them in the shortest of notices.

At present, out of the 800,000 bags of blood required in the country every year, only half comes from licensed blood banks, sources said.

The Society for Safe Blood Transfusion estimates that over 80% of the blood transfusions are unsafe as they remain unscreened.

According to the Safe Blood Transfusion Act 2002, all blood and blood products must be tested for five transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) – Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, syphilis, malaria and HIV. The act also says that a blood bank must recruit doctors, nurses and technicians to conduct the tests.

However, the Dhaka Tribune has learned that at most of these unlicensed blood banks, the tests are conducted by people without any relevant formal training.

Some secret blood banks in Old Dhaka, Mohammadpur and Shyamoli areas are run by gangs comprising two or three nurses and assistants who work at different hospitals.

They collect blood from drug addicts and homeless people who sell blood on a regular basis, and store it carelessly in unhygienic conditions. When any poor patient needs blood, they offer these secretly. Such banks do not have any government approval to operate.

An employee of one such blood centre in Dhaka’s Mohammadpur told this correspondent: “Patients come to us when there is an emergency. They do not bother about screening.”

He however claimed that all the blood transfusion centres in that area have proper equipment for running the blood tests.

In Dhaka’s Mohakhali area, this correspondent found a pathology centre that is set up in just two rooms – one is the reception and the other has the laboratory. This centre provides blood transfusion services as well.

Seeking anonymity, an employee of a licensed blood centre from the same locality told the Dhaka Tribune that blood screening equipment are big machines and would need several rooms.

The license fee for setting up a pathology centre is only Tk5,000 compared to the Tk1 lakh fee for a full-fledged blood transfusion centre and bank.

“That is why, many people acquire the pathology license and run blood transfusion services,” said Murad Sultan, national professional officer of the World Health Organisation (WHO).

“It is very alarming that a large number of unregulated blood banks, including many in private hospitals and clinics, are delivering blood to patients without proper screening, posing serious health risks to patients,” said Prof Dr Ashadul Islam from the Transfusion Department of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU).

“Most of the unregulated blood banks hire a house close to public hospitals and start operating the business from there. The government does not care about monitoring the blood banks, who are involved with purchasing blood from professionals and delivering the unscreened blood to patients,” Prof Ashadul told the Dhaka Tribune.

The government is planning to set up a National Blood Centre in Mohakhali, but its construction work is yet to begin.

“The government has allocated Tk8 crore recently for the building. It will also form a central blood centre with a central database. The centre will monitor the blood banks and impart necessary training on related officials,” said Ashadul, who is also the secretary of the National Expert Council for Safe Blood Transfusion.

When contacted, State Minister for Health Zahid Malik told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday: “There is a law in this regard. There are government directives as well. We are also very serious. We are continuing action against those who do not have proper blood storing facilities or instruments. Still, despite all our efforts, one or two miss our radar. But we will most definitely take action against them as well.”","['services', 'proper', 'hospitals', 'told', 'transfusion', 'blood', 'centre', 'banks', 'centres', 'patients', 'monitors', 'illegal', 'dhaka']","On government’s papers, there are only 290 licensed blood transfusion centres (BTCs) in the country.

The areas for greater attention also include employment for women, increase in the presence of skilled health professionals at delivery, increase in correct and comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS, increase in forest coverage and ICT penetration, says the “Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), Bangladesh Progress Report 2012” released Sunday.

General Economics Division (GED) of the Planning Commission launched the report at a function held in the city, reports UNB.

Planning Minister AK Khandker spoke as the chief guest while Finance Minister AMA Muhith, Food Minister M Abdur Razzaque, State Minister for Primary and Mass Education Md Motahar Hossain and UN Resident Coordinator Neal Walker also spoke.

GED member of the Planning Commission Dr Shamsul Alam presided. He highlighted the features of the report through a power-point presentation.

Out of the eight MDGs, Bangladesh has achieved the major targets of Goal-1, 3, 4 and 6 including the targets of poverty gap ratio, attaining gender parity at primary and secondary levels of education, under-five mortality rate reduction, prevention of malaria, containing HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs, children under-five sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, and detection and cure rate of TB under DOTS.

Out of 60 indicators, 34 have specific targets, against which Bangladesh already met the target in 9 indicators, 11 indicators are on track and expected to be achieved by 2015.

With less than 1,000 days remaining to the terminal year (2015) of MDGs, Bangladesh sent its proposal on Post-2015 Development Agenda to the United Nations on June 6 comprising 11 goals along with 58 targets with corresponding 241 measurable indicators in P2015DA. The implementation period for P2015DA has been proposed for 2016-2030.

Muhith said despite the country’s achievements in development indicators, still there are problems in energy security, in completion rates and standards in education, very serious problem in values as it is important in corruption and governance issues, access to technology, population pressure and degradation of environment.

Noting that there is no shortage of food in Bangladesh, Abdur Razzaque said the big challenge that Bangladesh has to face in the future is malnourishment.

Expressing his disappointment that except for some Scandinavian countries, no developed countries have come up with their commitments for helping the LDCs to meet the MDGs.

Motahar Hossain hoped that by 2015, it would be possible to enroll 95% students in primary terminal examinations. Neal Walker observed that Bangladesh made remarkable progress towards the MDGs, but this was not the time to be complacent rather to work with full spirit to attain the rest of the targets.

The report states that Bangladesh had made remarkable progress in the areas of poverty reduction, reducing the prevalence of underweight children, increasing enrolment at primary schools, lowering the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate, improving immunisation coverage and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases.

It said the current status of Bangladesh’s development indicates that priority needs to be given to several critical areas such as increasing productive capacity, enhancing access to knowledge and technology, strengthening trade, human and social development, improving governance and institutional capacity, increasing resilience to economic and natural shocks, mitigating climate change impacts and enhancing the volume and quality of resource support.","['report', 'areas', 'looks', 'minister', 'half', 'mdgs', 'unmet', 'targets', 'primary', 'goals', 'bangladesh', 'development', 'rate', 'indicators']","Although Bangladesh has achieved some Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), there are some other areas including hunger and poverty reduction, employment generation, primary school completion rate and adult literacy rate that need greater attention.

Police authorities at the meeting did not refute the MPs allegations but assured the watchdog that they would investigate the activities of the law enforcement agencies and take necessary action.

Jatiya Party MP and committee member Mujibul Haque raised two issues at the meeting.

“You file cases against thousands of unidentified people for violence committed by mobs. Are all people violent? Hardly 20-30 people take part in any violence,” Haque told the inspector general of police. He said the police could not issue charge sheets against thousands of people.

“Police use it as a tool of extortion. Anyone declining to give money faces charges,” said the MP. “You must stop this.”

Other members at the meeting agreed with him.

“The civil units of the police have been involved in extortion. Please close down these units; the common people are fed up with such civil units set up at every police station,” said Haque.

He said the recent incident of extortion by the civil unit of police in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar was an example of the civil unit taking money illegally from the common people.

Police personnel arrested some members of the civil unit of the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar thana collecting money from a rickshaw puller.

The authorities will review the allegations and suggestions and take action against the persons responsible, said the inspector general.

A public health risk,"While the health ministry has taken measures to prevent such an incident, the possibility of an epidemic urges us to be cautious, and to take whatever preventive steps necessary",Tribune Editorial,2017-12-01 00:00:00,"Bangladesh has done a tremendous job of providing a safe haven for the Rohingya people, who have fled persecution on an unimaginable scale at the hands of the Myanmar government.

However, we must not ignore the health risks that have arisen as a result.

Because the Rohingya are returning from the very depths of squalour, it only makes sense that, due to their extraordinarily deplorable living conditions, many refugees brought with them various diseases.

As a result, what the government must ensure is that these diseases are contained, and do not spread into Bangladesh’s general populace.

Recent reports have suggested that there is a significant number amongst the Rohingya currently carrying the HIV/AIDS virus. By latest estimates, this number could be in the thousands.

What is scary is that only 83 people have been identified carrying the virus so far, suggesting that most people are not even aware of the fact.

This presents a dangerous situation, and a potential medical disaster.

While the health ministry has taken measures to prevent such an incident, the possibility of an epidemic urges us to be cautious, and to take whatever preventive steps necessary.

With Myanmar showing no clear signs of repatriation, for the moment, we must see the Rohingya as a permanent fixture of our nation’s consciousness.

As such, we must ensure that they receive the medical treatment necessary.

However, the issue of AIDS is not specific to the Rohingya population alone, as experts have suggested that the Bangladeshi population was also prone to the disease, with two-thirds of those affected completely unaware.

Improve earthquake response capability before disaster strikes,The government needs to prioritise projects to improve the capability of emergency services to deal with the risk of earthquakes hitting the country,Tribune Editorial,2016-01-16 00:00:00,"The government needs to prioritise projects to improve the capability of emergency services to deal with the risk of earthquakes hitting the country.

After 2015’s severe earthquake in Nepal jolted Bangladesh last April, fire services in Dhaka began keeping life-saving equipment outside their own buildings, because they were deemed at risk of collapse from major tremors.

While some investment is now being made in new buildings, the pace of efforts to improve emergency services needs to be urgently sped up.

Nationally, there is still only around one fully trained fire-fighter and rescuer for every 30,000 people. The fire service also remains deeply under-resourced with the entire capital city and Dhaka division having only four fully-equipped rescuer-vans for its 25 million people.

Even more worrying, there is little evidence of co-ordination and training to improve preparedness.

Severe doubts exists, for example, about the ability of utility providers and transport services to keep power, gas, water supplies, and roads functioning to enable help to be provided to victims.

The threat level is increased by the large number of poorly constructed buildings prevalent in the country. These need to be modified as a matter of urgency as part of efforts to ensure all buildings are constructed to be as earthquake resistant as possible.

More investment also needs to be made in equipment, training, and planning to ensure more back-ups are available to keep rescuer and medical services running in the event of disasters.

The government should apply lessons learned in countries such as Japan on ways to prepare for earthquakes, and to build up public awareness and safety precautions.

The initiative is a part of the government’s policy to empower women

As part of the government’s policy to empower women, each of 1.04 million distressed and destitute women across the country are to get 30kg of nutritious rice per month under the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program.

“We are providing skill development training to extreme poor women across the country,” Secretary of Women and Children Affairs Ministry, Kamrun Nahar, said on Thursday.

She said the ministry had distributed 30 kg nutritious rice to each of 2.5m distressed women across the country for two years from 2014-15 to June 2018 financial year.

According to the ministry’s information, the government is providing maternity allowance to 7,00,000 poor mothers under a three-year program, and each month the mother gets a Tk800 allowance.

Under the program, the government provides 30kg of packaged food (rice) and training services (training, savings, and loans) to extreme poor women.

“We are disbursing a maternity allowance to each beneficiary through the “Government to Person” system, and bank accounts, as part of the digital Bangladesh concept,” the secretary said.

The ministry information said that 250,000 beneficiary mothers are getting T800 per month in financial year 2018-19, while 280,350 beneficiary mothers received Tk500 each month from 2014-15 to June 2018, under the “Working Lactating Mother Assistance Fund Program,” across the country.

The program is being implemented in all city corporations, district and upazila headquarters, and municipalities.

Apart from this, the government is imparting training on individual health and cleanliness, maternal and child health, women empowerment, disaster and risk management, and HIV and AIDS, the ministry sources said.

Secretary Nahar said: “The present government extended the VGD, maternity allowance for poor mothers, and the working lactating mother assistance fund program to bring the extreme poor within sustainable development.”

The government is also providing income generating training to distressed and destitute women to make them self-reliant, including training in raising local chickens and ducks, local cows and goats, and cultivating vegetables.","['destitute', 'nutritious', 'women', 'rice', '104m', 'training', 'ministry', 'poor', 'providing', 'mother', 'month', 'mothers', '30kg', 'program']","Keeping women down helps no one BIGSTOCKThe initiative is a part of the government’s policy to empower womenAs part of the government’s policy to empower women, each of 1.04 million distressed and destitute women across the country are to get 30kg of nutritious rice per month under the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program.

UN panel probes N Korean abductions of Japanese,"Japanese families talk about the pain experienced when their loved ones vanished
        	A UN team probing North Korea's human rights record Thursday heard of the pain experienced by Japanese families when their loved ones vanished, abducted to train Pyongyang's spies",AFP,2013-08-29 00:00:00,"A UN team probing North Korea's human rights record Thursday heard of the pain experienced by Japanese families when their loved ones vanished, abducted to train Pyongyang's spies.

The three-member Commission of Inquiry chaired by retired Australian judge Michael Kirby met the parents of Megumi Yokota, who has become an iconic figure in Japan after her kidnapping by North Korean agents in 1977 when she was 13.

“Megumi just disappeared like a puff of smoke, and we had no idea where she had gone,” said her 77-year-old mother Sakie Yokota. “It was such a tormenting period.”

The three commission members also met families of others who were abducted – Keiko Arimoto and Yaeko Taguchi, both in their early 20s when they were kidnapped – among 17 people whom the Japanese government has officially recognised as having been taken to North Korea.

The commission – the first UN expert panel to officially examine North Korea's rights record –spent five days in Seoul collecting harrowing testimony of rights abuses in the isolated state.

Megumi's father Shigeru, 80, expressed hope that the commission would make progress on an issue that provides the backdrop to all exchanges between Tokyo and Pyongyang, and one that generates a visceral nationwide response.

Pyongyang admitted in 2002 its agents had snatched young Japanese in what Tokyo said was an operation to train spies in Japanese language and customs.

Journalist Kenji Ishidaka said at the public hearing Thursday that Pyongyang agents also abducted Japanese nationals to steal their identity and obtain Japanese passports.

Following a summit between then-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and Kim Jong-Il, the late North Korean leader, five of those who were taken were allowed to return to Japan. Their Korea-born offspring were allowed to come to Japan later.

But suspicions persist in Japan that the isolated state has not come clean about the scope of its abductions and the issue colours all of Tokyo's dealings on North Korea.

The North, which strongly denies allegations of rights abuses, has refused to recognise the commission and barred it from visiting.

Kirby has repeatedly appealed to North Korea to grant his team access.","['abducted', 'n', 'abductions', 'rights', 'japan', 'yokota', 'train', 'panel', 'north', 'tokyo', 'korean', 'probes', 'commission', 'agents', 'japanese']","A UN team probing North Korea's human rights record Thursday heard of the pain experienced by Japanese families when their loved ones vanished, abducted to train Pyongyang's spies.

Oxfam America, Health Gap, Knowledge Ecology International, Public Citizen, Union for Affordable Cancer Treatment and Young Professionals Chronic Disease Network have sent a letter to Obama this week to consider the issue for the LDCs.

“We strongly urge the US to take immediate steps to express its full and unconditional support for the LDC Group’s request for a pharmaceutical transition period for as long as they remain LDCs,” the letter said.

The NGOs said in the letter that they believed the LDCs’ request for a pharmaceutical transition period for as long as they remain as LDCs will receive unconditional support from WTO members.

The European Union has publicly supported the LDCs’ request and the UN and international agencies including WHO, UNITAID, UNAIDS and UNDP, suppliers of generic medicines to LDCs, and civil society organisations from across the world have unequivocally supported the LDCs’ request, it said.

“We fail to understand why the US alone continues to oppose LDCs’ demand – a legally sound and justified request for a pharmaceutical transition period for as long as they remain LDCs,” the letter said.

LDCs are the most vulnerable and poorest segment of the international community.

According to the United Nations, more than 70% of the LDC population lives on less than $2 per day and an estimated 252 million people live in hunger.

World Bank data from 2014 reports that only 36% of the least developed countries have access to improved sanitation facilities while 68% have access to improved drinking water source.

As of 2012, two thirds of people in LDCs lacked access to electricity.

In 2014, Gross National Income per capita for LDCs was $915 compared to $55,200 for the United States.

In 2001, the Doha Declaration on The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public health which exempted LDCs from pharmaceutical product patenting until January 1, 2016, had a hugely positive impact in improving access to affordable treatment.

It enabled LDC governments, donors and the international community to treat more HIV/AIDs patients. However the treatment gap continues to be massive, as 63% of the 10.7 million people living with HIV in LDCs do not have access to antiretroviral (ARV).

Non-communicable disease is another growing challenge for LDCs as its prevalence increases and treatments are simply unaffordable, especially as most of the medical expenses in LDCs are borne “out-of-pocket.”","['transition', 'international', 'access', 'pharma', 'letter', 'remain', 'obama', 'period', 'ngos', 'request', 'ldcs', 'long', 'urge', 'pharmaceutical', 'extend']","Six international non-government organisations have urged US President Barack Obama to extend the pharmaceutical transition period for the least developed countries.

India keep Champions Trophy squad on hold,The other seven nations have named their squads but India are unlikely to face any sanction from the International Cricket Council (ICC) under the rules of the 50-over tournament,AFP,2017-04-27 00:00:00,"India are refusing to unveil their squad for the Champions Trophy amid speculation they might pull out because of a row with the sport's governing body over revenue sharing. The powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has already missed the agreed April 25 deadline for naming their squad for the eight-nation event beginning in England and Wales on June 1. The other seven nations have named their squads but India are unlikely to face any sanction from the International Cricket Council (ICC) under the rules of the 50-over tournament. India's reluctance stems from their long-running opposition to changes in the financial and governance structure of the ICC which would reduce their influence and earnings along with the other members of the so-called ""big three"" Australia and England. The ICC board meeting in Dubai on Wednesday voted in favour of the new financial model despite the BCCI -- the world's richest cricket board -- voting against. The board also voted in favour of a new constitution which will now be put before the ICC Full Council for approval. The dispute has raised speculation in India that the cricket-mad nation could pull out the 50-over Champions Trophy tournament, an event they won in 2013, an option the BCCI was not ruling out. ""It is too early to make predictions since the event is more than a month away, but nothing can be ruled out. Let's wait and watch,"" a BCCI board official told AFP Thursday on condition of anonymity.

Humanity scores another goal,"A better world, one goal at a timeThe global goals for 2030 were agreed upon and signed by the 193 leaders of the world in New York recently",Nibir Mostafa Khan,2015-10-06 00:00:00,"The global goals for 2030 were agreed upon and signed by the 193 leaders of the world in New York recently. The goals are a group of objectives set in order to make Earth a better place than it is now. There is no doubt that this is going to be a land-mark event in the years to come, it might even be marked as the event that gave birth to a new world, thinking optimistically of course.

Before this, in 1990, a similar plan was devised, with 2015 being set as the target. These were called the Millennium Development Goals. Let’s take a look at how that turned out for us, and what we have to repeat again for 2030, what’s new this time, and if there is any hope for making this a better world by 2030.

The first goal of the MDGs was to cut in half the number of people living in extreme poverty and hunger. Surprisingly, this goal was achieved, even though it was partial. The number of people going hungry in 2015, compared to 1990, is not half, but it’s close to being so. But on the other hand, in 1990, about 1.9 billion people lived on less than $1.25 a day. In 2015, that number is 900 million.

The next goal was to achieve universal primary education. This was not accomplished, but we were awfully close in achieving it. 90% of children go to school in the developing world, and 91% of all young people in the world are now literate, compared to 83% in 1990.

The third objective was to establish gender equality all over the world. This has not gone according to plan, but there has been significant development in this matter, especially in terms of education. In 1990, South Asian schools had 75 girls for every 100 boys. Those figures are now 103 and 100 respectively.

The aim which came after that was reducing childhood mortality by 66% in 25 years. This was not met unfortunately, but we were able to reduce the occurrence of childhood deaths by more than 50%. Meanwhile, maternal mortality rate fell by approximately 75% in 25 years.

The sixth objective was to halt and begin the reversal of the effects of HIV and malaria. While some big strides have been made in terms of battling and treating HIV, humanity has tackled malaria far better -- 20% fewer deaths occur in the world today due to malaria than it did in 1990.

The seventh goal was to ensure environmental sustainability. Let us not pretend that this has gone the way we had planned. The Earth is 46 billion years old. Scaling to 46 years, humans have been on the planet for four hours, and the industrial revolution began 1 minute ago. In this time, we have destroyed more than 50% of all the Earth’s forests. This is not the definition of sustainability. The last aim of the MDGs was to establish a global partnership to achieve these goals. I guess it’s safe to say that this goal has been fulfilled.

The main goal of the MDGs, in my opinion, was to aim for the moon, so that even if we miss, we’ll end up amongst the stars anyway. While it’s true that not all the goals of the MDGs have been fulfilled, the progress that we have made is extraordinary. I don’t think we even expected this much progress all the way back in 1990.

But it is now 2015, and it is time for us to set for ourselves a new set of goals, which has been done. This time we should seek to fulfill them perfectly, and complete the goals that we missed in 2015 as well.

We should be able to do this, because we are in a better position than our predecessors, and we have better resources and a better understanding of the problems at hand, having to deal with them longer. And I think the current generation should take up the challenge because, just as Native Americans have always said, we have merely borrowed the world from our children, we have not inherited it from our parents.

So, what are these new global goals? There are 17 of them in total, and the three main ones are ending extreme poverty, fighting inequality and injustice, and finally doing something about our rapidly changing climate.

Poverty, hunger, inequality, and climate have all made reappearances in the list, but there are a few problems which have actually been solved, and the ones that haven’t been solved were very close to being solved. So, with the success that past goals have had, we can be optimistic and we can get to work. The first thing we must do is spread awareness about these ideas as widely as we can, so that everyone knows about them.

There are many awareness activities on the global goals website which anyone can help with. These include dizzy goals, goal selfie, championing a goal by writing the number on one’s body, and there are even posters which we can print. Let us not be the generation of by-standers, let us be the first generation to become true global citizens, because these are our problems, and we have to solve them. No one else is going to. So, humanity, let’s get to work! We have goals to score!","['mdgs', 'goals', 'goal', '1990', 'better', 'world', 'humanity', 'set', 'scores', '2015', 'number', 'global']","The global goals for 2030 were agreed upon and signed by the 193 leaders of the world in New York recently.

Decriminalization of drug use: A better option for Bangladesh?,"Decriminalization does not necessarily mean legalization, but rather removes criminal penalties for use or possession either by law (de jure) or by practice (de facto)",Kamrul Hasan,2018-04-03 00:00:00,"What is drug decriminalization?

Will decriminalization help?

Portugal- a success story

Prevention and attenuation of drug addiction has long been a global concern. The proposal to decriminalize drug addiction gained momentum following the establishment of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. It is an international treaty for prohibiting production and supply of specific drugs and of drugs with similar effects, except under license for specific purposes. The think-tanks behind this approach had pointed out that repressive efforts directed at the consumers of illegal drugs impede public health measures to reduce HIV/AIDS, overdose fatalities and other harmful consequences of narcotics use. Three major treaties have been introduced to help control the global narcotics issue- the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, which was amended by the 1972 Protocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988. The United Nations office on Drugs and Crimes, the Global Commission on Drug Policy, WHO, the European Monitoring centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and many other research and advocacy organizations are working across the globe for promotion and implementation of the above-mentioned strategy. This approach provides the authorities with a new method of dealing with drug abuse. Adopting such a strategy could lessen the number of people addicted to drugs, and help reduce the chances of further harm to addicts who are undergoing punishment or rehabilitation. A report by The Global Commission on Drug Policy (2011) recommended that criminalization, marginalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but do no harm to others, should come to an end. Many countries around the world have already decriminalized drug use and possession in various ways.Drug decriminalization is the process for reduced control and penalties compared to existing drug laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization usually support the use of fines or other punishments to replace prison terms. This approach often proposes systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of harm reduction. Decriminalization supports a structure that would ensure healthcare and rehabilitation for the addicted if the person is not guilty of any serious crime. According to the Decriminalization of Drug Use and Possession in Australia- a briefing note published by the National Drug and Alcohol Research centre of the University of New South Wales - decriminalization does not necessarily mean legalization, but rather removes criminal penalties for use or possession either by law (de jure) or by practice (de facto).Evidence supported by various research indicate that decriminalization of drug use reduces the cost to society, especially in the criminal justice system. The approach also reduces social costs to individuals, such as improving employment prospects, decrease of drug use and a drop in crime rates. However, the same strategy could in some cases, increase the numbers of people who have contact with the criminal justice system (net widening). Australia has a mixture of de jure and de facto decriminalization schemes for use and possession of illicit drugs. But there is an opportunity to expand decriminalization for drug use in Australia, particularly through de jure decriminalization schemes targeting all illicit drugs. This could further reduce costs to the criminal justice system and to the individuals, the report said. The Global Commission on Drug Policy report also encouraged experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs to undermine the power of organized crime and to safeguard the health and security of their citizens. Ashique Selim, a specialized addiction psychiatrist, told the correspondent: “As the drug addiction issue is worsening day by day, the country should adopt the decriminalization of drug use policy. “It might take some time, but if this approach could be implemented by ensuring necessary facilities for the addicted, Bangladesh would become a leading country in the region to lessen drug addiction, just like Portugal did.”Portugal has become a shining example of success by decriminalizing drug use by individuals. The Portuguese legal framework on drugs changed in November of 2000, and was implemented from July, 2001. Over the years, this approach emerged as a triumphant move by the Portuguese government, as the rate of HIV/AIDS patients dropped dramatically in the country. Following the success of drug decriminalization, the country adopted The National Plan for the Reduction of Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies 2013-2020. The national plan states that treatment interventions should be based on a comprehensive diagnosis of each citizen’s biological and psychosocial needs, be accessible and adaptable, be based on scientific evidence in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and quality. The treatment of addicts should also be underpinned by government guidelines, the plan stated. According to an estimate by the Portuguese Health Ministry, heroin use among citizens stood at around 100,000 people when the policy was launched, but it has now dropped to 25,000. The number of Portuguese citizens dying from drug overdose went down by more than 85%, before rising a bit during the aftermath of the European economic crisis in recent years. Even so, Portugal’s drug mortality rate is the lowest in Western Europe- one-tenth the rate of Britain or Denmark, and about one-fiftieth of the latest numbers for the USA. In recent years, a number of countries in the developed world have partially decriminalized drugs, and many other countries like Australia, USA, Ireland, Iran and many more are researching on decriminalizing drug use by individuals. Several Scandinavian countries are also giving serious thought to implementing the approach. In a positive move, Bangladesh is also formulating the draft of a new Narcotic Substance Control Act, adopting the recommendation from the three treaties. A provision in the draft act states that if a person is not convicted of any other crimes, excluding drug use, the court can term the person a drug addict and send him or her to an appropriate facility for treatment. However, if an addict refuses to accept treatment, the person can face up to five years in prison and Tk5,000 in fines if convicted.","['possession', 'policy', 'bangladesh', 'drug', 'approach', 'criminal', 'better', 'decriminalization', 'option', 'addiction', 'treatment', 'drugs', 'global']","What is drug decriminalization?
Proponents of drug decriminalization usually support the use of fines or other punishments to replace prison terms.
A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of harm reduction.
Ashique Selim, a specialized addiction psychiatrist, told the correspondent: “As the drug addiction issue is worsening day by day, the country should adopt the decriminalization of drug use policy.
Following the success of drug decriminalization, the country adopted The National Plan for the Reduction of Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies 2013-2020."

“We are sending 20 to 25 people from Bangladesh and mobilising another 15 to 20 from the missions in the other Gulf countries to Saudi Arabia to assist the Bangladeshis who need help,” Additional Foreign Secretary Mustafa Kamal told the Dhaka Tribune.

The Saudi government on May 10 declared general amnesty for all expatriates including Bangladeshis who violated residency and labour regulations, to enable them to amend their status and continue to stay and work in the Kingdom without facing penalties or fines.

Thousands of Bangladeshis are flocking into the Bangladesh missions in Riyadh and Jeddah every day to get new passports to avail the amnesty.

“Just after the announcement, Bangladeshis who don’t have passports gathered [at the embassy] in Riyadh and [the consulate] in Jeddah to get new ones. That has put added pressure on the existing workforce,” Kamal added.

“The additional workforce will work under the supervision of the Bangladesh Ambassador and Consul General in Jeddah,” he said.

They would work at “outposts,” if necessary, to provide better and smoother services to Bangladeshis, Kamal said. “We will send more people to the kingdom if the Bangladesh embassy requires.”

He said the government would everything necessary to help the Bangladeshis in the Gulf country.

“The foreign ministry has sought repatriation fund in the upcoming budget for bringing back Bangladeshis when they face troubles,” he said.

An inter-ministerial meeting, held at the foreign ministry last week, discussed on how the government could provide emergency services to the expatriates about supplying and issuing passports.

The Bangladesh embassy in Riyadh has 12 officers and more than 30 staffs.

Bangladesh’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia Md Shahidul Islam recently told the Dhaka Tribune that about 200,000 to 400,000 Bangladeshi could avail the amnesty.

The amnesty will remain valid till July 3. If any illegal worker gets a valid job offer within that date, he or she can change work status and stay legally in the country.

If any worker fails to secure any new job offer by that date, he or she will have to leave Saudi Arabia but will not have to pay any fine or face any punishment.

Officials in Dhaka said around two million Bangladeshis are now working in Saudi Arabia.

A win-win situation for all,"The BGMEA’s initiative for a garment village should have been started years ago, but it’s good to see them finally take it up, in light of the horrendous tragedy at Savar",Tribune Editorial,2013-05-23 00:00:00,"The BGMEA’s initiative for a garment village should have been started years ago, but it’s good to see them finally take it up, in light of the horrendous tragedy at Savar.

There are many reasons why the village project will be advantageous to both owners and workers. Rural land is far cheaper than the expensive high-rises in Dhaka. The structures and factories in the village can be built according to regulations from the ground up, thereby ensuring workplace safety for all. Also, it would be easier to expand the villages, so that employees wouldn’t have to work in cramped spaces, unlike in Dhaka city where there is no scope to build new buildings, much less add space.

As long as the government ensures that facilities such as water, electricity, and gas are made available, the village in Munshiganj will run successfully, and should even be the start of more garment villages to be built nationwide.

The BGMEA is doing a fine thing, but the government should take up the task of building on it on a larger scale. Such an initiative would solve many of the problems in Dhaka, including overpopulation, traffic, etc, and ease the burdens it faces.

Let us use this tragedy as a springboard for a large-scale garment village project throughout Bangladesh. In fact, let us remove the garment industries from Dhaka and its environs altogether – out of the high-rises, which were not built to handle the stress of running factories, and into less developed areas where they can be engines of economic growth.","['village', 'villages', 'initiative', 'built', 'highrises', 'garment', 'situation', 'winwin', 'tragedy', 'factories', 'project', 'dhaka']","The BGMEA’s initiative for a garment village should have been started years ago, but it’s good to see them finally take it up, in light of the horrendous tragedy at Savar.

Indian netball champion given triple-talaq for having daughter,The All India Muslim Personal Law Board claims that the practice is supported by Sharia law,Tribune Desk,2017-04-24 00:00:00,"Shumaila Javed, an Indian national netball champion, was divorced by her husband through a triple talaq over the phone for giving birth to a daughter in Uttar Pradesh. Shumaila is currently staying at her parental home in Amroha, 380km from Lucknow, and has requested that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath look into the matter, reports NDTV The triple talaq is a means for Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by saying the word “talaq"" three times. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board claims that the practice is supported by Sharia law, as marriage in Islam is a civil contract based on consent. The board further claims that talaq cannot be regulated by legislature as it falls outside the realm of the judiciary, being a matter of religion. This is not the first time that the spectre of triple-talaq has reared its head in the northern state. Earlier in Agra, 22-year-old Afrin was divorced through the practice on Facebook for having twin daughters. According to NDTV, a number of petitions have been filed to the Indian Supreme Court challenging the triple talaq, as women complained of being divorced through Facebook, Whatsapp, postcard and even via a newspaper advertisement.

Bangladesh misses major MDG targets,"The report said fund shortages and climate change remained a severe threat to achieving the remaining goalsBangladesh has hit most of the UN Millennium Development Goals' (MDGs) targets ahead of the 2015 deadline, but will miss 11 indicators, including employment generation, adult literacy and the elimination of hunger poverty, a government report says",Tribune Report,2014-09-07 00:00:00,"Bangladesh has hit most of the UN Millennium Development Goals' (MDGs) targets ahead of the 2015 deadline, but will miss 11 indicators, including employment generation, adult literacy and the elimination of hunger poverty, a government report says.

The report said fund shortages and climate change remained a severe threat to achieving the remaining goals.

Dr Shamsul Alam, member of General Economics Division (GED) of the Planning Commission, presented the report at the National Economic Council auditorium in the capital yesterday.

The MDG progress report said the country's employment rate for the 15+ years population was 59.3% of the total population, but Bangladesh needed to create jobs for all by 2015.

The adult literacy rate for the 15+ years population is only 58.5% of the total population. According to the MDG target, the country needs to make all of its population literate by 2015.

The report said the country was still falling short of the target to arrest the primary school drop out rate at 3.6%.

Speaking at the function, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said Bangladesh had been successful in achieving the MDGs. “But it would be something ambitious to eliminate extreme poverty,” he said.

“If production can be increased, I think we can eliminate poverty by 2030,” he said. Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal said Bangladesh had done better than other nations in achieving MDG targets. He said Bangladesh wants to make the country hunger free by 2030.

UNDP Country Director Pauline Tamesis praised Bangladesh's progress in poverty reduction, primary education, reducing child mortality and reducing maternal mortality. She said it is important to recognise the way this progress was made because these achievements would provide motivation to achieve other MDGs.

Bangladesh struggled in the areas of environmental sustainability and the eradication of hunger, she said.

A firm action plan and political commitment at the highest level of government was imperative to implementing the other indicators, she said.

She said resource mobilization from the government and development partners was also important to achieving MDGs.

In 2000, the heads of state and government of 189 countries set the MDG targets to reduce poverty and hunger across the globe by 2015. Internationally, eight major MDGs were identified and every country set some specific targets to achieve by 2015. Bangladesh is a signatory to the MDG charter.

The report said data against only 33 indicators was available. According to the report, progress on 11 indicators was lagging behind target, progress was on track for 10, and targets for 12 indicators had been met.

Bangladesh's poverty rate declined to 26.2% as of 2013, the planning commission official said. According to the MDG targets, Bangladesh needed to cut its poverty rate to 29 per cent by 2015.

Bangladesh hit the targets for reducing headcount poverty and the poverty gap ratio, reducing the number of underweight children under five years of age, attaining gender parity in primary and secondary education, reducing under-five mortality rates, increasing enrolment at primary schools, lowering infant mortality rates and the maternal mortality ratio, improving immunisation coverage and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases.

The country is on track to hit the 2015 targets for increasing the net enrolment ratio in primary education, reducing the infant mortality rate, increasing the proportion of one year-old children immunized against measles, the maternal mortality rate, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, reducing HIV prevalence in the population, reducing deaths from tuberculosis (TB) per 100,000 people, and raising the proportion of people using an improved drinking water source.

There are 11 indicators where progress has been lagging behind and it is most likely that targets will not be achieved. These indicators included reducing hunger-poverty, generating adequate employment, raising the adult literacy rate, creating decent wage-employment for women, increasing correct and comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS, increasing forest coverage, and increasing access to and coverage of Information and Communication Technology.","['report', 'targets', 'population', 'mdg', 'bangladesh', 'poverty', 'indicators', 'misses', 'reducing', 'rate', 'mortality', 'major', 'progress']","The MDG progress report said the country's employment rate for the 15+ years population was 59.3% of the total population, but Bangladesh needed to create jobs for all by 2015.

Orlando shooter's 'lover': Massacre was for 'revenge',"Omar Mateen, the man behind the Orlando nightclub attack, was “100% gay” and the massacre was his “revenge attack” against men who had “used him,” says a man claiming to be his lover",Tribune Online Report,2016-06-23 00:00:00,"In an exclusive interview with Univision Noticias on Tuesday, the man, identifying himself only as Miguel, rejected claims that it was an act of terrorism. “The truth is that he didn’t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,” he said. He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus. Asked why he decided to come forward with his story, Miguel, wearing a disguise, said he felt it was his “responsibility as a citizen of the United States and a gay man.” He said he had been approached by the FBI and been interviewed three times in person by agents. Univision said it was unable to verify his account but the FBI had confirmed that it met with him. Miguel, speaking in fluent Spanish and accented English, said he and Mateen had met on a gay dating app and became “friends with benefits.” The pair had allegedly met between 15 and 20 times. Miguel never learned Mateen’s name, however. He described Mateen as a “very sweet guy,” who loved to be cuddled. “He adored Latinos, gay Latinos, with brown skin – but he felt rejected,” Miguel said. “He felt used by them – there were moments in the Pulse nightclub that made him feel really bad. Guys used him. That really affected him.” In the June 12 shooting, 49 people were killed and dozens were wounded. Mateen was killed in a shootout with police hours later. Most of the dead were Hispanic. Investigators are still looking for motives behind the shooting. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters on Tuesday that investigators may never be able to pinpoint a single motive and have not ruled out witness reports suggesting Mateen might have had gay interests. Miguel said Mateen was especially upset after a sexual encounter with two Puerto Rican men, one of whom later revealed he was HIV positive, he added. “He [Mateen] was terrified that he was infected,” Miguel said. “I asked him, 'Did you do a test?' Yes. He went to the pharmacy and did the test … it came out negative but it doesn't come out right away. It takes four to five months.” “When I asked him what he was going to do now, his answer was: 'I'm going to make them pay for what they did to me',” Miguel said.","['revenge', 'massacre', 'felt', 'asked', 'lover', 'met', 'upset', 'man', 'orlando', 'used', 'shooters', 'later', 'mateen', 'gay', 'miguel']","He said Mateen was angry and upset after a man he had sex with later revealed he was infected with the HIV virus.

“I would say that holding rallies and meetings should be banned in Motijheel,” he told a questioner after a delegation of Breeders’ Association of Bangladesh met him at his secretariat office in the morning. Association president Moshiur Rahman led the delegation, reports UNB.

Referring to the security aspect of Motijheel area following the anarchy unleashed recently by the Hefazat-e-Islam, Muhith said: “There should not be any meetings in Motijheel, and it has to be banned. Of course, the government has to make the decision and persuade everybody to accept it.”

He said different banks, financial institutions and hawkers witnessed the damage to their properties during the May 5 mayhem. The government is assessing the damage of its various financial institutions located in that area, while the FBCCI is also working to estimate the losses suffered by private business establishments during the incident.

Mentioning that the hawkers on the footpaths were the most affected during the incident, Muhith said that something would have to be done for them.

During the Dhaka siege programme by the Hefajat-e-Islam on May 5, the miscreants set fire to public properties, especially to the Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) and Janata Bank buildings at Paltan.

The finance ministry has already asked 10 state-owned financial institutions headquartered in and around Motijheel to file cases against those involved in the destruction.

The 10 institutions are: Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation (BHBFC), Janata Bank, Sonali Bank, Agrani Bank, Bangladesh Krishi Bank, Jiban Bima Corportation, Shadharan Bima, Basic Bank, Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) and Bangladesh Development Bank Limited (BDBL).

Massive arson and vandalism in Paltan, Baitul Mukarram, Motijheel and Gulistan areas during Hefazat-e-Islam’s Motijheel rally on May 5 left small businesses completely ruined.

The victims of the fire include roadside vendors who sold cheap clothes, books, stationery and miscellaneous items to office-goers and pedestrians.

Hefazat-e-Islam’s violence on Sunday has left about 800 shops burnt in Purana Paltan, Dainik Bangla and Motijheel, causing total losses of over Tk200m, shop owners’ associations say.

“In [Baitul Mokarram Shopping Complex], six jewellery shops on the second floor were completely burnt down, and on the first floor 40-45 shops were partially damaged,” Hazi Iqbal Uddin, joint secretary of Baitul Mokarram Traders Group said. He estimated the losses at Tk70m.

Di Natale to retire at end of season,"Udinese striker bringing an end to a career Udinese striker Antonio Di Natale said he will retire at the end of the season, bringing an end to a career which has seen him top Serie A's scoring charts on two occasions",AFP,2014-01-07 00:00:00,"Udinese striker Antonio Di Natale said he will retire at the end of the season, bringing an end to a career which has seen him top Serie A's scoring charts on two occasions.

In their first league outing of 2014, Udinese suffered a 3-1 defeat at home to Verona and Di Natale said post-match he intends to call it quits at the end of the campaign.

""I've spoken to my family, and now I will speak to the club about it,"" said the 36-year-old Naples-born player.

The news could not have come at a worse time for Udinese, who after a fifth place finish last season and a bright start to this campaign have dropped to 13th.

Informed of the news, Udinese coach Francesco Guidolin told reporters: ""I don't know what to say. I didn't know.""

Despite playing at a club that has enjoyed little domestic success, Di Natale has been considered one of Italy's most lethal strikers in recent years.

He finished top scorer in the 2009-2010 Serie A season, prompting an offer to join Juventus which he refused because his children were in school and well settled in the northern town of Udine.

It also earned Di Natale a place at Italy's disastrous 2010 World Cup, where he scored in a 3-2 defeat to Slovakia which left Italy bottom of their group and sealed their first round exit.

Di Natale also finished top scorer in 2010-2011, two goals ahead of Napoli's Edinson Cavani and seven ahead of Inter striker Samuel Eto'o.

A season later, he finished joint third - and the first Italian - in the Serie A scoring charts to earn a place at Euro 2012, where he was the only player to score against eventual winners Spain, during a 1-1 draw. Italy went on to the final but were defeated 4-0 by Spain.

Vulnerable groups need resilience,"The programme was chaired by Mohammad Abdul Qayyum, national policy director of Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP)Government officials and representatives from different NGOs and donor agencies yesterday emphasised on taking proper steps to develop resilience among the poor and vulnerable groups across the country for an effective disaster risk management",Abu Hayat Mahmud,2014-10-12 00:00:00,"Government officials and representatives from different NGOs and donor agencies yesterday emphasised on taking proper steps to develop resilience among the poor and vulnerable groups across the country for an effective disaster risk management.

They expressed their opinions while addressing a round-table discussion, organised jointly by Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and Centre for Disability in Development (CDD) marking the International Day for Disaster Reduction 2014, at the Daily Star Centre in the capital.

“We should find out the gaps into our policies for disaster management and reduction plan. If it is possible to mitigate risks of vulnerable groups from natural and man-made disasters, then resilience among the groups will develop,” Department of Disaster Management Director General Mohammad Abdul Wazed, told the round-table as chief guest.

“We should also focus our facilities for the disabled, including the handicapped, who mostly become victims of such disasters,” he added.

He further added that the gaps in government policies in disaster management will be adjusted based on field level experience as regional perspective, characteristics of disasters and victims experiences.

The programme was chaired by Mohammad Abdul Qayyum, national policy director of Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP).

“We are facing two types of disasters – natural and man-made. Resilience depends on the sustainable preparedness for the mitigation of the vulnerability,” said Qayyum.

Saying a large number of disabled people were now living in vulnerable conditions, he also said: “To develop resilience, we should try to involve elderly people as their experience will be helpful in making the disaster reduction plan.”

“Our disaster management plan could not be implemented properly due to some gaps in responsibilities of the authorities concerned in the government and the NGOs,” Disaster Management and Relief Deputy Secretary Md Kamrul Hasan told the round-table.

“Various NGOs are working on risk reduction and developing resilience in Bangladesh. But, few of them are not informing the government of their activities, which is very undesirable. Besides 29 ministries are also involved with this sector but cannot take proper steps due to lack of coordination,” he added.

At the same time, CDD Director Nazmul Bari said: “The government and NGOs had been working with the disable group since 2012. Not only handicap, but another groups including old, children and women, should been inculcated into the resilience development.”

“Priority for the disabled should be ensured in every sector,” he added.

Bangladesh Disaster Preparedness Centre Muhammad Director Saidur Rahmen told the round-table: “The NGOs have been working in parallel with the government. If such efforts continue, poverty will reduce which is the right way to develop resilience.”

Saintfiet confirms BFF his return,Saintfiet is scheduled to arrive in Dhaka next Wednesday and will watch the Bangladesh Premier League's sixth round matches,Tribune Report,2016-08-09 00:00:00,"Amidst all the doubts and uncertainty, Belgian coach Tom Saintfiet has confirmed to Bangladesh Football Federation about his return date on Tuesday to resume the responsibility of the national team.

Stepping out of shackles,"The array of drawings that filled the walls spoke of who were drawing them and what idea inspired them to draw such imagesIn our country, 32% of all girls are married before they reach the age of 15",Ishtiaque Mahmud,2014-10-23 00:00:00,"In our country, 32% of all girls are married before they reach the age of 15. Forced child marriages usually result in higher chances of the girl experiencing complications during pregnancy, getting infected with HIV and facing domestic violence at the hands of older husbands. Both Mitu and Tania ran the risk of being forced into an early marriage, but over time through the Adolescent Development Programme (ADP) and with support from Brac staff, they were able to convince their parents to prevent the process.

In August of 2014, Mitu and Tania attended and spoke at the DFID Youth For Change event which preceded the first ever global Girl Summit.

After its initiation back in 1993, as a subset of Brac’s school for older children, the Adolescent Development Programme have come a long way in awareness building and promoting extra curricular activities. It works with Ministry of Women & Children Affairs (MoWCA) and Department of Youth Development under the Minisry of Youth and Sports. Furthermore, MoWCA signed an MoU with brac to emulate the ADP model at the country’s seven districts of seven divisions, where ADP is providing its entire technical support.

The ADP in Manikganj was created on March 25, 2012 and it has been going quite strong since then. This is a girls-only club, comprising 25 to 35 adolescent members ranging between the ages of 10 to 19 years, or as we are more familiar with the phrase, between grade 6 to their intermediate exams. The club welcomed everyone in that age group regardless of whether they went to school or not.

The ADP club house turned out to be a neat one-storey construction made almost entirely out of tin. It appeared to hold ample space inside, but what caught the eyes instantly were the shoes that were neatly arranged in a semi circle outside on the edge of the doorway. It showed discipline with a hint of childish playfulness.

Right upon entering the club house, we stepped onto an all too humble but quite clean and rather large carpet on which teenagers wearing everything from regular, causal clothes to school uniforms were seated calmly, bordering the edges of the wall. This sitting arrangement, as we later discovered was called “The big team” which comprised the entire room full of club members inclusive of a subset of four “small teams.”

Soon enough our attention was drawn to the three walls besides the one housing a huge blackboard. The walls had areas depicting team names and where they are supposed to sit, there were also pull outs from books printed in large letters posted beside them, but what held the attention were the array of drawings that filled the walls. It simultaneously told of who were drawing them and what idea inspired them to draw such images. The subjects mostly revolved around teenage girls becoming independent and self aware.

Sessions as we later found out, were conducted by instructors who had previously received training from Brac training facilities and subsequently approved. These sessions were held twice a week, two hours a day, always on a Thursday and on any other day of the week that all the members agreed upon. Classes revolved largely around awareness regarding education, exchanging views and experiences, recreation, indoor and outdoor sports, socialising, singing, dancing and stage performances (theatre) - activities that were mostly frowned upon in their homes.

After a brief conversation with the instructor, it was revealed that heavy emphasis was given to social issues, relating to violence and illegal acts upon women. There were text books called “Apon” books that elaborated on these subjects.

APON stands for Adolescent Peer Organised Network (Life Skill based Education) and this form of education had 11 primary topics or ingredients as they like to put it. They were: decision making, contemplation, problem solving, innovation, right communication, relationship maintenance, exercising empathy, insights into situations, knowledge about the self, surviving under emotional pressure, and surviving under mental pressure.

This list is followed by a longer list of 19 social issues on which club members were educated and made aware as well. The social issues are: children rights, gender discrimination, dowry, child marriage, divorce, adolescence, menstruation cycles, dream disorders, pedophilia, rape, acid attacks, narcotic substances, addiction, terrorism, child smuggling, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV Aids, pregnant woman care and family planning.

Apart from these two lists, focus is also given on issues revolving around responsibility towards the disabled and the autistic, and on disaster risk management.

This particular instructor with her nearly flawless penmanship with a chalk, made heavy use of the blackboard, much like what we used to encounter during the early 90s in our own classrooms back in school. The first session started with a musical enactment of the subject matter from the previous class, which was divorce.

Three girls from group 1 namely, Parvin, Sumaiya and Nupur, performed admirably which showed that the members of the club were, jolly, creative, supportive and valued practice in whatever they pursue.

After the musical ended, everyone sat according to the requirements of the four small groups, which were then told to turn to a particular topic in their Apon books. This day’s topic was child marriage. The members went through the text for a while until they were asked to stop, quizzed on what they had just learned, and given points based on answers provided.

Questions were asked on the different ages of legal marriage for men and women; the adversities faced due to marrying prematurely, namely, discontinued education, physical complications and pregnancy complications relating to both the mother and the child, punishments applicable from child marriage and punishments applicable for marriage that has not been properly registered. All the four teams scored brilliantly and showed genuine comprehension and interest when they elaborated on their responses.

The awareness education session then gave way to a dance performance, followed by a solo song and a group song. While the performers were not exactly performance art competition finalists, they were in no way any less than the entrants of such competitions.

After the conclusion of performances it was time for sports and since this particular club specialised in cricket, that was what we were about to witness. All the mebers of the club were directed to collect uniforms and equipments such as, cricket bats, wickets and gloves.

On our way to the field which was some way off, we couldn’t help but be aware of something unique about the way the girls made their way to the field. The word unshackled came to mind; they walked in a distinctively unselfconscious manner that we are accustomed to seeing only in groups of adult males in cities.

Upon reaching the field which appeared to have been pulled right out of a classic Bangladeshi calendar, the girls who were now barely recognizable in their two sets of uniforms, started setting up the playing ground with crease and wicket stumps.

The game started, and as soon as they started playing, the atmosphere shifted to something serious. Gone were the carefree laughter and the free flowing rise and fall of chitchats. Faces became squinted in concentration, arms swung bringing the whole body into a fluid, airborne motion.

Beyond these obvious phenomena, what stood out was the ease and clarity with which faltering steps were shrugged off putting in place fresh concentration, in a matter of seconds. They appeared to be neither sentimental nor remorseful in their mistakes, they quickly learned from them and came back with new ferocity.

An example of this became all too prominent when the ball wasn’t bouncing high enough due to a certain wet portion of the pitch, this hurdle was instantly grasped by the bowler and in the following swing was thrown with a speed and power that compensated for the damp soft patch.

The ball swung up and uprooted the middle stump with a determined impact. The batsmen on the other hand, exuded a strange combination of grace and force that we don’t see often; the braids swinging in a circular motion in tandem with the swinging bat only added to the whole uniqueness.

Over the course of our stay, we were given information on the machinations of all the ADP club houses out there; there were numerous clubs all over the country all functioning in the same manner at different stages of development. Apparently, there were two other clubs not too far away, similar to the one we encountered except for the fact that they specialised in volley ball and football, while this one focused on cricket; along with these, there was something akin to a theatre troupe. Additionally they taught safe swimming as a preventive measure for frequent drowning risks.

We even heard plans for Karate and self defence programmes in the near future. Apart from basic training, women often travel to the city to receive formal, specialised training in certain disciplines, such as running a beauty parlour, so that upon return they could then set up shop and become a highly contributing member of the community by creating work opportunities.

Club members who are in dire need of financial aid are given a stipend and training in basic computer literacy is often provided to everyone in the club. This particular literacy programme is a collaborative effort put forth by Brac and the British Council. ADP clubs often house their own journalists, trained in news media from Brac. Along with celebrating national and international days like International AIDS day and Tree Plantation day, the clubs hold an annual fair in winter involving stalls, games and cultural programmes.

There are two major community leader workshops that span the entire year: one from January to June and the other from July to December. These involve promotion and awareness campaigns relating to issues like child marriage, dowry, divorce, rape, AIDS etc.

There is something called a Community Based Child Protection Committee (CBCPC) which consists of the senior and influential members of the community, and this body plays the role of overseeing the events and campaigns enacted by the children.

Last but not least, there is an Advanced Adolescent Group (AAG) who, during the Community Leadership Workshops, receive five day training sessions, while the same training is given to the CBCPC in three days. When endeavouring to resolve a social issue and facing insurmountable obstacles, the AAG is encouraged to consult with the CBCPC so that they can be facilitated and the issue can be resolved following the path of least resistance.","['stepping', 'adp', 'issues', 'training', 'given', 'way', 'members', 'girls', 'marriage', 'child', 'shackles', 'club']","The ADP club house turned out to be a neat one-storey construction made almost entirely out of tin.
Sessions as we later found out, were conducted by instructors who had previously received training from Brac training facilities and subsequently approved.
This list is followed by a longer list of 19 social issues on which club members were educated and made aware as well.
This day’s topic was child marriage.
These involve promotion and awareness campaigns relating to issues like child marriage, dowry, divorce, rape, AIDS etc."

Procession of dead getting bigger,"‘Please, stop the dirty politics that kill our children’
        	“Ma, do not cry; why are you worrying about me? I will be alright,” these were the last words of Ohidur Rahman Babu, one of the 19 burn victims of a passenger bus that came under arson attack near Shahbagh last Thursday",Mohammad Jamil Khan,2013-12-04 00:00:00,"“Ma, do not cry; why are you worrying about me? I will be alright,” these were the last words of Ohidur Rahman Babu, one of the 19 burn victims of a passenger bus that came under arson attack near Shahbagh last Thursday.

Babu, 23, a first-year student of Political Science Department at Dhaka College, succumbed to his injuries around 4:30pm yesterday.

He was undergoing treatment at the intensive care unit of Dhaka Medical college Hospital (DMCH), Dr Partha Sankar Pal, residential surgeon of the unit told the Dhaka Tribune.

“Babu died as 28% of his respiratory system was damaged from the fire; he had been on life support since Monday,” says Dr Partha.

With the death of Babu the death toll in Shahabagh bus fire stands at three. Earlier, two cousins died within a span of two days into the incident.

After his death a pall of gloom descended on hospital with his relatives bursting into tears.

“Babu went out of his rented house at Bangabazar around 5:30pm and on his way to Shahbagh. He promised he would be back early but he could not keep his promise,” Babu’s mother Saleha Khatun whimpered under her breath.

Babu was so strong-willed boy that he told his mother not to cry as he believed nothing would happen to him.

“He was supposed to go to America on December 17 but he left us for a country unknown to us,” Saleha said fighting her tears back.

Hailing from Biramganj of Noakhali he was the son of Hazi Waziullah who has been missing since 2011. He has two brothers and two sisters.

Before he was put on life support doctor Azad told Babu after the life support he may die or survive. The doctor asked for his decision. “Is it really needed? Will it be a problem for me?” he asked the doctor.

On hearing the death news of Babu all his relatives and friends dashed to the burn unit. His sister-in-law Shanara Akter Shanu cried her heart out: “Babu wants to live but the dirty politics of our country did not let him live.

“Can the government bring our children back? Please, stop the nasty politics that takes children away from their mother’s lap,” Shanu was seething with anger.

She was cursing the foul politics of the country as she was wailing and sobbing.","['babu', 'shanu', 'told', 'bigger', 'dead', 'country', 'death', 'procession', 'unit', 'support', 'politics', 'dhaka', 'getting', 'life']","Babu, 23, a first-year student of Political Science Department at Dhaka College, succumbed to his injuries around 4:30pm yesterday.

Woof woof?,Communicating with your canine friend,Anonyo J Haque,2017-02-20 00:00:00,"“An animal’s eyes have the power to speak a great language.” ― Martin Buber Little did the Austrian-born Israeli philosopher from the 19th century know that this simple sentence would resonate so much with animal lovers out there. Not to be biased here, but if you have a dog, then you know that no truer words have ever been spoken. Whether you're in love with a great shaggy mutt or a tiny little yapster, you know that language is as important to animals as it is to us humans, especially when they're trying to convince you to give them another treat or go for another walk in the park. Having said that, while most of the time you think you're perfectly tuned to the needs of your real best friend (let's admit it, your pet is always your best friend), sometimes it can also be difficult to understand the language they're speaking. Always remember, most animals tend to utilise body language to interact, and dogs aren't an exception. Before you and your canine friend can engage in conversation for hours, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. It is important that you observe your dog's movement, behaviour, mannerism and so forth. Learning how your pet normally behaves will allow you to know when something is wrong and respond to subtle signals of stress and unhappiness, thus avoiding more aggressive and distressed behaviour. Communication is always a two-way learning process, one where you have to transmit what you mean when you say “sit” or “no” because dogs cannot understand English. Only telling them to “sit” won't cut it since your dog won't be able to distinguish between that and all the gibberish you say around them throughout the day. However, alluring them into a sitting position and rewarding them heavily will encourage your dog to repeat the feat. Unlike popular belief, punishing your dog doesn't really help because it is proven that they don't have a great memory and are likely to forget how angry you were when they poop on your living room carpet. They may give the “guilty look” to appease you but know that he/she cannot relate that you are angry upon seeing their mess on your mom's favourite carpet from the trade fair. Giving them behavioural cues through positive reinforcements, however, might just get the job done. Rolling over and exposing the belly can be a gesture to appease you, and a belly rub would be great reinforcement for such behaviour. Mounting or humping, on the other hand, can be signs of stress especially when a dog with low-confidence dog is trying to pledge it's loyalty with a higher confidence animal. Dogs usually have a variety of gestures and signs to express their discomfort – excessive yawning or sneezing, licking of the lips, cowering, whale eye (when the whites of their eyes are showing) or a stiff body, all can indicate that your canine friend is uncomfortable. Intervene and stop anything that you are doing which can lead to a state of uneasiness. If you are trying to make your dog comfortable with something that it does not like, make sure you reward it with a lot of treats while introducing them to the uncomfortable thing slowly. The overwhelming amount of treats will motivate them to deal with it, even if they dislike it initially. Tails are another fascinating way in which dogs communicate. A wiggly butt and therefore, a wagging tail, indicate the emotion of pure joy while a slowly wagging one can mean that it is in a cautious state. On the other hand, a stiff tail shows signs of alertness and a low tail can mean that your dog is content. Lastly, a tucked tail can be evidence that your pet is scared and shows a feeling of uncertainty. Your dogs' ears can be another set of signals for you to understand when you are trying to interpret their mood. Pricked ears can be a sign that your dog is concentrating on something, curious, or engaged in play. It can also show intent, curiosity and that your dog is trying to catch sounds. Flattened ears, on the other hand, can indicate that your dog feels afraid and threatened. Ears that are close to the head and forward may also indicate aggression. Lastly, ears that are part way back but not completely flattened can also mean that your canine friend is unhappy or anxious.","['trying', 'woof', 'ears', 'indicate', 'tail', 'dog', 'know', 'language', 'friend', 'mean', 'dogs']","Not to be biased here, but if you have a dog, then you know that no truer words have ever been spoken.

Sundarbans in grave danger,"We need to stop the passage of ships through the forest, and halt so-called development projects near the Sundarbans",Kallol Mustafa,2016-03-21 00:00:00,"There is no saying when the oil slick will be removed from the water and when fish will again be found. What will happen to the livelihoods of the fishermen in this situation? Who will feed their families?

Nothing has been heard regarding relief efforts for these affected people. Who knows, perhaps the government is thinking that if it can keep the forest-dwellers starving in this manner, more of them will be motivated to use their bare hands, and their kitchen pots and pans to extract the oil and sell 30 litres each to the Padma Oil Company!

However, the people didn’t get the idea of collecting the thick layer of oil this way from the government, instead, witnessing the inaction of the government and motivated by the desire to save their beloved Sundarbans, they came up with this way of soaking up the oil themselves and storing it in polythene bags in the soil.

On observing their efforts, the government people then came up with the idea of paying them to clean up the oil in this way.

Now the question is: Is it possible to clean up the whole pollution of the Sundarbans by picking up the oil by hand in this way? Was this the only way of extracting the oil?

Who was worrying about the health risks of the ones who are using their bare hands to extract the oil? Would the members of the Forestry Department, the Secretariat of Environment, the coastguard, and the navy be willing to extract the oil with their bare hands, eschewing the use of gloves and other protective body covers?

What was the point of endangering the health of the people in order to save the health of the environment? If the oil was to be extracted in this manner, why were the people being used to do this job instead of using the various departments of the governments as well as the manpower of the armed forces?

Even if it turns out that, by taking advantage of this spontaneous effort by the people, we could extract the thick layer of oil that had collected on the banks of the waterways, what would happen to the thin layer of oil that was floating on the rivers and canals spread across an area of 80 to 100 square kilometres?

Or how would the oil be extracted that has seeped into the muddy earth which is regularly flooded by high and low tide?

There was talk of using a Chinese-made oil dispersant spray called Lloyed-2.

These chemicals are usually used to fight oil pollution on open seas. It’s not advisable to use such chemicals on mangrove wetlands without carefully considering their effects, as their application may cause even more unforeseen harm than benefits.

We spoke to Sundarbans specialist Dr Abdullah Harun from the Department of Environment at the University of Khulna about what steps should be taken to rid the Sundarbans of the oil. According to him:

First, the heavy oil that had collected in the canals have to be removed. But to achieve this, we shouldn’t depend on the spontaneous efforts of the people, but rather, employ the various governmental agencies and members of the armed forces in an organised way.

And to extract the oil, sponges and other oil absorbent material and instruments should be used in addition to using hands.

Second, before deciding to use chemical sprays to remove the floating layer of oil, we need to consider many things.

One cannot afford to lose time reaching this decision however, and the work of extracting oil using sponges and other absorbent material and vacuum machinery by the governmental agencies and members of the armed forces must begin as soon as possible.

Third, steps must be taken to extract the oil from the layer of mud that is regularly flooded by the tides, if necessary 4-5cm of soil must be extracted to achieve this.

Fourth, the oil that had collected at the base of the trees must be removed. If bare hands are used to clean the oil stuck at the base or the breathers, it may cause much damage.

The scale of danger will not become apparent right away, as we have seen from incidents of oil spills in mangrove forests in other countries in the past, it takes several weeks or even several years for the effects of the pollution to become fully manifest.

It may take a mangrove forest several decades or even half a century before it recovers.

What the Sundarbans will look like in the near future depends on the number of trees and animals that have fallen victims to the oil pollution, and also on how much of it has been affected and to what extent, and lastly, on what remedial steps are being taken.

However, the recent (lack of) actions by the government don’t give us any reason to be hopeful.

A government which has turned deaf ears to repeated requests to stop all traffic of ships carrying dangerous cargo through the Sundarbans, who, despite strong protests, is planning to build two coal-based power plants in the vicinity of the Sundarbans, the future of the Sundarbans is by no means safe in such a government’s hands.

In the face of this, the only way to free the Sundarbans of the oil, and to ensure that the passage of ships through the forest is banned in the future, and to halt so-called development projects such as the NTPC and Orion Coal Power Plant next to the Sundarbans, is to build strong public pressure on the government to do so.

The City,A short story,Ornob Alam,2017-09-16 00:00:00,"I wanted to sing Tagore songs again, to people who knew him. I wanted to sit idly in the periphery of all my grandaunts and their adult children as they had serious conversations I did not need to be a part of. My interest in cultures had slowly morphed into a renewed interest in my own culture

Hell was invented on a day like this. Or perhaps it was heaven. I have been told I have a negative bias. In all fairness, when faced with such unbearable heat, people probably took the escapist approach, and came up with the idea of heaven. The late morning sun shines brightly on the beautiful city of Dhaka. Beautiful because it must be. The city of dreams pushes forward with a broken grace, its brokenness endlessly pulling on romantic hearts. It functions while being oblivious to its own intricate apparatus, its lack of self-consciousness a break in the monotony of a post-modernist world. It attracts millions that do not have to be here. Or perhaps they do. In the real world, it is the industrial and commercial centre of the country with thousands of rungs for people to latch on to as they try to climb up the economic ladder. Still, I did not have to be here. I see the girl walking towards me through a cloud of dust. Dhaka’s natural sepia filter. Today is the day we decide. Leave or stay? Not just the city, but potentially each other. I am taken back to where I think it all began. I was still a hateful little teenager when I first really met her. She was smarter than me, with her dreams of technological innovation and a fulfilling life. What we shared was a desire for freedom. Which means something quite mundane in a place like Dhaka. All of that was not immediately apparent, though. “Don’t you go to my school?” she asked. “Yes.” “What were you chasing around?” “I am collecting butterflies to put them in a jar.” “Why?” “I don’t know.” My parents often told me about how Dhaka used to be a safer place, a quieter place. They had grown up playing outdoors, visiting neighbourhood friends, and going to bazaar on their own. Was it nostalgia that motivated these fond remembrances? Or were they deriving some kind of perverse pleasure from recounting them to a child who was being raised in an incubator. I am aware this is quite universal in my generation. While safety concerns here are often not ill-founded, there are other things that compromise movement and growth in this otherwise wonderful city.Conservative culture perpetuates several monstrosities. In Dhaka, it is, among other things, a constant source of reinforcing the gender barrier. I suppose women are kept safe from my lustful eyes during those partitioned milads, and me from my own lustful nature. But growing up in a setting that emphasises difference more than our common humanity, we understand each other less, and are therefore more hostile. Furthermore, people not adhering to strictly conservative standards are thought of as lesser humans, leading to the popular custom of blaming sexual harassment on the victim’s clothes or character. A culture built on the shaming of victims, a lack of trust in men’s sense of compassion, and a lot of trust in their capacity to turn into rapists -- makes it very difficult to find and hold on to love. Not because girls do not trust me, but because it largely creates the unsafe environment that it apparently warns of. In such a context, people are never free, and dreams die. By the time we were in the final year of high school, we had become good friends. She had decided on biomedical research as her calling, and was applying to biology programmes in universities in the US and Canada. Through a combination of her influence and some vague interest in viruses, I was also doing the same. I mainly wanted to leave Dhaka, but even then, I was, albeit obliviously, in love with the city. Inexplicably, but inextricably, I was part of the chaos. But for now, I would be separated from it, if only to gain more perspective. “I am never coming back to this hellhole,” I smirked. “Will you?” “I probably shouldn’t. Not much goes on in our field here. But it’s hard to say. I will miss the little habits I have developed in all these years of growing up here, the places I go to, the people I know.” “All very replaceable.” “You think so?” We were together all through our undergraduate years. It was the best time. All the freedom and spontaneity I had ever dreamed of. We could stay out as late as we wanted, and on the spur of the moment would decide on driving out to distant cities, grades and deadlines be damned. But it never affected her grades, to be honest. In our junior year, she was working in a lab that studied HIV in a mouse model. I have not forgotten to this day how HIV virions replicate after she explained it to me the night before our virology final. She had grown into an amazingly intelligent academician, even at that young age. She won research fellowships left and right, and was headed down a path of academic superstardom. I was doing something in some lab too, mostly because I felt like I had to. I had grown into a sort of culture junkie. I enjoyed the humanities more than cell biology, and was quite adept at synthesising arguments for why religion is secretly nihilistic, how Basic Instinct was a feminist take on film noir, and why the history of theatrical traditions is more reflective of a society than its chronology of leaders. All very pointless. We went to different universities for our master’s degrees. Somehow, my lack of ambition had not caught up with me yet, and I was able to breeze through a prestigious programme and immediately get a job in the city she was studying in. Her Master’s work had been so impressive that she was staying on to get a PhD at the same lab. Everything had come together nicely. But by this point I was desperate to come back to live in Dhaka. The transformation had been gradual. Aspects of my childhood to which I had never given much thought to were revealed to be important to me. I wanted to sing Tagore songs again, to people who knew him. I wanted to sit idly in the periphery of all my grandaunts and their adult children as they had serious conversations I did not need to be a part of. My interest in cultures had slowly morphed into a renewed interest in my own culture. I felt a sense of responsibility to my people. I came up with noble, but perhaps half-baked ideas and aspirations of improving public health and education in Bangladesh, and yanking the country up from its death spiral. To confound the issue, she actually understood and sympathised. I did not ask her to come back with me. She deferred the beginning of her PhD, and we came back to Bangladesh in June last year. The idea was to spend the year here, and reevaluate at the end. She found work as a lecturer at a private university, and I got a job at an NGO. Now it is time to decide, and I am no closer to having a clear answer. I have loved living here for the first time since I was a teenager. There is so much to do for entertainment and learning in the cultural sphere now, especially for someone interested in somewhat academic aspects of art, folk history, and traditional music. Last November, we were able to watch a Santali play, listen to Scottish folk musicians perform, and attend a solemn Russian piano recital, among numerous others. These were interspersed with visits to open mics where one could always expect to hear white men and women attempt Bengali songs with unabashed enthusiasm. Dhaka has truly arrived. Alongside such pointlessness, I have even found work to be quite fulfilling. More importantly, I suppose, the work feels necessary. But Dhaka is still Dhaka. Chaos gives birth to chaos. The same inhibiting environment still pervades the city and its residents. Always vaguely violent, it now directly threatens and interferes with our daily lifestyles. Our naïve brand of Arab worship has probably facilitated this degeneration into a society that produces educated militants. Further degeneration, I should say. Marriage is now a pressing need in my life, if everyone I know is to be believed. I cannot even go on overnight trips with someone I have lived with, which is an ultimately minor but strangely persistent thorn in my side. The familiar two-fingered claw of safety concerns and acceptable bhodro behaviour creeps up behind me, and pulls me back by the collar at every step. Traveling in a CNG has probably negated the positive effects of quitting cigarettes. More often than I care to think about, the boot of political influence kicks through all the rungs of the economic ladder like a great equaliser as the entire city is brought to a standstill to let one individual pass. Equal in our collective insignificance.But if chaos gives birth to chaos, what am I? What right do I have to leave? But what right do I have to stay and complicate things for someone who has been beside me for so long? In the real world, I am an individual. I owe nothing to a place or a society, but I owe something to her and myself. Should I rot in the increasingly acidic vomit of a civilisation, or move elsewhere and build a fulfilling life, whatever that may be? How bad could racial micro-aggressions in the US ever be? How bad could singing Tagore songs just for myself be?How bad could it be to not contribute to stopping the brain drain to the West? Quite bad. But not as bad as letting her leave without me. Not even as bad as living here. I smile at the girl as she emerges from the cloud like rain. The city of death relaxes its chokehold, and I breathe in some more dust.","['work', 'songs', 'interest', 'probably', 'wanted', 'city', 'dhaka', 'quite', 'bad', 'chaos']","The late morning sun shines brightly on the beautiful city of Dhaka.

Woes back for the poor in Lalmonirhat,"The district has been swept over by icy winds coupled with dense fog in the past two weeks
        	A double whammy of intense cold waves and scarcity of winter clothes has made life miserable for the poor residents of char areas and people with limited income in Lalmonirhat, affecting their livelihood and increasing susceptibility to winter diseases",,2013-12-19 00:00:00,"A double whammy of intense cold waves and scarcity of winter clothes has made life miserable for the poor residents of char areas and people with limited income in Lalmonirhat, affecting their livelihood and increasing susceptibility to winter diseases.

The district has been swept over by icy winds coupled with dense fog in the past two weeks and those living near Teesta and Dharla rivers took the full brunt of them.

The situation has been similar in all five upazilas of Lalmonirhat and many have complained of disruption in their daily life and livelihood as they could not go out for work – especially in the morning – because of the severe cold outside.

Seher Ali, 48, a day labourer living at the Char Sholmari village of Kaliganj upazila, said, “I could not go out to work in the last few days due to the biting chill and heavy fog outside. I have no warm clothe either, which could protect me against the cold.”

“There are many like me facing the same situation. Their life, as well as mine, depends on the income we earn daily and an inability to work means starvation for us all. Those of us who borrowed money from the moneylenders to support ourselves through this phase did so with high interest rates.”

Khadiza Bewa, 72, who lives at the Wapda village of Mogholhat union, said she was too poor to afford buying warm clothes but the government and non-government organisations were not any help either.

“If I had a blanket, I could do well during this winter. My sons earn by pulling rickshaws but their incomes are too meagre to afford anything other than meeting our very basic needs, such as food and daily essentials,” she added.

There are allegations that items of winter clothing that are distributed by the government during winter often land in the wrong hands, with chairpersons of union parishads setting aside a significant portion of them for their own relatives and party loyalists.

However, Idris Ali, chairman of Kulaghat union parishad, refuted the allegation saying allocations for such purposes often tended to be small. “Only 70 blankets have been given for my union so far, which are really insufficient for such a large group of people needing them.”

“There are at least 5,000 people who can be categorised as ultra-poor in the union; they all need warm clothes but none affords buying that at the market.”

In this regard, Lalmonirhat District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Mahasinul Haque said his department had sent a request for 15,000 blankets to the ministry in the last week but received no reply yet.

The department had so far received about 3,400 blankets since the start of winter which were disbursed among cold-hit people of 45 unions of the five upazilas, he added.","['blankets', 'village', 'daily', 'woes', 'winter', 'lalmonirhat', 'union', 'life', 'work', 'poor', 'warm', 'clothes']","A double whammy of intense cold waves and scarcity of winter clothes has made life miserable for the poor residents of char areas and people with limited income in Lalmonirhat, affecting their livelihood and increasing susceptibility to winter diseases.

Nation ready to welcome Bangla New Year 1425,President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have issued separate messages conveying their Pohela Boishakh greetings to the people of the country,Sumaiya Binte Shams,2018-04-13 00:00:00,"Pohela Boishakh, the first day of the Bangla calendar, will be celebrated across the country on Saturday amid much festivities. True to a centuries-old tradition, people from all walks of life will throng different popular and historic spots at dawn in Dhaka and around Bangladesh to welcome Bangla New Year 1425 with new hopes and aspirations for a better, more peaceful year. The celebrations of Pohela Boishakh have become an integral part of Bangali lives since they began over six centuries ago. Mughal Emperor Akbar introduced the Bangla calendar in 1556 of the Gregorian calendar in a bid to streamline the timing of land tax collection in the then “Subah Bangla” region, much of which falls under Bangladesh on Saturday. The day is a public holiday. On the occasion, President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued separate messages conveying their New Year's greetings to the people of the country and all Bangla-speaking people across the world. Traders and shopkeepers across the country will open “Halkhata,” a new book of accounts, and entertain customers and visitors with sweets on the first day of “Noboborsho” – Bangla for “new year” – as part of the tradition. On every return of Pohela Boishakh, which is the largest cultural festival in the country, people from all walks of life, especially young people, come out on the roads at daybreak wearing traditional attire to celebrate the day.Thousands of people will flock to different parts of Dhaka, including Ramna Park, Suhrawardy Udyan, Central Shaheed Minar, Dhaka University, Shahbagh, and Dhanmondi Lake, to welcome the New Year. The most colourful celebration of the Bangla New Year begins at the Ramna Batamul at dawn with an elaborate program undertaken by Chhayanaut, a leading cultural troupe. The fine arts students of Dhaka University will bring out Mongol Shobhajatra, the procession of good wishes – in the morning as a part of the carnival. State-owned Bangladesh Television (BTV) and Bangladesh Betar and private TV channels will air special programs on the day. Various socio-cultural organizations have also chalked out elaborate programs to celebrate the day. Bangla Academy, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, and Nazrul Institute will organize separate cultural events. Extensive security measures have been taken in the city and elsewhere across the country for smooth celebrations on the day. No programs will be allowed in open air places after 5pm, while the authorities of Rabindra Sarobar have been asked to end their program by 7pm. Police have banned anyone participating in Mongol Shobhajatra from wearing masks for security reasons. Several watchtowers have been set up while adequate searchlights have been arranged in the Ramna Batamul area. A number of mobile courts will be deployed in the Ramna and Dhaka University areas to speedily address any violation of the law.","['day', 'welcome', 'programs', 'pohela', 'bangladesh', 'university', 'cultural', '1425', 'bangla', 'country', 'dhaka', 'nation', 'ramna', 'ready']","Pohela Boishakh, the first day of the Bangla calendar, will be celebrated across the country on Saturday amid much festivities.

Rana plaza death toll reaches 960 as rescue enters 17th day,"<br />
        	Rescuers stand back from their plan to scrap recovery operation at the site of the country’s worst industrial disaster to date<br />
        Rescuers at Savar’s Rana Plaza pulled out another 131 bodies yesterday, the highest number since the use of heavy machinery began, four days after the collapse",Kayes Sohel,2013-05-09 00:00:00,"Rescuers at Savar’s Rana Plaza pulled out another 131 bodies yesterday, the highest number since the use of heavy machinery began, four days after the collapse.

The total death toll reached 960 with the new finds made 16 days into the rescue work at Rana Plaza, which housed five garment factories, and collapsed on April 24.

The disaster management control cell, which was coordinating the operation, called off its decision to finish work in a day or two.

Commander of the 14th Independent Engineering Brigade of Dhaka Cantonment, Brig Gen Azmal Kabir, said yesterday, “On Wednesday, we assumed that no more dead bodies would be found as the frequency of finding bodies was decreasing.

“But in the early hours, we unexpectedly found at least 70 bodies.”

Rescuers said that most of the bodies were recovered from the staircase of the eight-storey commercial building, which they dug into yesterday. The find has increased their fears of finding many more bodies in the rubble as a large number of people remain missing since the country’s deadliest industrial disaster.

Azmal said: “We assume that a number of workers came down by the staircase to the second floor on the day of the disaster only to find the gate of the rear entrance locked. That portion of the staircase went under the mud burying them alive.”

The army official said the rescuers could not reach the staircase in the manual phase of the operation and it was finally exposed yesterday.

When asked about how many dead bodies might be still buried in the rubble, Azmal said he could not give any numbers. “Employers cannot confirm exact number of workers, nor can we. But we will be able to give an approximate number after the rescuers reach the basement.”

He said that the army would abandon the operations once it had visual confirmation that no bodies remained after reaching the basement. “We are now digging a hole to the basement. We are assuming that few more bodies will be found there.”

However, another army official, seeking anonymity, said they would have an estimate last tonight about how many days would be needed to finish the operation.

Meanwhile, around 150 traders, who had shops in the collapsed building, organised a human chain yesterday near the site and demanded compensation for their losses. They claimed to have lost all their capital in the disaster and were inundated in debt. They sought the prime minister’s intervention.

Rana Plaza, which housed five garment factories, a market and a bank branch, collapsed after factory owners forced several thousand workers to work even though the building was marked unsafe the day before, after cracks developed on some pillars and floors.","['enters', 'disaster', 'days', 'rana', 'plaza', 'toll', 'rescue', 'bodies', 'workers', 'reaches', 'number', 'work', 'yesterday', 'day', 'staircase', '960', 'death', '17th', 'rescuers']","Rescuers at Savar’s Rana Plaza pulled out another 131 bodies yesterday, the highest number since the use of heavy machinery began, four days after the collapse.

Dhaka Division close in on title,able toppers Dhaka Division got the much needed nine run lead against KhulnaIt was a good second day’s play at the 15th National Cricket League after bowlers dominated the first day of all the matches,Mazhar Uddin,2014-04-20 00:00:00,"It was a good second day’s play at the 15th National Cricket League after bowlers dominated the first day of all the matches. It now seems that all the four matches played across the country are heading towards a result with two more days remaining in the final round of the first class competition. Table toppers Dhaka Division got the much needed nine run lead against Khulna as Nurul Hasan smashed yet another ton for Dhaka in the league which surely would aid Dhaka Division towards clinching the title.

Dhaka Division v Khulna Division

Dhaka batsmen could not capitalize on their good work on the first day when they bundled out Khulna for 243 and finished promisingly on 75/1 at the end of day one at the Sheikh Kamal International stadium in Cox’s Bazar. Opener Rony Talukder could only add ten more runs to his overnight score of 32 before falling prey to the left arm spin of Abdur Razzak.

Razzak, who took 13 wickets including a remarkable figure of 9/91 against Dhaka Metro in the last match, continued his magic as the national cricketer again proved to be instrumental in restricting Dhaka from taking a big lead. Razzak’s mesmerizing spin ensured Dhaka kept losing wickets at regular intervals.

At one stage Dhaka were struggling at 139/7 before the inform Nurul Hasan took the responsibility of repairing the innings and together with skipper Mohammad Sharif, added 84 valuable runs. Nurul ended up with yet another brilliant and timely ton. His 101 included six sixes and eight fours while Sharif scored 36 which helped Dhaka Division to take a lead of nine runs as they were all out for 252.

National spinner Razzak proved to be the nemesis for Dhaka as he bagged six wickets giving away 101 runs from his 33.2 overs. His recent performance with the ball proves he still is the best in domestic cricket although he had a bad time in international cricket recently. At the end of the second day, Khulna were 94/3 with both Anamul Haque (36) and Mithun Ali (8) still at the crease.

Rajshahi v Dhaka Metropolis

After being bundled out for just 126 runs in their first innings, Dhaka Metro made a good comeback by dismissing the strong Rajshahi for 207 at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong. Though Rajshahi secured a handsome lead of 81 runs, Dhaka Metro ensured there was no repeat of their first innings batting debacle in the second innings as they finished the day on 253/5 which gives them a 172 run lead with two more days remaining.

Earlier in the day, Dhaka resumed on 139/7 and the two overnight batsmen Sanjamul Islam (18) and inform Muktar Ali (39) helped Rajshahi cross the two hundred mark. Left arm spinner Abu Bakkar took four wickets for Dhaka Metro.

In reply, Dhaka Metro started brilliantly in their second innings with a 161 run opening partnership before Sikat Ali had to retire hurt on 94 after he pulled his hamstring while his partner Shadman Islam was dismissed after scoring 85 with twelve fours and a six.

However, Dhaka lost some quick wickets later in the day as left arm spinner Taijul Islam bagged two wickets for Rajshahi. Asif Ahmed was still at the crease on 52 runs as curtain fell on second day’s play.

Rangpur v Barisal

At the Khan Shaheb Osmal Ali Outer Stadium, Rangpur took a lead of 57 runs and finished the second day on 346/5 as wicket-keeper batsman Dhiman Ghosh smashed a brilliant 149 with twenty fours and a six.

Starting the second day on 89/2, Nasir Hossain was shortly dismissed after adding just five runs to his overnight 27 while his partner and national team mate Naeem Islam smashed half century and was dismissed after scoring 60. But Dhiman went on to smash a brilliant century and took Rangpur to a commendable position at the end of second day.

Barisal’s Monir Hossain, the leading wicket taker in the league so far, claimed three wickets for 91 runs from 41 overs.

Chittagong v Sylhet

At the BKSP-3 ground, Chittagong managed to restrict Sylhet to only 190 and took a first innings lead of 23 runs, all courtesy of their skipper Faisal Hossain. The veteran and occasional left arm spinner took five wickets for just 36 runs from 16 overs after Sylhet resumed the day on 75/3.

Around 7.5 million people addicted to drugs in Bangladesh

Around 43% of the unemployed population of the country are addicted to drugs.

Dr Arup Ratan Chowdhury, founder President, MANAS, Association for the Prevention of Drug Abuse, said this during a discussion at the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Nagar Bhaban office on Wednesday.

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal attended the program as chief guest, while DSCC Mayor Sayeed Khokon was a special guest at the program.

Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) Director General, Jamal Uddin Ahmed, and DMP Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia were at the program, among others.

Dr Arup said: “We have seen several official and unofficial research statistics, which say there are around 7.5 million people addicted to drugs in Bangladesh.

“Among them, 80% are youth, of whom, 50% are involved in various criminal activities.”

Of the total, 48% of drug addicts are educated and 40% are uneducated. Around 57% are sex offenders, while 7% are infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

Among the addicted population, 43% of females take yaba pills. Poor women and street children are engaged in selling and transporting different types of drugs.

Prof Arup said: “Around 1,60,000 drug traders are operating their business across the country. Among them 27,300 are women.”

“According to statistics, drug traders have increased by 29,990 in the last one year,” he said.

Mentioning an ICDDR,B survey, he said: “A drug user spends around Tk56,560 to Tk90,800 in a year. 7.5 million drug addicts spend about Tk50,000 crore annually.

But according to intelligence reports, the average annual expenditure of a drug addict is Tk2.5 lakh.

Home Minister Kamal in his speech at the discussion said: “We have strengthened our drug laws, where the punishment is much more severe. Recently, over a hundred yaba traders have surrendered in Teknaf.

“We want to convey to drug traders the message there is still time. Come back or the result will be horrible.”

Mayor Khokon in his speech also announced the removal of all chemical warehouses within the next month from the residential areas of Old Dhaka.

Measures will also be taken against those found to be storing chemicals in old Dhaka, he said.

DMP Commissioner Asaduzzaman Mia said if any police officials are found to be involved in drug trade or abuse, stern action will be taken against them.

Speakers at the program urged working together to remove drugs from society once and for all.","['guest', 'minister', 'unemployed', 'addicted', 'drug', 'asaduzzaman', 'traders', 'million', '43', 'dhaka', 'program', 'kamal', 'drugs', 'population']","Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal attended a discussion program as chief guest at the Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Nagar Bhaban office on Wednesday, February 27, 2019 Dhaka TribuneAround 7.5 million people addicted to drugs in BangladeshAround 43% of the unemployed population of the country are addicted to drugs.

No let-up in hassles during journey home,"Eid holidaymakers face disruptions to schedule, congestion on highways
        	Unpleasantness befell Eid holidaymakers during their travel by roads and rivers as buses, trains and launches – three affordable modes of transportation – fell behind their schedules",Ashif Islam Shaon,2013-10-14 00:00:00,"Unpleasantness befell Eid holidaymakers during their travel by roads and rivers as buses, trains and launches – three affordable modes of transportation – fell behind their schedules.

A heavy rush of vehicles created congestion on highways yesterday since vacationers joined the mad rush to embark on their journey home for celebration of Eid ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of the Muslims.

The vehicles did not exactly get stuck in the three major highways — Dhaka-Mymensingh, Dhaka-Tangail and Dhaka-Aricha, but were moving very slowly.

Bangladesh Railway authorities that introduced special trains since October 11 failed to maintain schedule till yesterday while bus companies set examples of even six to eight hours’ late.

Sufferings on highways

Our Gazipur correspondent reports there was a 40-kilometre congestion from Chandra of Gazipur to Bangabandhu Bridge in Tangail since yesterday morning.

Konabari-Salna Highway police station’s Officer-in-Charge Alamgir Sarker told the Dhaka Tribune over phone in the evening that the pressure of vehicles had been mounting with the time passing by.

Konabari, Mouchak, Safipur and Chandra, Jirani and Tangail witnessed a heavy gridlock, with Gazipur town and Dhaka-Tripur surrounding areas having the worst of it.

On Dhaka-Tangail highway, pressure of inbound vehicles was less immense. The tailback stretched from Konabari to Mirzapur and Ashulia’s Bipal to Chandra.

On Dhaka-Aricha highway, a 20-kilometre jam was created as locals blocked a road in front of Saturia bus stop of Manikganj after a CNG-run bus caught fire around 10am.

Disruptions to schedule

Officials of Kamlapur Railway Station said special train, Deyanganj express, delayed one hour and 15 minutes in the morning.

Mahanagr Parabat left the station around an hour late. Besides, every local train departed the platform from 30 minutes to one and a half hours late.

According to the railway officials, to reach the destination and come back to Kamlapur, every train was delayed at least three hours.

Abu Taher, director general of Bangladesh Railway, described disruptions to schedule as ‘typical example’ during mad rush to travel home ahead of Eid.

“We need time to clear the platform after trains reached Kamlapur. Besides, it kills sometime while passengers are getting on and off the trains,” he said.

Bus passengers suffered a lot

Most bus companies missed their schedules yesterday. The bus staff attribute jam on highways to disruption to schedule. Many passengers alleged that the companies emphasised special trips in comparison with the regular ones.

Counter Manager Shyamol Dutta of Sakura Paribahan said on the occasion of Eid they always kept in mind that every bus would at least be half an hour late to depart the station.

“One or two days before Eid, city buses ply on highways for extra income. These buses create extra pressure and tailbacks,” he added.

Launch travellers face unique experience

Apart from the scheduled launches, more than 60 special launches apparently had no specific schedules.

Passengers rushing to launch terminals complying with the launch authorities’ instruction contributed to traffic congestion on roads leading to Sadarghat.

Many were also seen walking miles with bag and family members.","['trains', 'hassles', 'eid', 'train', 'journey', 'highways', 'schedule', 'vehicles', 'railway', 'letup', 'bus', 'special', 'yesterday']","A heavy rush of vehicles created congestion on highways yesterday since vacationers joined the mad rush to embark on their journey home for celebration of Eid ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of the Muslims.

Earlier, they found nine people on the third floor of the building this morning. Of them, five were rescued so far.

Fire service officials said the rescue operation was disrupted due to rain yesterday morning, which also caused sufferings to the victims’ relatives who had long been waiting at Adharchandra School ground in search of their near and dear ones.

However, the rescuers covered the holes of the collapsed building with canvasses and thick polythene during the rain.

Rescue teams were going in from seven entry points dug into the rubble, fire service officials said. Every once in a while a badly decomposed body would be brought out, covered in cloth and plastic, to a spot where ambulances were parked.

Workers furiously sprayed air-fresheners on the bodies to cover the stench, leaving the air thick with the smell of death and cheap perfume.

The bodies were kept at the nearby Adharchandra High School grounds before being handed over to families. Many people milled around at the school, waving photos of their missing loved ones.

Heavy equipment was still not used at the site for fear of crushing survivors. ""We will continue our operation for more survivors as long as it is required. We are not thinking of wrapping up of our effort any time soon,"" a military spokesman said.

Abdus Sukur previously represented the absconded leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, Abul Kalam Azad, who was given the death penalty in January.

The tribunal on Monday also asked the prosecution to hand over all relevant papers to the defence lawyers by June 4, when further orders with regard to the case would be declared.

On May 2, the tribunal issued arrest warrants against the accused for their alleged involvement in the killing of intellectuals. The prosecution submitted the formal charges against them on April 25.

US report raises concerns over judicial loopholes,"<br />
        	The report states, “As in the previous year, the government did not take comprehensive measures to investigate and prosecute cases of security force killings",Kamran Reza Chowdhury,2013-04-21 00:00:00,"The annual human rights report by the United States points at corruption as a “serious problem” in Bangladesh’s judicial system, which is under “political pressure” – the reason behind increasing public dissatisfaction in Bangladesh, claims the US.

The section on Bangladesh in the 2012 report says disappearances, discrimination against marginalised groups coupled with poor working conditions and labour rights are major problems in Bangladesh.

The report, prepared by the US State Department on the basis of reports by local NGOs and human rights bodies, was released Friday.

“The judiciary was subject to political pressure from the government, and cases involving opposition leaders often proceeded in an irregular fashion,” said the report on the State Department’s website. In several cases the Appellate Division overturned decisions granting bail to high-level corruption suspects who are leaders of opposition parties.

“Corruption remained a serious problem within the judiciary and was a factor in lengthy delays of trials, which were subject to witness tampering and intimidation of victims,” reads the report. “Several reports by human rights groups and corruption watchdog groups indicated growing public dissatisfaction with the perceived politicisation of the judiciary.”

It however, praised the government for initiating the process to improve professionalism in the police force, with training on discipline and responsiveness to reduce corruption. Citing how the Rapid Action Battalion or Rab established an internal affairs unit, 20 officers in the unit investigated 12 cases and took appropriate action by arresting three officers accused of misconduct. The police force is also praised for incorporating instructions on the use of force in basic training, part of a community-based policing campaign.

“Despite such efforts, security forces, including Rab, continued sometimes to commit abuses with impunity,” said the report adding plaintiffs were sometimes reluctant to accuse police in criminal cases due to lengthy trial procedures and fears of retribution. “Reluctance to bring charges against police also perpetuated a climate of impunity.”

Referring to political affiliations, as “sometimes a factor in the arrest and prosecution of members of the opposition parties,” but clarified no one was prosecuted solely for political reasons.

However, security forces, including Rab and police are reported to use torture, physical and psychological abuse during arrests and interrogations – which are prohibited in the Constitution. Quoting rights group Odhikar, the report said security forces used threats, beatings, and electric shock on at least 72 persons, killing seven but the government rarely charged, convicted, or punished those responsible. Stating, “Suspected extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and kidnappings continued, with human rights groups alleging the involvement of the country’s security services.”

It mentions how official corruption and related impunity is a problem in Bangladesh, saying, “Weak regard for the rule of law not only enabled individuals, including government officials, to commit human rights violations with impunity but also prevented citizens from claiming their rights.”

In addition the report states, “As in the previous year, the government did not take comprehensive measures to investigate and prosecute cases of security force killings.”

Individuals and groups could generally engage in the expression of views via the Internet.

“The government blocked some Facebook pages, including pages depicting the Prophet Muhammad [sm] and pages critical of both the prime minister and [the] opposition leader,” said the report.

Last September, Google was asked to remove a video “The Innocence of Muslims” from YouTube and access was blocked when it did not comply.","['report', 'political', 'concerns', 'including', 'rights', 'groups', 'raises', 'judicial', 'opposition', 'loopholes', 'human', 'security', 'cases', 'corruption']","The annual human rights report by the United States points at corruption as a “serious problem” in Bangladesh’s judicial system, which is under “political pressure” – the reason behind increasing public dissatisfaction in Bangladesh, claims the US.

Government decides not to slash fund for Padma Bridge project,Finance Minister AMA Muhith in a letter has recently asked the finance division not to cut the fund for Padma Bridge projectThe government has decided not to curtail the fund allocated for the Padma Bridge project this fiscal year as it may give out ‘negative signal’ to prospective foreign bidders,Asif Showkat Kallol,2014-03-15 00:00:00,"The government has decided not to curtail the fund allocated for the Padma Bridge project this fiscal year as it may give out ‘negative signal’ to prospective foreign bidders.

Finance Minister AMA Muhith in a letter has recently asked the finance division not to cut the fund for Padma Bridge project in the revised budget for the draft Annual Development Programme in a bid to attract foreign investment.

The revised budget might be placed at a meeting of the National Economic Council to be held sometime after March 20.

The letter also revealed that the bridges division will take decision to allocate around Tk 8,100 crore for its fast-track Padma Bridge project in the next budget, official sources said.

An official of the finance division said if such amount of fund allocated, it would be higher by about Tk 1,248 crore than that of the current fiscal year.

Earlier, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal put forward a proposal to the finance division to slash the allocation for the Padam Bridge project by 70% to Tk 2,108 crore in the revised budget for the current fiscal year, but the finance division rejected the proposal.

The official said the finance division has decided not to slash any fund for the construction of Padma Bridge this fiscal year. The bridges division and planning ministry have already been informed of the matter, he added.

The finance division has also dropped the move to cut fund for Padma Bridge which was supposed to be spent on dearness allowance, subsidy and allowance for freedom fighters, the official said.

Initially, Tk 6,888 crore was earmarked for the mega project in the current fiscal year and only Tk 2,601 crore was released during the period from July to January in the fiscal year 2013-14 which is only 4% of the total amount.

The bridges division allocated Tk6,852 crore for the construction of the bridge this fiscal year.

Earlier, the finance minister said ‘major foreign contractors’ were yet to sign any agreement to construct the multipurpose bridge because the tender process could not be completed within last year.

“We will need the amount [foreign currency] after finishing the selection of foreign contractors,” he said.

The minister also said state-run Agrani Bank had been tasked with handling $2.1bn from the money market in the next five fiscal years (FY2013-14 to FY2017-18). According to the finance division, around $200m will be needed for the current fiscal year while $700m for FY15, $600m for FY16, $500m for FY17 and $100m for FY18.

The finance minister last year ruled out Russian and Chinese proposals to construct Padma Bridge. “My position is very clear. I am not prepared to accept any fixed contractor. We’ve invited international bidders. That’s my view,” he said.

Secretariat’s pro-opposition staff reorganise,"Their activities are seen inside the country’s administrative hub recently
        	Ahead of the parliamentary elections, leaders of pro-opposition employees’ organisations at the Secretariat have resumed their activities to realise several demands – breaking the silence after roughly five years",Mohosinul Karim,2013-12-07 00:00:00,"Ahead of the parliamentary elections, leaders of pro-opposition employees’ organisations at the Secretariat have resumed their activities to realise several demands – breaking the silence after roughly five years.

Their activities are seen inside the country’s administrative hub recently, when the country’s political situation is volatile centring the next general elections, slated for January 5.

The pro-government organisations term those activities baseless as most of the seven demands put forward by the pro-opposition organisations have already been met or are under consideration.

Some suspect that untoward incidents might take place given the confronting atmosphere prevailing in the Secretariat between the two groups.

Nazrul Islam, president of Shachibaloy Karmakarta Karmachari Sangjukta Parishad, claimed that they had no ill motives behind being reorganised.

“We have already submitted to the government our seven-point demands which are promotion and creation of new posts, upgrading job status, increasing pay scales, eliminating discriminations, introducing risk allowances and confirmation of service for the work-charged employees. We are moving ahead to realise these demands,” he said.

On December 2, they had been chased by the pro-government officials and employees when supporters of the pro-opposition organisation went to the finance ministry to meet the minister. Other officials and law enforcers intervened to quell the untoward situation.

In late October, a section of pro-opposition public servants, terming themselves “patriot” employees, distributed anti-government leaflets inside the Secretariat raising allegations of corruption and misuse of power against several ministers, advisers and top-level civil bureaucrats.

The pro-opposition organisations are Bangladesh Shachibaloy Karmakarta Karmachari Sangjukta Parishad led by Nazrul Islam and Mahe Alam; Secretariat Personal Officers’ Association of Sultan Ahmed and Kamal Hossain; Stenotypist cum Computer Operators’ Association led by Hannan Sardar and Zillur Rahman Rashed; Office Assistant cum Computer Operators’ Association of Md Salauddin and Yusuf Mridha; Secretariat Computer Employees’ Association led by Nizamul Hassan and Nazrul Islam; Secretariat Accounts Officers’ Association headed by Aktar Hossain and Parvez Ahmed; and Secretariat Grade IV Employees’ Association led by Rahmat Ullah and Azim Uddin.

The Sangjukta Parishad was earlier led by pro-government leader Nizamul Haq Bhuiyan Milon. A section of pro-opposition employees coming out of the organisation formed a new one with the same name under the leadership of Nazrul and Mahe Alam.

Their movement is backed by a non-cadre assistant secretary of the finance division and two pro-opposition senior journalists, pro-government employees’ leaders allege.

They said there was no significant issue to launch a movement as most of the demands had already been fulfilled. The government also announced the pay commission to increase salaries and facilities for the public servants.

Ruhul Amin, secretary general of Bangladesh Secretariat Officers and Employees’ United Council, claimed that the pro-opposition officials and employees had been reorganising to create an anarchic situation in the administration.

Milon said, “A section of pro-opposition officers and employees are trying to achieve their goals by cashing in the current political turmoil. The employees and officials will resist them.”","['proopposition', 'staff', 'secretariat', 'reorganise', 'organisations', 'demands', 'officials', 'officers', 'progovernment', 'secretariats', 'led', 'association', 'employees']","Ahead of the parliamentary elections, leaders of pro-opposition employees’ organisations at the Secretariat have resumed their activities to realise several demands – breaking the silence after roughly five years.

In efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, stakeholders at an EU meeting in Brussels on June 23 decided that non-EU country nationals will face restrictions to receiving the Schengen visa if it does not take back the asylum seekers expelled from Europe. During the meeting, the 28-member bloc agreed to levy visa penalties on countries like Bangladesh, making it more difficult for their citizens to secure a visa to an EU country. Quoting credible EU sources, top German newspaper Welt am Sonntag on Sunday reported that the visa threat has resulted in an agreement with Bangladesh, with Bangladeshi officials agreeing to comply with standard procedures for repatriations. In the spring, a majority of migrants who crossed the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Italy originated from Bangladesh, a EU report claims. According to Italian Ministry of Interior, Bangladesh is just behind Nigeria as the single largest point of origin for migrants arriving by sea since 2014. The first 100 days of 2017 saw 4,645 Bangladeshis illegally arrive in Italy. Over the same period of time in 2016, there were only three Bangladeshis making the same trip. In 2016, a record high 8,131 Bangladeshi national were registered by authorities at landing points in Italy. In the first 120 days of 2017, 4,645 Bangladeshi have already been registered, 60% of last year’s total.

Yunus receives Forbes 400 Lifetime Achievement Award,"<br />
        	Yunus was humble, gracious, articulate as he gave thanks for the recognition<br />
        
        	When Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus took the stage at the second annual Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy in New York Wednesday night, he described feeling “overwhelmed” by the “Cinderella moment",Forbes,2013-06-08 00:00:00,"When Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus took the stage at the second annual Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy in New York Wednesday night, he described feeling “overwhelmed” by the “Cinderella moment.”

As a rural Bangladeshi from a poor family, Yunus never expected to be in the same room as Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Bono, and some of the richest people in the world, he said let alone honoured in their presence.

But there he was, receiving the inaugural Forbes 400 Lifetime Achievement Award for Social Entrepreneurship. Yunus was humble, gracious, articulate as he gave thanks for the recognition. Yet the man who is regarded as the godfather of lending to the poor didn’t miss the opportunity to send a gentle, but crystal-clear message to the world’s ultra-rich. “Making money is a happiness. And that’s a great incentive,” he told the billionaires and near-billionaires over dinner in the United Nations Delegates Dining Room. “Making other people happy is a super-happiness.”

“I lend money to poor women! I give $30 loans,” he said. “And when she holds this money, she shakes, she trembles, she cannot stand still. She cannot believe anybody could give such a huge money in her hand. She never, not only she never held this money, she never saw such an amount of money in her life. And tears will roll down her eyes, not believing this is true. And then she starts feeling that if anybody has trusted her with such an enormous amount money, $30 or $35, she will give her life to make sure that trust is kept.”

Yunus also charmed the crowd with a tale of how he turned beggars into entrepreneurs. Grameen gives beggars loans of $5, $6, $10. “We tell them, ‘Look, as you go from house to house begging, for food, for some money so you can survive for the day, why don’t you carry some merchandise, some cookies, some candy, some foods, so that you have two things to sell?’”

When Grameen started its beggar lending project, Yunus expected 1,000 or so beggars to participate. But right away, more than 100,000 joined in. “Within two years, more than 25,000 beggars stopped begging completely. Because they become such a successful door-to-door salesperson,” Yunus told the dinner guests. “And my colleagues were saying, ‘How long do we have to wait for the others?’ I said, ‘Don’t push them. Begging is their core business. You don’t push them to change their core business overnight.’”

The crowd laughed uproariously. Then a hush fell upon them as Yunus delivered his charge.","['room', 'lifetime', 'dont', 'told', 'push', 'receives', '400', 'poor', 'award', 'beggars', 'forbes', 'money', 'achievement', 'begging', 'yunus', 'making']","But there he was, receiving the inaugural Forbes 400 Lifetime Achievement Award for Social Entrepreneurship.

Padma Bridge scam: Bangladeshi surrenders in Canada,"Zulfiqur, a dual Bangladeshi-Canadian citizen, was charged by the Mounties in September with violating Canada’s foreign bribery law, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act
        	A Bangladeshi businessman, who was facing charges of conspiring with employees of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc to bribe the officials of the country in order to secure a contract for the much-talked-about Padma Bridge project, has surrendered himself before Canadian authorities",Tribune Online Report,2013-12-04 00:00:00,"A Bangladeshi businessman, who was facing charges of conspiring with employees of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc to bribe the officials of the country in order to secure a contract for the much-talked-about Padma Bridge project, has surrendered himself before Canadian authorities.

The businessman, Zulfiquar Ali Bhuiyan, 48, surrendered on Tuesday morning to the RCMP’s national division, which for more than two years has been probing a now disbanded unit of the Canadian engineering firm, reports the globe and mail.

The unit, which was based out of SNC’s Oakville, Ont, offices, allegedly conspired to bribe its way to the top of a competition to supervise the construction of the six-kilometre bridge.

Zulfiqur, a dual Bangladeshi-Canadian citizen, was charged by the Mounties in September with violating Canada’s foreign bribery law, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

He returned to Canada on the weekend to face the charge, his lawyer Frank Addario said after a brief court hearing Tuesday morning.

Later, Zulfiqur was released on bail.

“He travelled halfway around the world to voluntarily face charges under an untested law, just to clear his name,” said the lawyer.

Since Canada introduced the law – which forbids the bribery of foreign officials by Canadian companies and individuals – in 1999, police have laid the charge less than a dozen times, and only one of those cases has proceeded to trial.

Zulfiqur was the fifth person to be charged by the RCMP in connection with the suspected corruption plot, which has scuppered the bridge project that was designed to link the southwest portion of Bangladesh with the capital.

The development agency of the World Bank has withdrawn a $1.2-billion loan after bribery allegations first surfaced.

Three employees of SNC-Lavalin have already been charged under Canada’s foreign bribery act, including a former senior executive, Kevin Wallace. Two other former SNC Ramesh Shah and Mohammed Ismail have also been charged.

The fifth individual sought, Abul Hasan Chowdhury, is a Bangladesh-based lobbyist.

Zulfiqur was not an employee of SNC. He operated, among other ventures, a garment factory, said his lawyer.

Andrew Wiese, a prosecutor with the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, declined to explain how Mr. Ali Bhuiyan figures into the alleged conspiracy, citing a court-ordered publication ban from a preliminary hearing in May.

According to a letter written by an external panel of the World Bank that was sent to the Bangladeshi Anti-Corruption Commission, a trip that SNC officials made to Bangladesh in May, 2011, is central to the alleged bribery plot.

The World Bank letter, which was leaked to the media in Dhaka, alleged that during the trip SNC officials, including Wallace and Ramesh, met with the then communications minister of Bangladesh.

After the meeting, the letter alleges, Ramesh jotted down a list of Bangladeshi public officials with percentages next to their titles – “40% Min” and “1% Secretary” – in a notebook.

Under the list he allegedly wrote the heading “PCC,” which is “a euphemism used by SNC-Lavalin to indicate the cost of the bribes to be paid,” Luis Moreno Ocampo, the chair of the World Bank panel, wrote in the letter.

Bangladesh is one of the numerous countries where SNC is facing allegations of bribery. The company’s former chief executive, Pierre Duhaime, has been accused of multiple fraud and corruption-related crimes by Quebec’s anti-corruption task force in connection with payments that SNC allegedly made to secure the $1.3-billion contract for a new Montreal hospital.

Riadh Ben Aissa, a former executive vice-president in charge of SNC’s international construction, also faces charges in connection with the hospital payments. He is currently detained in Switzerland, where authorities are probing how he used that country’s secretive banking system to funnel an estimated $160-million to Saadi Gadhafi, the son of the late Libyan dictator.","['scam', 'letter', 'officials', 'foreign', 'bridge', 'surrenders', 'bribery', 'public', 'padma', 'snclavalin', 'world', 'snc', 'canada', 'bank', 'bangladeshi', 'ramesh']","Zulfiqur, a dual Bangladeshi-Canadian citizen, was charged by the Mounties in September with violating Canada’s foreign bribery law, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.

Judges praised the courage and bravery of Burhan Ozbilici, a photographer for Associated Press, who stood his ground as 22-year-old policeman Mevlut Mert Altintas pumped nine bullets into ambassador Andrei Karlov at the opening of an Ankara exhibition.

Altintas shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Don't forget Aleppo"" as he opened fire, vowing that those responsible for events in Syria would be held accountable.

""From the moment I heard the shots I knew this was a historic moment, very serious,"" Ozbilici told AFP. ""I knew I had to do my job. As a journalist, I couldn't just run away to save my skin.""

The vivid photo was to go viral around the world, and has been viewed some 18 million times.

The judges from the World Press Photo Foundation in Amsterdam acknowledged they had had a tough job to choose the 2017 winner from more than 80,400 images submitted by 5,034 photographers from 125 countries.

Ozbilici, who covered the failed coup bid in Turkey and has carried out missions in Syria, Libya and Egypt, said he always tried to be ready for difficult tests, ""to have the courage to confront a world which has been made rotten by the dishonest and corrupt, in order to try to do some good.""

He said he was sorry for the death of the envoy, whom he described as a ""natural, kind, sincere man"" whose death was a direct consequence of the ""Syrian catastrophe.""

""This photo marked an important moment in the history of Turkey, especially in its relations with Russia,"" said Ozbilici, who has worked for AP since 1989.

'Edge of abyss'

Jury members agreed his photo captured an important moment in time.

""Right now I see the world marching towards the edge of an abyss,"" said jury member Joao Silva, referring to Altintas as a man who had ""clearly reached a breaking point."" ""This image to me talks"" of everything that is happening across the world. ""It is the face of hatred.""

Irked growers burn jute in symbolic protest,"Farmers are failing to sell them at expected prices
        	Jute growers irked by non-payment of their dues and sluggish retail sales incinerated unsold raw jute in front of a government procurement centre recently in the Mahimagani area of Gobindaganj upazila in Gaibandha",,2013-09-21 00:00:00,"Jute growers irked by non-payment of their dues and sluggish retail sales incinerated unsold raw jute in front of a government procurement centre recently in the Mahimagani area of Gobindaganj upazila in Gaibandha.

The symbolic protest, which was preceded by a demonstration, came at a time when plummeting jute prices became a matter of concern both for the growers and traders as well as the procurement centres.

The centre in front of which Tuesday’s protest took place was launched on August 6 this year by Bangladesh Jute Mills Cooperation, with the aim to purchase jute from farmers.

Initially, the arrangement worked as the procurement managers purchased Tk13m worth of jute from the growers and midlevel traders. Each maund (40kg) of jute was purchased at TK1400-1500 depending on quality.

The farmers were happy to be able to reap desired profits after a good harvest, but soon cracks began to appear in the arrangement mainly because of a sharp decline in sale because of poor consumer response. At present, each maund of jute is selling at TK 900-800 at the Mahimaganj Bazaar as the wholesalers say “there are not enough customers.”

Farmers who sold their produces to the procurement centres are failing to recover their outstanding payments because the latter are failing to sell them at expected prices.

Irked farmers are seen crowding the centres with the hope of repayment almost every day, and going back frustrated.

M Jahed Hossain, a farmer who was present at the protest, said he had sold 20 maunds of jute to the procurement centre in mid-August but did not yet get any money for that.

“Lack of customers at the local markets and unpaid dues have intensified the sufferings of all jute growers like me,” he added.

Several other farmers also expressed similar discontents and warned they would go for “tougher movements” if the authorities concerned do not take urgent steps to make payments.

M Khairul Islam, who is in charge of the jute procurement centre in Mahimagani, said he had sent a letter to the higher authorities seeking TK13m to clear the debts. “All dues of the growers and traders would be paid as soon as we have the money.”

However, growers and traders also urged the government to take necessary steps to increase the prices of jute without delay.","['farmers', 'tk13m', 'growers', 'jute', 'dues', 'traders', 'centre', 'irked', 'steps', 'protest', 'symbolic', 'procurement', 'burn']","Jute growers irked by non-payment of their dues and sluggish retail sales incinerated unsold raw jute in front of a government procurement centre recently in the Mahimagani area of Gobindaganj upazila in Gaibandha.

Superbugs linked to 80% of deaths in Bangladeshi ICUs,"Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistance",Tribune Desk,2019-04-24 00:00:00,"Representational photo: Bigstock

Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial resistant superbugs could be responsible for up to 80% of deaths in intensive care units (ICUs) in Bangladesh, a senior doctor has warned.

Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of Pharmacology Department at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), told the Telegraph that approximately 900 patients were admitted to the unit in 2018.

Of them, 400 died, he added.

Dr Sayedur said out of those deaths around 80% were attributed to a bacterial or fungal infection that was resistant to antibiotics, reports The Telegraph.

According to the article, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) because of: poor adherence to antibiotic treatment, the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals, self-medication, and illegal over-the-counter access to antibiotics.

The chairman of BSMMU’s Pharmacology Department said: ""Most patients [that die] come from public ICUs where there is strictly no AMR surveillance.

“And this is the generator of antibacterial resistance.""

He said: ""There should be more security...they [antibiotics] should not be available over the counter and others should only be dispensed at hospitals.""

According to a study published in the European Journal of Scientific Research, in 2015, over one-third of patients in Bangladesh surveyed were given antibiotics by people without authorization.

The Chairman of the BSMMU Microbiology Department, Prof Ahmed Abu Saleh told a Bangladeshi news daily that the situation was not like this about 10 years ago.

He said around 70% of deaths across all ICUs in Bangladesh could be put down to superbugs.

“Basically, there is no new antibiotic in the pipeline for future use. At the same time, the available antibiotic drugs are losing their effectiveness — which has made the scenario more dangerous,” Prof Ahmed said.

Around 10 million people could die, annually, by 2050 from AMR if effective measures are not taken regarding it, a report warned in 2016.

That figure is higher than the total number of people who died from cancer, diabetes, and diarrhoea in 2018.

Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally over time as microorganisms undergo genetic changes. As microorganisms evolve, antibiotics can become less effective at treating an infection.

In South Asia, the prescription of incorrect or poor quality medicine leads to antimicrobial resistance. In many countries, stringent controls over prescribing medicine to animals are not upheld.

Antibiotics intended for human use are also given to animals in a bid to fatten them quickly and thus generate more profit.

A study in Chittagong, found that over half of poultry chickens were infected with multi-drug resistant bacteria.

However, the emergence of AMR superbugs is not just a problem for South Asia, rather a worldwide issue.

A 2017 study in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases confirmed that the malaria parasite—in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam—had developed resistance to the artemisinin-based combination therapy prescribed to treat the disease.

Around the world, resistant strains of the HIV virus are thought to account for between 10% and 20% of infections and up to 40% of those are from re-starting medical treatment.","['resistance', 'study', 'superbugs', 'resistant', 'bangladesh', 'icus', 'department', 'patients', 'deaths', 'antibiotics', 'amr', '80', 'linked', 'bangladeshi']","Representational photo: BigstockBangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistanceAntimicrobial resistant superbugs could be responsible for up to 80% of deaths in intensive care units (ICUs) in Bangladesh, a senior doctor has warned.

BSF chief ditches drone reports,"<br />

        	India’s Border Security Force has no plans to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), popularly known as drone, along the Bangladesh border, its chief said Wednesday",Asif Showkat Kallol,2013-09-18 00:00:00,"India’s Border Security Force has no plans to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), popularly known as drone, along the Bangladesh border, its chief said Wednesday.

BSF Director General Shubhash Joshi also said he did not know why he had been attributed in a report run last week by Indian Express.

“We don’t know how it came. We immediately sent clarification through Press Trust of India [PTI] and it has been published. The BGB director general also clarified the matter several times he told it live on TV. I think it should have clarified whatever misgivings anybody may have,” he told journalists at Pilkhana.

He said they had not made any such plans. “We do not have any plans in the future to deploy any drones or any such thing.”

The five-day border co-ordination conference between BSF and BGB ended Wednesday. It was the 38th biannual meeting between the forces. The previous meeting was held in Delhi in March this year.

The Indian Express quoted the BSF chief saying that India was going to deploy drones along its borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to keep heightened vigil. Standard operating procedure was being drafted with the air force to finalise the modalities of using the UAVs.

Following this, the foreign ministry sought clarifications from New Delhi. Then Indian High Commissioner to Dhaka Pankaj Saran said he also had learnt of the BSF plans through media reports.

At the end of the conference, BGB chief Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed and his counterpart signed a joint record of discussions. Later they talked to the journalists.

Responding to a question on Felani issue, the BSF chief reiterated that there would be a revision of the trial. “This is a judicial process which is ongoing. The competent authorities went through the entire proceedings of the trial and ordered a revision. This will be done in due course.”

He hoped that justice would be ensured. “The Indian judicial system is much respected all over the world. We cannot interfere, but our intension is very clear. We shall ensure the justice,” he said.

On border killings, Joshi claimed that the BSF had been working to bring down the deaths at zero-level. “It’s a joint responsibility. The number of killings and incidents of injury along the border is coming down gradually,” he said, adding that the BSF investigated each incident. “Our intention is very transparent.”

He cited three incidents where their men were sentenced to death for killing innocent people along the border, but claimed that their men open fire for self defence as “according to the Indian law, every citizen has the right of self defence.”

Asked whether unarmed Felani was a threat to the BSF soldiers, Joshi said this particular incident was “different” and it went for trial.

BGB chief Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed said: “We have decided to aware people of both countries not to cross the international border. Both the forcers will motivate its field-level personnel to stop unusual firing and to implement other issues which have been agreed.”

He said killings and torture along border had affected the bilateral relationship.

Earlier, the BGB chief earlier read out a written statement of issues they agreed upon. It reads: The Bangladesh side expressed its deep concern over the issues of killing, injury and beating of Bangladeshi nationals along the border. The Indian side also voiced deep concern over similar incidents. Both sides agreed that the incidents of death and loss of lives on the border were extremely unfortunate and regrettable, and agreed to take all possible measures to bring down the death toll further.

To prevent movement of criminals, smugglers and insurgents across the international boundary, they agreed to increase coordinated patrolling.

They also agreed to hold more meetings between the field-level functionaries and share real time intelligence. On security related issues, both the sides decided to adopt multiple channels of communication between the commanders at the root-level for quick and timely decisions.

The two frontiers agreed to continue close cooperation, including sharing of intelligence and interrogation report on traffickers’ details to prevent smuggling of fake currency and drugs.

It was also decided to complete the joint verification of unfenced patches at the earliest.","['killings', 'issues', 'reports', 'indian', 'incidents', 'border', 'bsf', 'agreed', 'bgb', 'ditches', 'chief', 'drone', 'plans']","The Indian Express quoted the BSF chief saying that India was going to deploy drones along its borders with Bangladesh and Pakistan to keep heightened vigil.
Then Indian High Commissioner to Dhaka Pankaj Saran said he also had learnt of the BSF plans through media reports.
At the end of the conference, BGB chief Maj Gen Aziz Ahmed and his counterpart signed a joint record of discussions.
Responding to a question on Felani issue, the BSF chief reiterated that there would be a revision of the trial.
On border killings, Joshi claimed that the BSF had been working to bring down the deaths at zero-level."
Dhaka cut off from rest of the country,"The opposition leaders highly condemn the move calling it a conspiracy of the government to foil their Dhaka March programme

Some of the transport owners claimed they took the decision for the sake of safety of the passengers while some said they were instructed from the higher authority to do so.

The opposition leaders highly condemned the move calling it a conspiracy of the government to foil their Dhaka March programme.

Barisal

Bus communication between Dhaka and Barisal has been suspended since Friday morning.

Aftab Hossain, president of city Sramik League and Barisal Bus Owners Association, said operation of Dhaka-bound passenger buses from Barisal and other parts of the region has been stopped from 11:30am on Friday.

Fearing loss of properties and lives, the transport owners and workers had declared to halt operations of the Dhaka-bound buses until further notice.

Hours after the suspension of bus service, launch services from Barisal to Dhaka have been suspended since Friday evening.

The passengers of four triple-deck launches at Barisal river port were asked to leave the vessels by law enforcing agencies around 6:30pm, reports our Barisal correspondent.

Md Selim, supervisor of Parabat launch fleet, said: “Officials of law enforcing agencies ordered us to suspend operations and forced passengers on board to leave the vessels.”

Dhaka-bound water transports had pre-reservation system for cabin passengers therefore the passengers were well-informed about the situation, said Rintu, owner of Dhaka-bound triple-decker launch MV Sundarban.

However, Barisal district administration and port authorities said they were not directed for restricting movement of Dhaka-bound transports.

The respective transport owners associations might decide on the movement of their vehicles, said Md Shahidullah, Barisal port officer.

Condemning the move of transport owners, Kamrul Ahsan Shahin, city BNP secretary, said the government had been opposing BNP’s blockade programmes so far.

“Now they are trying to foil our programme to prevent the ’mass upsurge.’ However, such moves would not save them from toppling,” said the BNP leader.

Aminur Rahman and Selina Begum, two Dhaka-bound passengers expressed anxiety over the suspension of Dhaka-bound buses from Barisal.

They said thousands of passengers had preparations according to their preplanned schedule. Many had urgent official works on December 29 as it was a Sunday. Now they have to suffer and go through losses.

Jhenaidah

Dhaka-bound passenger buses remained on halt for an indefinite period since Friday afternoon following the Jumma prayer. Twenty-seven buses scheduled for Dhaka from Jhenaidah returned money to their passengers who arrived at the counters to make the journey.

Staffs at the ticket counters said a sub-inspector from the Jhenaidah police station, following order of the higher authority, had advised them to refrain from setting off buses for Dhaka.

Jhenaidah Bus-Minibus Owners’ Association sources said they had been operating coaches.

Some coach owners said Sub-Inspector Milon had suggested them to shut the counters in the afternoon considering the Dhaka march of the opposition alliance.

However, Sub-Inspector Milon denied the acclaim and said he did not make any such order to the coach owners.

Superintendent of Police Altaf Hossain said the owners of the buses might stop their operations as per order from the government, however, police was not involved with any such direction, he claimed.

Meherpur

Ahead of the opposition’s programme “March for Democracy,” the transport owners, particularly Dhaka-bound passenger couches in Meherpur went on a strike in support to the government since Friday.

Usually 40 passenger couches leave for Dhaka from Meherpur every day, however, no couches left for Dhaka from the district since yesterday late afternoon without any prior notice.

As a result, hundreds of passengers remained stranded on the stations.

They alleged that they had fallen victims of such unethical and irresponsible decision taken by the authorities. Abdur Rashid of Monoharpur village under sadar upazila purchased four tickets from Meherpur JR counter on Thursday for going to Dhaka yesterday.

After reaching the counter with family members including woman and children amid the chilling cold, he got to know that departure of all the Dhaka-bound coaches had been cancelled.

Golam Rasul, president of upazila AL unit and general secretary of Meherpur Bus-Minibus Owners’ Association, said for the sake of security of the passengers they decided not to run the vehicles.

AKM Nahidul Islam said police did not intervene in their decision regarding suspension of the vehicles and it was completely an internal affair.

Masud Arun, former BNP law maker blamed the government for hatching a conspiracy for foiling the “March for Democracy” programme.

Sylhet

All kinds of long-route Dhaka-bound buses from Sylhet remained at a halt since Friday.

City BNP President MA Haque said leaders of the 18-party alliance willing to participate in the March, were facing trouble.

“Leaders could not reserve any bus. But they would participate in the programme overcoming all hurdles,” he added.

Additional Deputy Police Commissioner of Sylhet Metropolitan Police Mohammad Aiyub said: “Police has not given any such orders. No written or unwritten orders were issued to suspend the long-route buses.”

However, Secretary of Dhaka-Sylhet Luxury Coach Road Sromik Union Md Tera Mia said: “We received an oral instruction in this regard.”

Police had been deployed in the central bus terminal in Dakshin Surma upazila since yesterday morning. The ticket sellers were instructed for not selling eight to 10 tickets at a time, he added.

He alleged that different petrol pumps were closed down since yesterday afternoon.

IOC vows 'toughest sanctions' after report finds Moscow ran broad doping scheme,IOC did not spell out whether it would heed growing calls for Olympic bans already imposed on Russia's athletes to be extended to all its competitors in Rio,Reuters,2016-07-19 00:00:00,"With the Rio Olympics less than three weeks away, the IOC on Monday promised ""the toughest sanctions available"" after a report found Moscow had concealed hundreds of positive doping tests in many sports ahead of the Sochi winter Games.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not spell out whether it would heed growing calls for Olympic bans already imposed on Russia's track and field athletes and weightlifters to be extended to all its competitors in Rio.

However, IOC President Thomas Bach said the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) investigation had revealed ""a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games.

The IOC Executive Board is to hold a telephone conference on Tuesday to take its first decisions, which may include provisional measures and sanctions with regard to the Rio Olympics.

""Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated.""

WADA itself explicitly urged the IOC to consider banning Russia from the Rio Olympics altogether.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who staked his reputation on the Sochi Games, the costliest in history, said the WADA-backed report was the result of political interference and that the Olympic movement could now split.

The report confirmed allegations made by Grigory Rodchenkov, former head of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory.

He told the New York Times two months ago that dozens of Russians had used performance-enhancing drugs in Sochi with the support not only of national sports authorities but even the domestic intelligence service, the FSB.

Monday's report said Russia, a traditional sporting superpower, had been stung into action by its performance at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, where it finished 11th, with only three gold medals.

""The surprise result of the Sochi investigation was the revelation of the extent of State oversight and directed control of the Moscow Laboratory in processing and covering up urine samples of Russian athletes from virtually all sports before and after the Sochi Games,"" said the report, unveiled in Toronto.

""FAILSAFE STRATEGY""

The investigation was led by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren, who sat on the independent commission that last year exposed doping and corruption in Russian track and field, leading to its exclusion from international competition.

The report said Deputy Sports Minister Yuri Nagornykh had been advised of every positive test across all sports from 2011 onwards and decided ""who would benefit from a cover up and who would not be protected.

""The State implemented a simple failsafe strategy,"" it said. ""If all the operational precautions to promote and permit doping by Russian athletes proved to have been ineffective for whatever reason, the laboratory provided a failsafe mechanism.

""The State had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow Laboratory be altered.""

Among the hundreds of samples that disappeared were 35 from Paralympic athletes.

In Sochi itself, where international observers were scrutinising the drug tests, positive results could not simply be brushed away, so the FSB developed a method of opening urine bottles to allow samples to be swapped undetected.

Rodchenkov spoke of a clandestine night-time operation in which staff secretly took samples from the lab via a ""mouse hole"" cut into a wall, and replaced them with clean samples taken from the same athlete months earlier and sometimes manipulated.

""CREDIBLE WITNESSES""

McLaren said Rodchenkov and all other witnesses interviewed had been deemed credible, and the report said the investigators ""confirm the general veracity of the published information concerning the sample swapping that went on at the Sochi Laboratory during the Sochi Games"".

The investigations showed that caps had been removed from a number of samples, and that they contained unusually high levels of salt, ""significantly exceeding the levels produced by the human body"".

Nagornykh and Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was mentioned 21 times in McLaren's 97-page report, were not immediately available for comment.

Putin said in a statement that there was ""no place for doping in sport"", and that the officials named in the report would be suspended.

Following the statement, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev suspended Deputy Sports Minister Nagornykh.

Putin also said the allegations were based on the testimony of only one man, and were an attempt to ""make sport an instrument of geopolitical pressure, to form a negative image of countries and peoples"".

Harking back to the tit-for-tat superpower boycotts of the 1980s, he said: ""The Olympic movement ... may again be on the verge of a split.""

In a leaked draft letter intended to be sent to the IOC on Monday, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) CEO Travis Tygart called for a ban on all Russian athletes, not only in track and field.

Paul Melia, head of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports, said the letter was backed by various athletes' committees and the anti-doping organisations of the United States, Germany, Japan and New Zealand, among others.

However, Russian track and field athletes have appealed against their ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is due to rule by Thursday.

If it finds in their favour, there would seem to be little chance of a wider ban on Russian competitors holding up.

Bach had indicated last week that he was reluctant to see athletes from one sport punished for the crimes of athletes or officials from another.","['report', 'positive', 'track', 'olympic', 'moscow', 'scheme', 'finds', 'sport', 'athletes', 'sochi', 'ran', 'toughest', 'doping', 'samples', 'ioc', 'vows', 'sanctions', 'russian']","""Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated.""

BMET to lift ban on immigration clearance for Maldives,"Officials say most of the workers went to Maldives without BMET immigration clearance though it was mandatory
        	The government has decided to lift ban on immigration clearance for the labour market of Maldives as Bangladeshi migrant workers are getting jobs there",Rabiul Islam,2013-11-18 00:00:00,"The government has decided to lift ban on immigration clearance for the labour market of Maldives as Bangladeshi migrant workers are getting jobs there.

“A delegation went to Maldives recently and found that our workers are all employed there. Following their report, we have decided to lift ban on immigration clearance soon,” Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training (BMET) Director General Begum Shamsun Nahar told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday.

On September 23, following an allegation that the migrant workers are not getting jobs in Maldives, the government temporarily suspended the immigration clearance.

Earlier, while talking to the Dhaka Tribune at his office, Bangladesh Migrant Welfare Society Executive Director Haroon-or-Rashid said a section of unscrupulous recruitment agencies sent workers to Maldives but after a few months they returned home finding no jobs there.

A two-member delegation led by deputy secretary of the Expatriates’ Welfare Ministry Badiur Rahman recently visited the Maldives to look into the problems of the workers.

Badiur Rahman told this correspondent that jobs were available for the Bangladeshi migrant workers in Maldives.

He said the wages in Maldives were low while the migration cost stood high.

A migrant worker has to spend around Tk2,00,000 to go to Maldives while he earns only between Tk12,000 and Tk15,000.

According to the Maldives government, about 80,000 Bangladeshi migrants were working there, but BMET data shows about 28,000 Bangladeshi workers have so far gone to the country since 1976.

Officials said most of the workers went to Maldives without BMET immigration clearance though it was mandatory.

“We asked our migrant workers in Maldives how they reached there. In reply, they said at first the middlemen brought us to airport and then we could easily cross the immigration,” Badiur told the correspondent.","['immigration', 'maldives', 'lift', 'jobs', 'clearance', 'told', 'ban', 'bmet', 'workers', 'went', 'migrant', 'bangladeshi']","The government has decided to lift ban on immigration clearance for the labour market of Maldives as Bangladeshi migrant workers are getting jobs there.

Impact of Branding & Technology in Banking,"An exclusive interview of Dan Mobley, Regional Head of Corporate Affairs, India & South Asia, Standard Chartered Dan was appointed Regional Head of Corporate Affairs for India & South Asia in September 2014, with responsibility for all corporate and staff communications, sustainability and community initiatives across our four South Asian markets (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal)",Tribune Report,2015-08-26 00:00:00,"Dan was appointed Regional Head of Corporate Affairs for India & South Asia in September 2014, with responsibility for all corporate and staff communications, sustainability and community initiatives across our four South Asian markets (India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal). Dan is based in Mumbai, India and manages a team of 21 people.

Previously Dan was Regional Head of Corporate Affairs for Africa between 2011 and 2014, based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Dan joined Standard Chartered in January 2008 as Group Head of Government Relations, based in London, and managed the Bank’s relations with the UK and US Governments, international institutions including the European Union, and led advocacy on public policy.

Before joining Standard Chartered, Dan spent eight years in the UK Treasury, advising Ministers on a variety of domestic and international policies. Dan has also worked for several environment and development NGOs (including six years as a non-executive director for a UK development education charity) and the United Nations Association

Q. Do you feel there can be a Company/platform like Airbnb or Uber to challenge the traditional approach of banking?

Dan Mobley: We have already seen the rise of exciting new technologies that are revolutionising aspects of banking, especially around retail payments. Often these have been driven by new entrants in developing countries who have cleverly adopted to local needs.

For example, Africa is seeing startups driving a huge up take of mobile banking: across the continent only around a quarter of the population has a formal bank account, yet in countries like Kenya an estimated 50% of the population are accessing financial services through their mobile phones. In India, companies like the Delhi based Beam allow customers to use their mobile phones to pay bills, buy train tickets and remit money to relatives, with transaction costs much lower than conventional banks. Technology will really help in the fight against financial exclusion.

But these services are mostly additional to, rather than replacing, traditional financial institutions. Banking and payment systems are, rightly, carefully regulated to prevent money laundering, fraud and other financial crimes which inevitably acts as a brake on the rise of new providers. In many cases, banks like Standard Chartered are already using digital and mobile technologies to improve our existing products and services and I’d expect many of the most exciting innovations – including ideas around using “big data” - to come from within the sector rather than outside.

Q. How important storytelling is for a Bank like Standard Chartered?

Dan Mobley: Story telling is everything. Banks have historically been very conventional in the way we try to reach our customers, with old fashioned advertising campaigns and press releases about new products. Even today, if you see a TV commercial or a print ad for a bank and cover the logo, they can seem interchangeable between competing banks! We try to use stories about the positive impact we have, whether on our customers, our staff or the communities we live and work in, to differentiate Standard Chartered. Our promise, to be “Here for good”, is all about the stories we tell ourselves and others about our values, our history and the people we are trying to help by being a well-run, responsible and progressive bank.

Q. How has your storytelling shifted over the years?

Dan Mobley: Our decision to rebrand as “Here for good” in 2010 was a pivotal moment for us. This was a bold claim to make when the terrible impact of the financial crisis was being felt worldwide, driven by some very unethical behaviour in parts of the industry, and the reputation of banks and bankers was at its lowest ebb. We wanted to show that banks can and do play a positive role in society. We wanted to capture the essence of Standard Chartered: what makes us different, what do we stand for? Can we be about more than just profit? What commitment can we give to be there for our customers through the bad times as well as the good? The very process of debating our brand generated huge numbers of stories about our history, our people, the places we operate and how we try to be different – many of which have then inspired our ad campaigns as well. These stories also act as a guide to our staff on how we expect them to do things the right way.

Here for good allows us to tell stories as diverse as: the support we gave to the people of Sierra Leone during the recent Ebola crisis, increasing our lending to local business with a new $50 million working capital facility; the 2 million people we have educated about HIV-AIDS worldwide through our “Living with HIV” programme; or the more than 1% of Bangladesh’s GDP that our business supports every year.

Q. How do you approach digital platform & social media to engage with the bank’s core essence – Here for Good?

Dan Mobley: Banks can be very conventional beasts! Many have struggled to come to grips with social media and what it might mean for how to promote and protect reputations. We use Facebook and Twitter to speak and listen to our customers directly as well as to tell stories we think might interest them. The most interesting aspect for me is when social media cuts through how you think you might be perceived and tells you how you really are viewed, positively and negatively. I’ve seen great examples where someone has criticised us on social media and other customers, without any interference from us, have come to our defence, citing great customer service or some of our community projects.

Social media also stops us getting complacent – these conversations about us are happening whether we engage or not. There’s simply no point turning ostrich and burying one’s head in the sand of press releases and ad campaigns if there is a very different debate going on online about your brand by your customers. Reflecting the shift in corporate communications in the digital age, we have also recently launched our own content hub called Beyond Borders (https://www.sc.com/BeyondBorders/) to house our own publications, opinion pieces, infographics and videos.

The idea behind this “brand journalism” is not to churn out corporate propaganda about our business but instead to showcase expertise and insight in topical issues, in a way that we hope will grab the attention of our clients, staff and potential new hires, journalists, commentators, regulators and governments.

Q. In today’s open information age, people search for transparency. They want to validate any message/campaign with the actual behaviour of the Bank & its people. How do you drive this part?

Dan Mobley: Nothing generates cynicism faster than hypocrisy, so we strive to live our talk in everything we do. All banks are ultimately just people, a few buildings and some IT. While we can make incremental improvements to our infrastructure, it is only really through our people that we will set ourselves apart from the competition so we work hard to ensure our staff discuss, debate and understand what Here for good tries to encapsulate. We have extensive training programmes covering good conduct and what kind of business we want to do and – more importantly – what kind of business we will turn away. We have published and regularly update on our website our 20 “position statements” on sensitive sectors related to environmental and social issues and all our relationship managers have to pass training courses on how to apply these rules. We have also shared our internal policies on how we deal with clients and staff in order to prevent bribery and corruption, money laundering or to promote diversity and inclusion, human rights or health and safety. Ultimately, having the best trained, highly motivated and well trained people working for us is the best safeguard for our reputation and brand.

Q. What would be your advice to professionals in the banking industry?

Dan Mobley: First, challenge conventional thinking in what a banking brand really means – it should not be a slogan or a sales pitch but something that tries to encapsulate the culture, history and promise that a business offers to all those with a stake in its operations. Banks and banking can be boring and conventional but they don’t have to be! Second, marketing matters as much within an organisation as it does outside. If your people don’t believe in your brand they won’t try to promote and protect your reputation. Finally, despite its battered reputation following the Western financial crisis, banking can and does play a vital role in the world. Good, well run banks drive the trade, investment and growth that will alleviate poverty, create employment, sustain vital tax revenues, fight financial crime and much more. We professionals in the industry have a responsibility to rebuild banking’s reputation as a force for good in society – we can find, shape and tell the stories that explain this essential role.

In the session he will be sharing his experience on branding, banking and the impact of technology.

Does BNP have a future?,"The BNP needs to understand the challenges we face today and they must also look at our history if they are to restructure their party wellThe media is agog about where the BNP stands after the indefinite blockade and three city corporation elections, and what their next plans will be",Muhammad Quamrul Islam,2015-05-21 00:00:00,"The media is agog about where the BNP stands after the indefinite blockade and three city corporation elections, and what their next plans will be. Apparently, they will now buy time to reorganise their party from top to bottom before announcing their next course of action!

Supporters of the BNP repeat the same arguments, especially in front of foreigners, telling them the same old stories and hiding their failure to participate in the last national election and their defeats in the city corporation elections. On the contrary, pro-AL groups are countering them as usual, but they seem to want to keep BNP as their main opponent for many different reasons, particularly to face religious militants. What then, does the future hold for BNP?

The general public is probably not thinking about it, especially since they have just cast their votes at the city corporation elections and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already gotten the public’s confidence. It goes without saying that she has the capability, experience and courage to take appropriate decisions, without waiting for anybody’s advice. The same cannot be said for BNP Chairperson and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia. She is quite dependent on those around her.

Even when news about the sufferings human traffickers are inflicting on the poor innocent Bangladeshis crammed on boats are being widely reported in the media, the BNP chooses to completely ignore it. The government is doing its part but the opposition has responsibilities too. But in Bangladesh, the opposition lacks credibility and is only concerned about their position and power.

It is painful to see how politics has stooped so low. It was different in the 1960s when we attended Dhaka University. We did not hesitate to leave behind our comfortable lives to join the 1960s movements leading to the emergence of independent Bangladesh in 1971.

We were lead by leaders like Bhashani and Mujib and we respected them notwithstanding which student organisation we belonged to or which party we later decided to side with. We were in the then largest student organisation erstwhile EPSU and later liked the ideology of National Awami Party (NAP), which became part of the mainstream Awami League when Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared his six-point demand in 1966.

Back then student politics was not what it is today. Those were simpler times. I still remember how much more affectionate people were in those days. More democratic and vibrant too. The spirited politics of our time lost its appeal when Bangabandhu was tragically killed on August 15, 1975.

A lot of communist parties came to the political scene but were not able to exercise much influence. In this melee, under the leadership of Ziaur Rahman, a nationalist front was constituted on May 7, 1978. Its partners were Jatiyatabadi Ganotantrik Dal (Jagdal), Bhashani NAP (Moshiur), UPP, Bangladesh Muslim League, and Tafsil Federation.

After Zia became president, the front was abolished and the BNP was formed on September 1, 1978. He became chairman, and the manifesto of the party was declared by Dr AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury. Some critics said that it was no party at all, but an amalgam of opportunists. Over the years, some AL leaders also joined the BNP and Jatiya Party, which was set up by General Ershad after ousting elected President Sattar in a military coup.

This is how power mongering was introduced to the political scene and the ideologies of AL and NAP were put aside. Ershad debased the electoral process and sowed the seeds of corruption that we are still fighting today.

The political integrity of the land was then redeemed when the AL and the BNP launched a united democratic movement and Ershad was forced to step down on December 6, 1990.

But parliamentary elections held on February 27, 1991, had many limitations. It was held without updating voter lists and Ershad’s party members came back to power by winning seats through manipulating local voters and creating support in dubious ways.

The democratic period started from 1991. It was, however, interrupted by the caretaker government, which is a system that has no democratic value or basis and is unheard of in other parts of the world. It resulted in the dissolution of the parliament and hindered democratic morality and developments.

The crisis in student politics continued unabated and issues were never properly addressed. The teachers and university authorities took partisan lines and contributed little to the dynamism of campus politics.

The government allowed private universities in 1992, and they mushroomed everywhere. But unfortunately, even authorities at private universities started wearing party labels.

The BNP needs to understand the challenges we face today and they must also look at our history if they are to restructure their party well. I am sure if they leave their power hungry ways and dedicate themselves to the cause of the country, the PM will not hesitate to help them. But they will not get any support from the people if they continue with their ambitious and abhorrent ways. Bangladeshis will not tolerate it.","['does', 'political', 'bnp', 'party', 'power', 'ershad', 'future', 'democratic', 'politics', 'elections', 'nap', 'student']","The media is agog about where the BNP stands after the indefinite blockade and three city corporation elections, and what their next plans will be.
What then, does the future hold for BNP?
The same cannot be said for BNP Chairperson and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia.
Back then student politics was not what it is today.
The crisis in student politics continued unabated and issues were never properly addressed."

Bangladesh condemns attack

A Bangladeshi man with a homemade bomb strapped to his body set off an explosion at a New York commuter hub during rush hour on Monday, wounding himself and three others in what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called an attempted terrorist attack. The suspect in the incident at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, a block from Times Square, was identified as Akayed Ullah, the New York Police Department commissioner said. The suspect had burns and lacerations while three other people, including a police officer, sustained minor injuries. The bomber is in serious condition at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. [caption id=""attachment_233456"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""] The injured Bangladeshi suicide bomber is seen on the ground after being tackled by New York policeman at the Port Authority Bus Terminal subway station on Monday, December 12, 2017[/caption] Akayed Ullah is from of Chittagong and is a US resident, said Bangladesh’ Inspector General of Police AKM Shahidul Hoque. He had no criminal record there and last visited Bangladesh on September 8, Shahidul Hoque said. According to witnesses, the man partially detonated the device, which he was carrying under the right side of his jacket, prematurely inside the station. US President Donald Trump was briefed on the explosion, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders wrote on Twitter.Ullah had a black cab/limousine driver's license from 2012 to 2015, after which it expired, the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission said. The weapon was based on a pipe bomb and fixed to the suspect with zip ties and velcro, police said. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, speaking at a news conference near the site, described the device as ""amateur-level."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told the same news conference that the incident, which happened at the start of the city's rush hour, was ""an attempted terrorist attack."" ""As New Yorkers our lives revolve around the subways. When we hear of an attack in the subways, it is incredibly unsettling,"" de Blasio said. New York City was a target, said John Miller, deputy police commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Miller cited the attacks of September 11, 2001, that killed more than 2,750 people in New York and nearly 3,000 people total; and the World Trade Center bombing of February 26, 1993, which killed six people. ""In the course of the post-9/11 world, as you are aware, there's also been approximately 26 plots that we can talk about that have been prevented through intelligence, investigation and intervention."" The incident was captured on security video, police said. Video posted on nypost.com showed smoke and a man lying in the tunnel that connects sections of the Times Square subway station and the bus station. A photograph showed a man lying facedown, with tattered clothes and burns on his torso. The bus terminal was temporarily shut down and a large swath of midtown Manhattan was closed to traffic. Subway train service returned to normal after earlier disruptions. WABC reported the suspect was in his 20s and that he has been in the United States for seven years and has an address in New York's Brooklyn borough. Police shut down the entire block and there was a heavy police presence outside the home. [embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q2I_DFq3Sg&feature=youtu.be[/embed]The Bangladesh embassy in Washington DC has reiterated the government’s “zero tolerance” policy against terrorism after the media reported the suspect in the New York explosion is a Bangladeshi. “A terrorist is a terrorist irrespective of his or her ethnicity or religion, and must be brought to justice,” reads a statement released by the embassy. “Government of Bangladesh is committed to its declared policy of 'Zero Tolerance' against terrorism, and condemns terrorism and violent extremism in all forms or manifestations anywhere in the world, including Monday morning's incident in New York City.” New York in December sees a surge of visitors who come to see elaborate store displays, the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Broadway shows. More than 200,000 people use the Times Square station, the city's busiest, each weekday, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The incident rippled through American financial markets, briefly weakening equity markets as they were starting trading for the week and giving a modest lift to safe-haven assets such as US Treasuries. S&P 500 index emini futures dipped in the moments after the initial reports of an explosion, but major stock indexes later opened slightly higher. The incident occurred less than two months after an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people by speeding a rental truck down a New York City bike path, in an attack for which Islamic State claimed responsibility.","['station', 'explosion', 'man', 'bangladesh', 'responsible', 'suspect', 'bus', 'york', 'city', 'terrorist', 'incident', 'bangladeshi', 'manhattan']","According to witnesses, the man partially detonated the device, which he was carrying under the right side of his jacket, prematurely inside the station.

FBI failed to act on tip accused Florida gunman wanted to kill,"Wednesday's shooting ranks as the greatest loss of life from school gun violence since the 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 first-graders and six adult educators dead",Reuters,2018-02-17 00:00:00,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday said it mishandled a January tip that the 19-year-old accused of killing 17 people in Florida had guns and the potential to carry out a school shooting. A person close to accused gunman Nikolas Cruz called an FBI tip line on January 5 to report concerns about him, the FBI said in a statement. ""The caller provided information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behaviour, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting,"" it said. The tip appeared unrelated to a previously reported YouTube comment in which a person named Nikolas Cruz said, ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" The FBI has acknowledged getting that tip as well but failing to connect it to Cruz, who is accused of carrying out the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Wednesday with an AR-15-style assault rifle. ""Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life,"" the FBI said in its statement. ""The information then should have been forwarded to the FBI Miami field office, where appropriate investigative steps would have been taken. We have determined that these protocols were not followed."" The second-deadliest shooting at a public school in US history also raised concerns about potential failures in school security and stirred the ongoing US debate about gun rights, which are protected by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. ""We are still investigating the facts,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in the statement. ""We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy."" Leaders including US President Donald Trump have linked mental illness to Wednesday's violence, suggesting that it was the public's responsibility to warn officials of such dangers. ""So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,"" Trump said in a Thursday tweet. ""Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!"" Cruz, who had been expelled from the school where he allegedly staged his attack for undisclosed disciplinary reasons, made a brief court appearance on Thursday and was ordered held without bond. ""He's a broken human being,"" his lawyer, public defender Melissa McNeill, told reporters. ""He's sad, he's mournful, he's remorseful."" Wednesday's shooting ranks as the greatest loss of life from school gun violence since the 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that left 20 first-graders and six adult educators dead. News of the FBI's mishandling of the last month's tip about Cruz came as families of the 17 victims began to bury their dead. The first two funerals were for Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, a high school athlete and Meadow Pollack, an 18-year-old senior who had been headed to Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida. Brian Gately, a friend of the Alhadeff family, said he attended Alyssa's funeral and that the synagogue was so packed he had to stand in the rear. ""There was just really a lot of sadness in there,"" Gately, a 51-year-old financial adviser who lives in Parkland said. The burial became more emotional, he added, saying, ""People were yelling, 'No, no.' Kids were yelling, 'No, no.'"" Trump tweeted on Friday morning that he would leave for Florida later in the day to meet people whose ""lives had been totally shattered"" by the shooting. The vice mayor of Broward County, where the killings took place, blasted any visit by Trump, saying Republicans had failed to back common sense gun laws and had rolled back measures that made it harder for severely mentally ill people to buy weapons. ""Him coming here is absolutely absurd, and he's a hypocrite,"" Mark Bogen told CNN in an interview following Trump's tweet.","['tip', 'act', 'accused', 'potential', 'florida', 'fbi', 'failed', 'trump', 'gunman', 'hes', 'cruz', 'wanted', 'gun', 'kill', 'shooting', 'school']","The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday said it mishandled a January tip that the 19-year-old accused of killing 17 people in Florida had guns and the potential to carry out a school shooting.

In a statement last week, Myanmar Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Win Myat Aye hinted that a senior government official from the country will visit Bangladesh soon to discuss the Rohingya issue. However, according to South Asia Monitor, U Kyaw Tin has no plans to visit refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar.

The refugees narrated horrific tales of mass murder, arson, beheadings, rapes and torture perpetrated by the Myanmar army. Earlier, a BBC report published on Thursday confirmed that the Myanmar authorities have postponed a scheduled UN visit to northern Rakhine to assess the situation there. The UN had earlier termed the ongoing situation as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” UN Secretary General António Guterres has urged Myanmar authorities to immediately end military operations against the Rohingya, calling the crisis “the world’s fastest developing refugee emergency and a humanitarian and human rights nightmare.” This article was first published on Bangla Tribune","['south', 'minister', 'tin', 'myanmar', 'kyaw', 'tribune', 'state', 'visit', 'rohingya', 'crisis', 'dhaka', 'foreign']","Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar U Kyaw Tin is set to arrive in Dhaka on Sunday, amid increasing international criticism over the Rohingya crisis.

Bangladesh sweat it out ahead of Sri Lanka Tests,Bangladesh team started training after a 10-day break in Mirpur’s Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Friday ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka,Ali Shahriyar Amin,2017-02-24 00:00:00,"Earlier last Tuesday, Bangladesh Cricket Board announced the 16-man squad for the two-match Test series. Thirteen players took part in the training session while the other three members – Tamim Iqbal, Shakib al Hasan and Mahmudullah – are currently busy with the 2017 PSL T20 for their respective franchises. Training started with a gym session in the morning. Test skipper Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehedi Hasan Miraz sweated it out in the gym session and did running session separately. Later, the training session was followed by net session in the afternoon. Bangladesh have five pacers for the Sri Lanka Tests. Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha set markers on the pitch and the four pacemen - Mustafizur Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Subashish Roy and Taskin Ahmed - bowled for long sessions. Hathurusingha made them bowl on low and slow tracks in order to familiarise themselves as the wickets in Sri Lanka are expected to be the same. The other pace bowler Kamrul Islam Rabbi did not bowl but did some batting practice. All eyes were on Mustafizur as the star paceman has returned to the Test squad after a long injury lay-off. The left arm pacer looked comfortable and in good rhythm during the first day of practice. Strength and conditioning coach Mario Villavarayan informed that Mustafizur is in good shape and is ready to return to longer version cricket. “He played BCL (Bangladesh Cricket League) recently. He bowled well there. From my point of view, he is fit now,” Villavarayan told the media. Opening batsman Imrul Kayes, who missed the lone India Test, was overlooked for the Sri Lanka five-dayers. However, if the opener proves his match fitness soon, he can be considered for the second and final Test. “Imrul is doing his rehab. He is doing his running sessions at the moment. I think he has to play another BCL game. We will asses him after that. If everything goes well for Imrul then he can be considered for the second Test,” said Villavarayan. The Tigers will attend another day-long practice session on Saturday before leaving for Sri Lanka this Monday. Bangladesh will begin their first bilateral tour of Sri Lanka since 2013 with a two-day warm-up game against local opposition, starting this Thursday in Moratuwa. The two-match Test series begins in Galle on March 7 while the second five-dayer will be held in Colombo’s P Sara Oval, starting March 15.","['test', 'training', 'tests', 'sri', 'villavarayan', 'bangladesh', 'second', 'session', 'practice', 'sweat', 'mustafizur', 'lanka', 'ahead']","Bangladesh have five pacers for the Sri Lanka Tests.
