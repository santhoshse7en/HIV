Like a phoenix: living with HIV for 32 years,"It was the hottest day of summer Europe ever experienced in the the last 40 years and I was eagerly waiting to meet Mr. Haerry David from Switzerland, co-author for www.hivrestrictions.org.",Dr Maruf Hasan,2018-11-18T00:00:00+06:00,"It was the hottest day of summer Europe ever experienced in the the last 40 years and I was eagerly waiting to meet Mr. Haerry David from Switzerland, co-author for www.hivrestrictions.org. We were there to talk about decriminalisation and restrictions on people living with HIV in many countries. Haerry David has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for the last 32 years. He is a survivor living with HIV for the highest number of years, ever encountered by me. Surprisingly, I found Bangladesh besides the Middle East, China and Malaysia, who deport HIV infected people as soon as they are detected during their stay, and puts restriction on any kind of visit for those who are already detected. So I decided to share David's story to know more about HIV with breaking barriers and building bridges in his own words.“The result was positive. It took me six months to make up my mind and I went to the hospital for screening”, said Mr Haerry.  “Two to three years, maybe more, maybe less”, my physician told me about my life expectancy. They wanted to give me antiretroviral medication with very bad side effects. I walked away from the premises with many uncertainties.Later on, I focused on my career and until I fell very sick in 1996. I was losing hope as I lost 30 kgs rapidly, having Kaposi sarcoma along with atypical tuberculosis. In 1996 specific treatment for HIV arrived which worked really well for me. I managed my way facing so many side effects and today I have an advanced regime of Integrase inhibitors, Nevirapine and Abacavir.After my diagnosis was made positive, I worked for 10 years like a normal person but quit my job in 1996. I worked while I already had HIV and at the time had an entry restriction to the USA and I had to go there twice a year as a Swiss businessman. I was very nervous while I was receiving treatments. I started repacking my treatment as vitamins to get customs clearance. When I could not work anymore, I said to my friends that we should establish a database of the countries where we are not allowed to travel. That is when a database was established. So far we have touched a few landmarks. The most prominent government that repealed the restrictions was USA, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.We believe the person with or without HIV should have access to the health system in the country where s/he lives, like anybody else who has any kind of health issue. If you have diabetes and you go abroad, you are treated abroad. So people with HIV should be treated the same.

London HIV patient becomes world's second AIDS cure hope,"An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors say.",,2019-03-05T16:41:04+06:00,"An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors said.	Almost three years after receiving bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after coming off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the man's previous HIV infection.	""There is no virus there that we can measure. We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.	The case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, the doctors said, but does not mean a cure for HIV has been found.	Gupta described his patient as ""functionally cured"" and ""in remission"", but cautioned: ""It's too early to say he's cured.""	The man is being called ""the London patient"", in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV.	Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free.	Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients.	Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called Hodgkin's Lymphoma.LAST CHANCE	In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him. ""This was really his last chance of survival,"" Gupta told Reuters in an interview.	The donor - who was unrelated - had a genetic mutation known as 'CCR5 delta 32', which confers resistance to HIV.	The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of ""graft-versus-host"" disease - a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipient's immune cells.	Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people — most of them of northern European descent — who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus.	Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key - or whether the graft versus host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said.	Sharon Lewin, an expert at Australia's Doherty Institute and co-chair of the International AIDS Society's cure research advisory board, told Reuters the London case points to new avenues for study.	""We haven't cured HIV, but (this) gives us hope that it's going to be feasible one day to eliminate the virus,"" she said.	Gupta said his team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. ""We need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,"" he said.	The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['second', 'donor', 'case', 'patient', 'london', 'aids', 'man', 'worlds', 'gupta', 'virus', 'hope', 'hiv', 'cure', 'doctors', 'known']","We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

Living with HIV: a fight to the death,"Little Akib was in the last stages of advanced AIDS. A boy of 12, he looked six years old and was all skin and bones. He breathed his last on Sunday night. “He was fine this morning, talking and getting ready. I fed him as usual,” said his nani.",Maliha Khan,2017-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Little Akib was in the last stages of advanced AIDS. A boy of 12, he looked six years old and was all skin and bones. He breathed his last on Sunday night. “He was fine this morning, talking and getting ready. I fed him as usual,” said his nani. She has now watched both her daughter and her grandson die of the deadly disease that is AIDS.Akib was diagnosed almost three years ago. He wouldn't let it get him down though. Akib would come himself, every month or so, all the way from Gazipur where he lived with his grandmother, to collect his medicine from the hospital in Dhaka. “Whereas I should be the one bringing him for treatment, he would bring me, because he knows his way around the city and knows his letters,” said his grandmother. Akib lay beside her, unable to talk or move. His mother had died of AIDS two years ago and his father too has advanced AIDS.Two months ago, he caught tuberculosis (TB) as well and this, in addition to the HIV virus, combined to weaken him substantially. For those with HIV, the immune system is suppressed, making it harder to fight off other infections. TB is responsible for the most deaths among people with HIV.His counsellor at Ashar Alo Society (a local NGO), Azhar Hossain, says that Akib should have been hospitalised after he caught TB. A wilful child, however, Akib refused to stay in the hospital and would always go back to his grandmother. “We couldn't enforce that he took the TB or the antiretroviral (ARV) medication regularly at home. Try as we would, he just wouldn't stay at the hospital,” said Hossain.Of the 11,700 adults and children presently living with HIV in Bangladesh (as of 2016), only 2,475 are on ARV therapy. Many remain unaware of their HIV-positive status. Within the last year, almost 1,000 died as a result of AIDS and new infections amounted to 1,500. The figures for this year will be released by the government today, December 1—World AIDS Day.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Stigma runs deepThere remains a silence around the virus and disease and stigma runs deep, even among the HIV-positive themselves as well as in the medical community.Internalised stigma among those living with HIV/AIDS is not uncommon. A study by UNAIDS, Plan International, BRAC and others found that 68 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) felt ashamed and 54 percent felt guilty due to their HIV-positive status. Shame and guilt hinder their participation in social activities and lead to withdrawal from their communities.More worryingly, it can prevent them from going to the hospital for treatment. The same study found that 17.1 percent of males and 16.3 percent of females surveyed would not visit the hospital even when they needed to—to collect their medicines or to avail treatment—as a result of internalised stigma.Equally worrying is stigma from healthcare workers. PLHA are further discouraged from seeking treatment because of discrimination they face at hospitals and clinics. In a 2010 study which surveyed doctors, nurses, medical technicians and support staff, the results proved troubling. 47.9 percent of healthcare workers felt that those who have HIV/AIDS should not be allowed to mix freely with other people. A breakdown reveals that 21.9 percent of doctors, 48.1 percent of nurses and an overwhelming 83.3 percent of support staff felt this way. With direct caregivers displaying such attitudes, it is of little surprise that patients are discouraged from seeking out treatment.Testing and treatment are free. As are ARV drugs, which are distributed by the government and, until recently, by a few non-government organisations. PLHAs, especially those diagnosed late, require these medicines every day, for the rest of their lives. They can lead healthy lives as long as they take ARV drugs to control the infection and prevent transmitting the virus to others.The recent change in the distribution of the free ARV medication is a complication. Earlier, patients would get their drugs from NGOs and self-help groups, such as Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash Bangladesh, and Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP). These organisations have been working to provide counselling, psychosocial and medical support to PLHA across the country. Most of the staff themselves are people living with HIV.Since October this year, these drugs are now being distributed from six major hospitals around the country, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Dhaka. It however means that patients come from as far away as Comilla to get their supply of medicines once every two months.Sherin Akter says her husband, a businessman, is threatening to stop going to the hospital to pick up his HIV medication as the process is time-consuming and a hassle. Sherin and her husband are both HIV-positive and were diagnosed 11 years ago.The trouble is not just the usual troubles associated with accessing services at government hospitals. It is that the hospital environment itself is not hospitable for those with HIV/AIDS. Sherin, for example, went for a routine eye exam at BSMMU just last week but was forced to disclose her HIV-positive status to the doctor and nurse, crammed in with five other patients in the doctor's room.Whether or not to disclose her HIV-positive status in light of the discriminatory attitudes towards PLHA is not a light dilemma. Sherin disclosed it, thinking that her doctor ought to know before examining her. “It was so embarrassing, the doctor and nurse just stared for a long time, dumbstruck as to what to do. Everyone else was also staring at me,” she said.34-year-old Sherin has not yet informed her own family, except her younger sister, of her and her husband's HIV status. Her in-laws found out a few years ago when her husband was severely sick and had to be hospitalised. “It took them a while, but they soon came to terms with the situation,” she says. Their only daughter, 14, doesn't yet know. Sherin and her husband have discussed it, but feel that she should be a little older when she finds out that both her parents are HIV-positive. “We plan on telling her once she completes her HSC exams,” says Sherin.Sherin and her husband have faced discriminatory attitudes at hospitals. They have been denied or reluctantly given treatment at least four times because hospitals and doctors are not prepared to treat HIV-positive patients. Remaining silent about their status in public life is a given here, but should they also have to suffer stigma in a place where they are supposed to receive care?  Holistic care neededAs important as the medicine, is the counselling and psycho-social support required by PLHIV. Dr Saima Khan, UNAIDS country manager for Bangladesh, says “Four things are of essence—confidentiality, access to medicine and services, acceptance of their situation, and help in coping with their families.”Though one of these functions has now shifted to the government, the others remain lacking. Even in the case of medication, they may very well be free but there are hidden costs involved. There are only six hospitals across the country giving out free medicines, testing and treatment. Patients come from afar and are sometimes forced to turn back that day with no medicine or treatment as doctors are not available at all times and there is no privacy for PLHA.Given these challenges, the transition to a public distribution system should have been better thought out, feels Hafizuddin Munna, president of the PLHIV (persons living with HIV) network. The logic was that the public system is already equipped to handle hundreds of thousands of patients. Why shouldn't it be able to provide treatment to a few thousand?Hafizuddin worries that the government will not be able to provide comprehensive care in relation to the unique challenges PLHA face. “Service providers are generally not trained to be sensitive. And people in our country are already reluctant to access government healthcare,” he says. The service used to be available locally, with NGOs often paying home visits. Now, patients have to makes trips to the hospital. “The service needs to be incentivised,” says Hafizuddin.Dr Belal Hossain, deputy director and programme manager of the national AIDS/STS programme says however, “There has been no problem so far in service delivery. The system is very much the same as before, with PLHA being given two months' worth of medicine and confidentiality being maintained.” Dr Belal says that the shift from the NGOs to government had been anticipated earlier and the transition happened smoothly.But as Akib's case illustrates, just providing medicines is not enough. For Akib, who lost his mother, more care was needed than just telling him to come pick up his medicines. He needed care that went beyond. If he had had that, maybe he wouldn't have left this world at the tender age of 12.","['death', 'hivpositive', 'plha', 'hospital', 'patients', 'akib', 'hospitals', 'treatment', 'medicines', 'status', 'hiv', 'fight', 'living']","For those with HIV, the immune system is suppressed, making it harder to fight off other infections.

Why the HIV epidemic is not over,1 December 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day – a day created to raise awareness about HIV and the resulting AIDS epidemics.,,2018-12-02T00:00:00+06:00,"1 December 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day – a day created to raise awareness about HIV and the resulting AIDS epidemics. Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have acquired the infection, and about 35 million people have died. Today, around 37 million worldwide live with HIV, of whom 22 million are on treatment. This December is the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day, with the theme: “Know Your Status”.When World AIDS Day was first established in 1988, the world looked very different to how it is today. Now, we have easily accessible testing, treatment, a range of prevention options, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, and services that can reach vulnerable communities.The effort to develop effective treatment for HIV is remarkable in its speed and success. Clinical trials of antiretrovirals (ARVs) began in 1985 – the same year that the first HIV test was approved – and the first ARV was approved for use in 1987. However, a single drug was found to have only short-term benefits.  By 1995, ARVs were being prescribed in various combinations. A breakthrough in the HIV response was announced to the world at the 11th International AIDS Conference in Vancouver when the success of as “highly active antiretroviral treatment” (HAART) – a combination of three ARVs reported to reduce AIDS-related deaths by between 60% and 80%.Because of the high cost of ARVs, most low- and middle-income countries could not afford to provide treatment through their public programmes. World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the ‘3 by 5‘ initiative with the aim of providing HIV treatment to 3 million people in low- and middle-income countries by 2005. The '3 by 5' initiative was the most ambitious public health programme ever launched, which would increase 15-fold the number of people receiving life-saving treatment in some of the poorest countries of the world, in just three years. In 2015, WHO recommended the use of ARVs to prevent HIV acquisition – pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP – for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk.HIV is not an easy virus to defeat. Nearly a million people still die every year from the virus because they do not know they have HIV and are not on treatment, or they start treatment late. This is despite WHO guidelines in 2015 recommending that all people living with HIV should receive antiretroviral treatment, regardless of their immune status and stage of infection, and as soon as possible after their diagnosis.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  One of the biggest challenges in the HIV response has remained unchanged for 30 years: HIV disproportionally affects people in vulnerable populations that are often highly marginalised and stigmatised. Thus, most new HIV infections and deaths are seen in places where certain higher-risk groups remain unaware, underserved or neglected.The theme of this World AIDS Day – Know Your Status – is important. One in four people with HIV do not know that they have HIV. To bridge some critical gaps in the availability of HIV tests, WHO recommends the use of self-tests for HIV. WHO first recommended HIV self-testing in 2016, and now more than 50 countries have developed policies on self-testing.

"Stigma, discrimination and HIV/AIDS","I am HIV positive. Few of my close friends know about my HIV status. At first I told it to my wife. After knowing my HIV status, her behavior towards me was very discriminatory. My wife suspects me. The day my wife came to know about my HIV status, she poured patrol all over the house.",,2013-12-14T00:04:01+06:00,"I am HIV positive. Few of my close friends know about my HIV status. At first I told it to my wife. After knowing my HIV status, her behavior towards me was very discriminatory. My wife suspects me. The day my wife came to know about my HIV status, she poured patrol all over the house. She wanted to die with our two little children that day. However, my utmost efforts prevent my wife from setting fire. My wife began to use separate bedroom, bathroom, soap and almost everything of our house. If our two children wanted to come to me, my wife would forbid them. In this way I passed two and a half years. In this period, I was totally separated from my wife and children.” said Sonjib (a pseudonym HIV-positive). In family level, many people become stigmatised and discriminated for their HIV positive status. PLWHAs (People living with HIV/AIDS) face discrimination, stigmatized behavior, social criticism and social rejection after disclosing their HIV status. In 1987 Jonathan Mann, the Director of World Health Organizations Global Program on AIDS, forecast three components to the HIV epidemic: the first would be HIV, the second AIDS, and the third would be Stigma, Discrimination and Denial. He predicted that stigma and discrimination and denial would be as central as the illness itself. UN Secretary Ban Ki Moon says: “Stigma remains the single most important barrier to public action. It is the main reason why too many people are afraid to see a doctor to determine whether they have the disease, or to seek treatment if so. It helps make AIDS the silent killer: because people fear social disgrace of speaking about it, or akin gasify available precautions.”According to our societal view, people who are infected with HIV virus are considered to be caused by sexual intercourse which is not socially sanctioned in our conservative Bangladesh. It is also not approved by religious morality. This leads to one of the barriers to curb the disclosure of their HIV-positive status. As a collectivistic society like Bangladesh, HIV-positive individual may be seen as a reflection of not only oneself but also one's family or community. Therefore, PLWHAs want to keep the information secret to avoid social criticism. AIDS is a dangerous and shameful disease to them. If it is disclosed, it will be difficult for them to sustain the family and conjugal life.Many people in our country are fearful that HIV is contagious and can be transmitted through casual link contact like holding hands and hugging. In our country, the information of HIV and AIDS sometimes misguides people. The silent surrounding of the disease and various myths, taboos and misconceptions about the disease also increase stigma among the PLWHAs. When family knows HIV status, this becomes a tale and that is why his or her respect decreases. Besides, many people hide their HIV status from their family members due to the fear of the decrease of respect. PLWHAs in our country do not disclose their status to their friends, neighbours or others, because they fear if all know their status, they will be more stigmatized and discriminated than the present. Most of the educational institutions do not allow HIV students to study at their institutions. PLWHAs suffered economically due to discrimination of losing their jobs. Stigma and discriminations are daily realities for people living with HIV. Many PLWHAs have even become the victim of the worst discrimination due to positive status.Women tend to experience greater stigma and discrimination than men in our society. They have also fewer resources for acclimatizing with this situation. In our society, women are only eyed for their household activities and reproductive activity. Adolescent girls are forced into early marriage because of unequal access to education, empowerment and decision making rights. Women are forced to engage in unprotected sex due to their powerlessness in decision-making. In most of the cases, married women are infected with the virus by their husbands.Self or internal stigma is another important fact that forces many of the PLWHAs to feel guilty and shame for their status. Self or internal stigma is an ongoing phenomenon that places a social burden and barrier on PLWHAs. PLWHAs feel isolated, guilty, dirty and full of shame. Many PLWHAs perceive AIDS as a moral punishment for them. They often believe to deserve their illness because they have done something “wrong”.We are now frequently having meetings, round tables, debates that might teach us some lessons but we do not discuss about HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination. It is one of the major hidden reasons for why people are not interested to test HIV.  In addition, this is why most possibly in near future HIV/AIDS will be the silent killer to aggravate the situation of Bangladesh. People of our country look this disease as a “curse of God” or as a “punishment for bad behavior”. People are afraid to come forward to be tested for HIV. The fear of stigma and discrimination makes them hide that they are HIV positive. HIV positive individuals, their relatives, friends, their most close ones and even the doctors are reluctant to give them proper care and support when they need the support most. They may be forced out from their homes, jobs, educational institutions and even from society. In the United States, HIV confidentiality guidelines recommend that health professionals should not divulge personal information to others in ways inconsistent with the client's original consent (United States Centers for Disease Control, 1999). But in our country we have no effective rules regarding this issue.The risk behavior of HIV/AIDS is deteriorating in our neighboring countries like Myanmar, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Bangladesh is in a better position, but not out of danger.  According to National AIDS Committee (2006) 7500 person are living with HIV nationwide. Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition estimates that HIV/AIDS remains at less than 1% amongst most at risk populations. The number of current positive population in Bangladesh is not significant at this moment but the important issue is that the numbers are steadily increasing. Female and male sex workers, IDUs (Injecting Drug Users), migrated workers, transgender persons are very risky population for the transmission of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is in a vulnerable zone due to high transmission rate of HIV in our neighbouring country India. Indian efforts have failed to address the issue of stigma and discrimination and negative attitudes towards the PLWHAs in their policy. As a result, PLWHAs try to hide their status to everyone, even to their life partners due to social ostracisms.Various measures, plans, programs and policies have been taken by both government and non-government organizations to reduce the outbreak of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. Various policies have been successfully implemented but the matters of stigma and discrimination of HIV/AIDS patients have not come on focus or upwards with the importance in the discussion or have not yet been included in the policy. So it is high time to rectify our behavior towards the PLWHAs. If we will be able to reduce the fear of stigma and discrimination of HIV/AIDS patients, patients will come to test for HIV and it will be possible for us to resist the outbreak of this fatal disease. We should increase the religious morality and teachings which will be a safeguard for the involvement of highly risky behavior. We should not maltreat the PLWHAs. They have the right to get good behavior from the mass people. They have the right to get medical treatment and the right to get personal support and care from their family and friends. State should not violate their human rights. We should not maltreat them in a way that they are forced to accept death before their inevitable death. We should increase positive attitudes among the people towards HIV/AIDS patients and reduce the prejudices against this disease.The writer is Lecturer, Department of Social Relations, East West University .Email: sifat_tu@yahoo.com)    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'disease', 'wife', 'stigma', 'status', 'discrimination', 'positive', 'social', 'plwhas', 'hiv']","PLWHAs (People living with HIV/AIDS) face discrimination, stigmatized behavior, social criticism and social rejection after disclosing their HIV status.

HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh,,,2010-11-27T00:00:00+06:00,"Target of universal access to treatment Is yet to achieveDr Md Rajib HossainAlthough the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh is not high, the country has failed to ensure antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of this small figure. According to a recent progress report by World Health Organisation (WHO), Bangladesh has not moved even closer to achieve the universal access target of ART. Experts identified limited services given only by NGOs, social marginalisation, lack of human resources, diagnostics and other health systems bottlenecks as the key factors behind this.In order to lessen the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, United Nations member states in 2006 committed to the goal of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. Although there is a 13-fold increase in ART coverage worldwide over six years, only one third of people in need have access to treatment. The coverage of prevention interventions is still insufficient and most people living with HIV remain unaware of their HIV status. Population surveys in ten countries showed more than 60 percent of HIV-positive people did not know their HIV status. As a result, many patients start treatment too late. Around 18 percent of patients initiating treatment were lost to follow-up during the first year, a large proportion of them dying due to late initiation of treatment.According to the progress report, only eight low- and middle-income countries have achieved universal access target or coverage of 80 percent or higher for ART based on data from end of 2009. Also, there are 21 countries that are moving closer to achieve the universal access target, with coverage rates between 50-80 percent for ART.In Bangladesh, Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash Bangladesh and Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAP) are the three NGOs working to provide coverage of ART to all people living with HIV/AIDS. Experts opined that along with NGOs, the government should establish more centres and monitor the programme strictly in order to ensure universal coverage. There is urgent need to provide coverage of ART for people who are the most affected by HIV, especially injecting drug users (IDUs) where HIV/AIDS is a concentrated epidemic (more than 5%).Many high risk low- and middle-income countries have been shown promising ART coverage for most of its affected people. We need to work together to expand the services to make sure that not a single affected individual are left out of treatment services.E-mail: rajib.hossain@thedailystar.netIncorporating reproductive health services for young people through the national HIV/AIDS responsesDr Nizam Uddin AhmedOne of the characteristics of HIV/AIDS pandemic globally is — it affects young people the most and turns into a generalised epidemic through this segment. As such most of the prevention related regimen are concerned with reducing the vulnerabilities of youth to HIV/AIDS exposure by creating enabling environment for them through availability and accessibility of appropriate services and related information.There is common assumption that young people do not need reproductive and sexual health related information and service prior to marriage. This exacerbates their susceptibility in fact. Hence at the inception stage of the national programme under the GFATM grants, the human rights perspective for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support regimen for addressing the neglected areas of reproductive health information and services for youth was established.Essentially this translated into generating simultaneous thrusts towards diminishing the primary barriers of beliefs, norms, stigma and discrimination. At the initial phase the intervention components focused on mass media campaign, youth friendly health services, life skills education, access to condoms, institutionalising HIV/AIDS information in mainstream education curriculum, advocacy with societal decision makers and religious leaders and developing evidence base for policy and programmeThe incorporation between HIV/AIDS and reproductive health has paved the path for establishing youth friendly health services and life skills education that prepares young people to adjust with the emotional and physical changes they experience, analyse critical situation to avoid exposure and the ability eschew peer pressure on premarital sex, substance abuse and early marriage.So, integration of HIV/AIDS within the existing paradigm of reproductive health and education services is need of the time.The writer is the Director, HIV/AIDS Sector and South Asia Programme Advisor, Save the Children USA.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'access', 'reproductive', 'universal', 'health', 'treatment', 'services', 'coverage', 'art']","According to a recent progress report by World Health Organisation (WHO), Bangladesh has not moved even closer to achieve the universal access target of ART.

Time to look back at the bridges we've crossed,"Every year World AIDS Day is observed on December 1, established by the World Health Organization in 1988 to bring people together in the fight against HIV and raise awareness of the epidemic that shook the world.",Anindita Roy,2018-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Every year World AIDS Day is observed on December 1, established by the World Health Organization in 1988 to bring people together in the fight against HIV and raise awareness of the epidemic that shook the world. This year, World AIDS Day will be marking its 30th anniversary and the theme is “Know Your Status”. This campaign aims to intensify HIV testing, which will enable people to make right and informed choices of treatment and prevention. World AIDS Day is an occasion to come together and renew our commitment to fight the disease, to analyse our success and what more needs to be done to achieve the goal to end the epidemic by 2030. On this day we wear red ribbons and revisit strategies in our fight against HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).Undoubtedly massive achievement has been made in HIV and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) response since we first heard about the “mysterious virus” in the 1980s. According to the UNAIDS report (2018) “the number of AIDS-related deaths is the lowest this century, with fewer than 1 million people dying each year from AIDS-related illnesses”. The access to affordable antiretroviral treatment has contributed to this success. “Now a record 21.7 million people are on treatment—a net increase of 2.3 million people since the end of 2016” (UNAIDS data 2018).But the history of HIV and AIDS epidemic is one of fear, deaths, personal trauma and a long fight for affordable medicines. It required a handsome quintessential Hollywood actor Rock Hudson to die (1985) for the whole world to take notice of this epidemic. How can we forget that we lost flamboyant rockstar Freddie Mercury to this “mysterious virus”? The tragic death of high-profile personalities in rich countries brought attention to the epidemic that was killing millions of men, women and children from all walks of life around the world. Some of my colleagues were attending funerals of their friends almost every week in the 80s. They said that their friends were “dropping like flies”.Like many people of my generation born in Bangladesh, I was not aware of the growing grassroots movement in the 1980s and 1990s that was seeking to deal with an epidemic that appeared unmanageable and untreatable. It was much later, when I was studying public health that I became aware of the broader engagement of stakeholders in the HIV movement, and heard about some more great examples of HIV response, such as the global shaming effort that brought about the reduction in the cost of anti-retroviral drugs—an intervention that saved millions of lives.Current treatment costs for HIV can be as low as around USD 100 for a patient per year. This was not the case 25 years ago. The cost of treatment for HIV in 1994-95 was around USD 8,000-10,000 the (only available drug was azidothymidine AZT). The high cost of AZT was one of the major obstacles preventing access to treatment. It is said that AZT was the most expensive prescription drug up to that time. The unprecedented drop in price of medicines emerged from a confluence of grassroots movement, broader political engagement and, eventually, damage control by large pharmaceutical companies whose reputation was on the line—five pharmaceutical companies negotiating with UNAIDS for an unprecedented reduction in the price of anti-retroviral drugs in developing countries. Soon after, generic manufacturer such as Cipla in India began producing generic HIV medicines for developing countries that further brought down the drug price. The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Doha Declaration allowed developing countries to manufacture generic drugs, making treatment more affordable and accessible. In 2001 the United Nations General Assembly called for the creation of a “global fund” to intensify efforts by countries and organisations to fight the spread of HIV through prevention, treatment and care though affordable medication.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Why am I telling this story today? On the occasion of World AIDS Day, I want to cherish the success of a movement that led pharmaceutical companies to allow production of generic drugs. We always hear that the pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to give up the rights of the patent. It was a long struggle to make drugs affordable since US Food and Drug Administration approved AZT as treatment for HIV in 1987, but it showed that voices raised strongly enough can change history. Now the HIV diagnosed patients do not look like Tom Hanks in the film Philadelphia (1993), the first major Hollywood movie to focus on AIDS. Being HIV positive is not a death sentence anymore. Available and affordable treatment has allowed people to live a normal, healthy life.I am very much aware that the success in combating HIV and AIDS has not reached every part of the world. Many countries still face challenges around access, resources, shortage of healthcare professionals, stigma and discrimination. But today I want to be with my colleagues who were part of the HIV movement. Sometimes we need to look back and see the bridges we crossed, the past that shaped the history of HIV movement, needs to be recognised. On the occasion of World AIDS Day, let's remember the success, let us not allow complacency to set in and take vows to eradicate the disease by 2030.

Moreover, the vaccine candidate protected against infection with an HIV-like virus in monkeys.Based on the results from this phase 1/2a clinical trial that involved nearly 400 healthy adults, a phase 2b trial has been initiated in southern Africa to determine the safety and efficacy of the HIV-1 vaccine candidate in 2,600 women at risk for acquiring HIV. This is one of only five experimental HIV-1 vaccine concepts that have progressed to efficacy trials in humans in the 35 years of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.Previous HIV-1 vaccine candidates have typically been limited to specific regions of the world. The experimental regimens tested in this study are based on ‘mosaic’ vaccines that take pieces of different HIV viruses and combine them to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of HIV strains.“These results represent an important milestone. This study demonstrates that the mosaic Ad26 prime, Ad26 plus gp140 boost HIV vaccine candidate induced robust immune responses in humans and monkeys with comparable magnitude, kinetics, phenotype, and durability and also provided 67% protection against viral challenge in monkeys”, says Professor Dan Barouch, Director of the Centre for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA who led the study.Almost 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. A safe and effective preventative vaccine is urgently needed to curb the HIV pandemic.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  A key hurdle to HIV vaccine development has been the lack of direct comparability between clinical trials and preclinical studies. To address these methodological issues, Barouch and colleagues evaluated the leading mosaic adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates in parallel clinical and pre-clinical studies to identify the optimal HIV vaccine regimen to advance into clinical efficacy trials.The APPROACH trial recruited 393 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults (aged 18-50 years) from 12 clinics in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the USA between February 2015 and October 2015. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either one of seven vaccine combinations or a placebo, and were given four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks.Results showed that all vaccine regimens tested were capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in healthy individuals and were well tolerated, with similar numbers of local and systemic reactions reported in all groups, most of which were mild-to-moderate in severity. Five participants reported at least one vaccine-related grade 3 adverse event such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea, postural dizziness, and back pain. No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were reported.In a parallel study, the researchers assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the same Ad26-based mosaic vaccine regimens in 72 rhesus monkeys using a series repeated challenges with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) — a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys.The Ad26/Ad26 plus gp140 vaccine candidate induced the greatest immune responses in humans and also provided the best protection in monkeys — resulting in complete protection against SHIV infection in two-thirds of the vaccinated animals after six challenges.The authors note several limitations, including the fact that the relevance of vaccine protection in rhesus monkeys to clinical efficacy in humans remains unclear. They also note that there is no definitive immunological measurement that is known to predict protection against HIV-1 in humans.","['immune', 'protection', 'humans', 'monkeys', 'hiv1', 'novel', 'efficacy', 'candidate', 'responses', 'clinical', 'vaccine', 'hiv', 'responsive', 'safe']","New research published in The Lancet shows that an experimental HIV-1 vaccine regimen is well-tolerated and generated comparable and robust immune responses against HIV in healthy adults and rhesus monkeys.

Responsible behavior and HIV/AIDS,,,2013-12-14T00:00:00+06:00,"HIV/AIDS was first detected among a few homosexual men. Gradually the proportion of women infected by HIV has risen. Of the total infected persons globally, 48% are women. Among them majority are young and adolescent, many are married and have had one partner i.e. their legal husband. Married women who are faithful to their husbands and had no history of pre-marital or extra-marital relationship are not less vulnerable to HIV infection. In the recent report published by UNFPA (State of world population 2005) it was stated that sex within the bondage of marriage is not always safe and cannot give protection against HIV infection. The percentage of women becoming infected by their legal partner is increasing alarmingly. In India 90% of HIV infected women were virgin when they were married, had no history of pre-marital sex and remained faithful to their husbands (State of world population 2005). The scenario in Bangladesh is almost the same as that of India. Unfortunately there is no authentic data on how many married women got HIV infection from their husband. In the voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) center of CAAP, 6702 samples of blood had been tested for HIV since 1996 to date and 451 persons were found HIV positive. Out of them 159 were women. Except a few of these unfortunate women all of them got the infection from the legal bondage of marriage, i.e. from their husband. It has been observed that community leaders, religious leaders, even civil society and elites have believe that one cannot get HIV infection within the legal relationship of marriage. This strong belief/misconception is dangerous. HIV has no respect for legal relationship within the bondage of marriage or illegal relation without marriage. HIV can infect anyone, married or unmarried, if someone has sexual contact (irresponsible behavior) with any HIV infected person without the protection of condom. Use of condom, or protected sex, is the responsibility of men. Married women all over the world cannot negotiate safe sex with their husband even though they are aware of their husband’s extra marital relations. Because of their subordinated status, women cannot even challenge the fidelity of their husband. Yet they are the victims. Men’s responsible behavior can save the situation.The writer is Executive Director Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP).    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'behavior', 'sex', 'infected', 'world', 'women', 'married', 'legal', 'marriage', 'husband', 'hiv', 'infection', 'responsible']","Gradually the proportion of women infected by HIV has risen.

HIV/AIDS: Bangladesh at high risk?,"Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country with several well-documented at-risk groups, the most prominent of which is brothel-based sex workers and injecting drug users. Although prevalence rate is remaining low in the country, it is surrounded by nations with much higher prevalence rates and with its own at-risk population. Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/Aids infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in Colombo, on August 19-23, 2007.",,2007-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country with several well-documented at-risk groups, the most prominent of which is brothel-based sex workers and injecting drug users.

Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/Aids infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in Colombo, on August 19-23, 2007. The outbreak of HIV in neighbouring countries, cross borders and steady rise of STIs make Bangladesh a high-risk zone for HIV/AIDS prevalence.Today's low level of HIV infection in our country does not guarantee low prevalence tomorrow. Experience teaches us that early epidemics do not show their magnitude at the beginning. This is good news that our government, donors, and large numbers of NGOs have begun serious investment in both research and prevention interventions. But it also requires efforts of care and support for the people living with HIV/AIDS. It is difficult to capture such a large range of activities with one or just a few indicators. However, a set of well-established health care indicators may help to identify general strengths and weaknesses of health systems. The scale of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has exceeded all expectations since its identification in 1981. As the spread of HIV has been greater than predicted, its severe impact on social, capital, population structure and economic growth has been apprehended.High risk factorsBehavioral risk factors for HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh are in a danger situation. Besides that there are potential bio-medical risk factors including: (i) an unregulated blood supply system in which blood used in transfusions is not screened for HIV and is donated primarily by professional donors; (ii) unsterile injections in non-formal and formal health-care settings; and (iii) a high prevalence in high-risk groups of other sexually transmitted diseases, which may function as co-factors for HIV transmission, particularly if chronically untreated.  Bangladesh behavioral surveillance survey (BSS) reports on several high-risk factors: (a) large number of men buying sex than in other countries in Asia, (b) low levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, (c) low perception of personal risk among vulnerable populations, and (d) low condom use rates among sex workers.Knowledge and behaviourInformation on knowledge and on the level and intensity of risk behaviours related to HIV/AIDS is essential in identifying populations at most risk for HIV infection and in better understanding the dynamics of the epidemic.The indicators on knowledge and misconceptions are an important prerequisite for prevention programmes to focus on increasing people's knowledge about sexual transmission, and, to overcome the misconceptions that act as a disincentive to behaviour change. Indicators on sexual behaviour and the promotion of safer sexual behavior are at the core of HIV/AIDS programmes, particularly with young people who are embarking on their sexual lives, and who are more amenable to behavioral change than adults. Overall denial and apparent confusion about their own risk of acquiring an HIV infection increased among brothel sex workers, with a rise in the “don't know” response from about 25% to 40%. It is not likely that knowledge percentage was scant, it is far more likely that increased insecurity regarding the future maintenance of their residences and livelihoods diminished their capacity to insist on condom use.STD/STI  situation  The predominant mode of transmission of both HIV and other STD/STIs is sexual intercourse. Measures for preventing sexual transmission of HIV and STIs are the same, as are the target audiences for interventions. In addition, strong evidence supports several biological mechanisms through which STIs facilitate HIV transmission by increasing both HIV infectiousness and HIV susceptibility in Bangladesh. In the 2004-05, the Sentinel Surveillance mentioned that syphilis rates were high among hijras (20%) and varied from 6 percent to 16 percent among brothel based female sex workers. A declining trend of syphilis was however observed at many of the city brothels.Epidemiological situationThe first case of HIV infection was detected in Bangladesh in 1989; by the end of December 2006 the official number of reported cases of HIV was 874 with 240 cases of AIDS of which 109 had died. Bangladesh as a nation has a low prevalence of HIV but risk behaviours are sufficient enough for continued HIV transmission among groups at higher risk and to its general population. Bangladesh has an established second generation HIV surveillance system. This system consists of a sero-surveillance component (implemented by ICDDR,B for the Government of Bangladesh, using World Bank/DFID funding) and a behavioral surveillance component (executed by Family Health International, funded by USAID). The data indicate that HIV prevalence rates among the most vulnerable population groups and some bridging population groups (mainly male clients of sex workers) have remained at Criminalisation of HIV transmissionSeveral countries have recently introduced laws to criminalise HIV transmission, or exposing another person to the virus. A number of jurisdictions have used general laws against serious bodily harm in cases where someone is accused of knowingly transmitting HIV or willingly exposing others to HIV transmission. Subject of controversy, these measures are sparking debate and concern among policymakers, legal and public health professionals, international organisations and civil society, on whether criminal law is applicable in such cases and if such application is accomplishing or damaging public health goals such as universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. Addressing these issues, UNAIDS brought together a range of stakeholders in Geneva for a three-day international consultation (31 Oct - 2 Nov 2007) to discuss the apparent trend of criminalisation of HIV transmission in the context of national responses.ConclusionResponding to HIV/AIDS on a scale commensurate with the epidemic is a global imperative, and the tools for an effective response are inevitable. Detection and treatment of individuals with STIs is an important part of an HIV control strategy. Clinical services offering STI care are an important access point for people at high risk for both STIs and HIV. Identifying people with STIs allows for not only the benefit of treating the STI, but for prevention education, HIV testing, identifying HIV-infected persons in need of care, and partner notification for STIs or HIV infection. Nothing less than a sustained social mobilisation is necessary to combat one of the most serious crises facing the world community today. As the chair of the Technical Committee of the National AIDS Committee said, a poor country Bangladesh has to opt for preventive measures rather than depend on costly drugs or future vaccines.Nicholas Biswas is a Researcher and NGO Activist.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'stis', 'sex', 'prevalence', 'transmission', 'sexual', 'low', 'hiv', 'high', 'risk']","Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country with several well-documented at-risk groups, the most prominent of which is brothel-based sex workers and injecting drug users.

Understanding HIV and AIDS,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a form of virus that may cause an infection, but AIDS is a condition or a syndrome.",,2016-11-29T00:00:00+06:00,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a form of virus that may cause an infection, but AIDS is a condition or a syndrome. Being infected with HIV can lead to the development of AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. AIDS develops when HIV has caused serious damage to the immune system.AIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections like pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis.HOW IS HIV TRANSMITTED?HIV is most commonly found in two bodily fluids - blood and genital fluids like semen. It is transmitted through sexual contact (e.g. intercourse via any route), parenteral exposure to contaminated blood, transfusion of infected blood, pricks or cuts by needles/blades that are contaminated by infected blood, sharing of needles/syringes (mainly by substance abusers) and from mother to child (while the child is in the womb, during labour and through breastfeeding).HOW IS HIV NOT TRANSMITTED?There is no risk of transmitting HIV through kissing, spitting, being bitten, being sneezed on or through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. There is also no risk in sharing baths, towels, cutlery, or in using the same toilets or swimming pools. Contact with unbroken healthy skin and with animals/insects, too, does not result in the transmission of HIV. SYMPTOMS TO LOOK OUT FOR    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Symptoms can include fever, sore throat, body rash, tiredness, joint pain, muscle pain and swollen glands (lymph nodes). Once the immune system becomes severely damaged, symptoms can comprise weight loss, chronic diarrhoea, night sweats, skin problems, recurrent infections and serious life-threatening illnesses.DIAGNOSING HIVHIV can only be diagnosed through medical tests. If you think you might be at risk, you should immediately seek medical advice. The earlier HIV is diagnosed, the earlier you can start treatment, delay the severity of the illness and prevent the disease spreading to your near ones.The most common form of HIV test is a blood examination, in which a small amount of bloodis takenand tested for HIV. This can provide a reliable result within four weeks of exposure to HIV.TREATING HIVUnfortunately, there are still no cures for AIDS. However, there are treatments that can prolong life of people tested HIV positive and can help them lead a productive life.PREVENTION OF HIVHIV is widely spread through unscreened blood transfusion so it is essential that all blood is meticulously checked before transfusion.A condom is the most effective form of protection against HIV and other STIs. It can be used for vaginal and anal sex, and for oral sex performed on men. HIV can be passed on before ejaculation, through pre-ejaculatory fluid and vaginal secretions, and from the anus. Safe sex should be practiced by people having risky sexual behaviours.Needles/syringes should not be shared among substance abusers. Other injecting equipments such as spoons and swabs should not be shared either as this exposes one to HIV and other viruses found in the blood, such as hepatitis C.Clean and sterile needles should be used while making tattoos.HIV AND PREGNANCYTreatment is available to prevent a pregnant woman from passing HIV to her unborn child. If left untreated, there is a one in four chance that the child will be infected with HIV. However, through proper medical care the risk can lowered to one in hundred.Due to advances in medicine, there is no increased risk of passing the virus to your baby with a normal delivery. However, for some women, a caesarean section may still be recommended. If you have HIV, do not breastfeed your baby because the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. If you or your partner have HIV, speak to a doctor as there are options for safely conceiving a child without putting either of you at risk of infection.World AIDS Day is observed on 1st December each year and is dedicated to raise worldwide awareness of the Acquired Immuno deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic caused by the spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.

Still we have been continuing IDU intervention since 1998.  The first HIV-positive case diagnosed in Bangladesh, in 1989, was a returnee migrant. National surveillance data of 2011 revealed that HIV prevalence among sex workers in land port areas (Hili) is higher than average prevalence rate among sex workers in general. According to IOM data of 2012, 60% of the reported HIV-positives are migrants. We have to take this issue seriously because there are case studies in our neighbouring countries for example in Ganjam district in India where HIV-positive cases was in single digit in 1999-2000 but within ten years the number increased in thousands.According to 2001 India census, there were approximately 3 million Bangladeshi migrants  working in India. Reasons of this huge number of cross border migration are lack of employment at source (Bangladesh), comparatively high wages at destination (India), low migration cost, porous border and geographic proximity.These migrant workers remain in isolation and poor working condition that led to engage in risky sexual behaviour. They lack spousal communication and consistent condom use. They often pursue sexual relationships with commercial sex workers without condom. There are also incidents of women and girls trafficking across border who are also vulnerable to HIV and AIDS.The EMPHASIS project has been started in 2009. Our goal was to reduce the vulnerability to HIV and AIDS of population mobile between Bangladesh and Nepal to India. And our objective was to demonstrate effective good practice models and for HIV prevention care and support; to enhance capacity of government other service providers; to develop evidence based advocacy.Our project implementation area covers source, transit and destination areas. At the source area we work in Jessore and Satkhira in Bangladesh and Achham and Kanchanpur in Nepal. Transit areas include Jessore/ Satkhira border and West Bengal in case of Bangladeshi migrants. And the destination areas where we work under this project are Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata.In Bangladesh, 82,008 target populations has been reached with health education as of January 2014. We have established two Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) centres in Jessore and Satkhira government hospitals. As of April, 2014, 2184 individuals were diagnosed in these two centres. We got 38 HIV-positive and that is more than 1.5% of total number of tested clients.We have to continue awareness, BCC and counselling activities targeting migrants and their family members using existing GoB health infrastructure as well as to establish and continue HIV testing and counselling services at GoB health facilities in the district with high concentration of migrant populations.  Another immediate action would be integration of prevention and referral services including adequate supplies of STI drugs and condoms to all.In the long term we need to ensure migrant rights and entitlements at all levels and universal access to health services. Bilateral dialogues should be held to address the cross border mobility issue. Leo KennyLeo Kenny, Country Representative, UNAIDSIt is really critical in Bangladesh that we do not silo the issue of HIV and migration. It needs to be looked at globally, regionally and locally. Recently, 52 countries have met in Bangladesh to discuss on migration in post 2015. This is a long term issue and it is a global issue. It is about equity, human rights and equality.The work EMPHASIS is doing is not sustainable and it should not be so. This is the job of state to be providing care, support, and treatment to migrants. There are a lot of Bangladeshis in India and they are called Bangle Speaking Population (BSP). It is so stigmatized that they even do not call them Bangladeshis. It is the role of UN to help countries in the region to have inter-country dialogue to ensure safe migration because it is very good for everybody as a choice. Shakirul IslamShakirul Islam, Chairman, Ovibashi Kormi Unnayan Program ( OKUP)Every year officially 4 lakh people migrate from Bangladesh to overseas. Various research show that migrants are vulnerable to HIV. Migrant workers are cross sectional populations. Many of them are practising MSM behaviour and many women workers are forced into sex work in the overseas. Most of the migrants do not have knowledge about AIDS.  We should have very intensive and effective education for potential migrants. There is no referral system for migrants who are often deported for being HIV-positive when they go to renew their visas. These deported migrants often hide their status. So there should be referral system for these HIV-positive migrants.  Binoy Krishna MallickMs. Mukti, Executive Director, Mukto Akash BangladeshWe are working with PLHIV. We are providing supports to 500 PLHIV. When we refer a patient to clinics for surgery, doctors deny providing health service to a HIV-positive. So PLHIV needs special care and under this project we are trying to fill this gap.     googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });        Binoy Krishna MallickBinoy Krishna Mallick, Executive Director, Rights JessoreIn the project areas of EMPHASIS there has been significant improvement of people's consciousness about HIV. So we have to continue this type of initiative in the border areas.Migration is a continuous process and a large share of migration happens through land boundary. Both India and Bangladesh should recognize this reality and come to an agreement to issue work permit to migrant workers.   Dr. Tariqul IslamDr. Tariqul Islam, Deputy Director, Ad-din Welfare CentreWe have been working with undocumented migrants. There is a serious gap in awareness about HIV among migrants. Only projects are not adequate .We need strong government intervention to continue mass campaign and awareness building activities among migrants.    Dr. SZ AtiqDr. SZ Atiq, Principal, Satkhira Medical CollegeThe establishment of VCT centres in Satkhira and Jessore, initiated by Care Bangladesh and Rights Jessore, is a matter of pride for our health ministry. Since April 2012, 895 patients have come to the VCT centre for voluntary testing in Satkhira. Among them, 16 were HIV-positive. In order to sustain this project, I would urge the government and other stakeholders to continue with this programme.    Mahtabul HakimMahtabul Hakim, Programme Coordinator, UN WomenThe issue of cross border migration is of particular importance because earlier on we would hear of migration cases from India but recently more and more cases of emigration to Nepal have emerged. As a result, cross-border migration should be a crucial issue which needs our special attention.I congratulate CARE on the work they've done so far but I think that if work in this area gets over with the completion of this project then we have cause to worry. The government needs to concentrate on how these works can be brought under its health system.  Tarik Hassan ShahriarTarik Hassan Shahriar, The Daily SunIn the case of cross border migration, both formal and informal migration is part of it. Health is a very significant issue for migrant workers. We have a database for our local workers who travel abroad for work but we don't have any database for returning migrant workers. If we could create a database for returning migrant workers, it would be easy for those working in this area to screen the workers for providing them HIV testing and counselling services. Secondly, stigma discrimination is prevalent in our society and it is a significant barrier in rendering proper medical services to HIV-positive patients. If we could reduce this stigma and gradually eliminate it, we will find out that the number of HIV-positive patients will be much higher.  Dr. Tajudeen OyewaleDr Tajudeen Oyewale, Head of HIV, UNICEFFirstly we need to have a cross border partnership that looks into the health of migrants from source country and also in the destination country. We need cross ministerial walk on that and also the involvement of the foreign affairs ministry.We really need the leadership of the honourable secretary to consider having an integrated centre for HIV and AIDS management in Bangladesh. We don't need many; probably just three to four will be fine. For example, we can have a centre in Dhaka at the BSMMU; they can offer every kind of service related to HIV, irrespective of type, treatment, testing and care. Same thing could be replicated in Khulna and probably in Sylhet and Chittagong as wellI will want to use a community based approach because all of us are migrants. We all move from one place to another so you cannot really say that this is one place where you will find migrants but you can say that this is the source community where most migrants that do cross border migration really emerge from, like the work that the EMPHASIS project has done in Satkhira  and Jessore.In the context of HIV, we really need to bring a lot of family planning into the work that we do because if you think about a male migrant who has gone out, when he comes back the risk lies with his spouse and with other female partners in the community.Lastly, in migrant communities, we need to think about the children of migrants, their partners and their spouses. That's where my earlier proposal of integrated centres comes into place. When you have a centre that can do VCT, Prevention of Mother -to -Child Transmission (PMTCT) and monitoring all year around and offer treatments Theresa BlanchetTheresa Blanchet, Director, Drishti Research CentreEvery time I hear the numbers of people living with HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh, I think that we are catching only the tip of the iceberg. In our studies, we found that women in Mumbai who found that they were HIV-positive did not return. We heard of cases of women who were staying illegally in Dubai and caught HIV and AIDS committing suicides instead of returning. I don't know where the statistics are for these people. That points out to the huge stigma that this illness bears.The issue of migrant workers and especially female workers, they have really been ignored by everybody except to be beaten up and victimised. Back in 2003-2004, we were in Mumbai when Arab men from Dubai came to recruit bar dancers and it became known that the rate of HIV was very high. Suddenly there was great interest in recruiting girls from Bangladesh as the low prevalence in Bangladesh made it very attractive for them to be hired by those men.We also need to continue with research. Lot of good ideas and intentions were voiced around in this discussion but unless it's really grounded in the reality of these migrant workers, you won't go very far.    Syed Saiful HaqueSyed Saiful Haque, Chairman, WARBE Dev Foundation   As cross border migration and HIV vulnerability is an international issue, we need support from our own government as well as international governments.We know that there is a parliamentary caucus on HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh. We now need a grassroots based social structure where all stakeholders can talk and exchange ideas. If we need the focus on this issue to sustain, we can't just depend on a project. Thus, if all those organisations who work on migration can work in a coordinated manner, there would be a real difference.Bangladesh's policy is to export manpower and collect remittance from there but their health issues are ignored. CARE is taking a great initiative but we need to address how we can integrate migrants and health in Sustainable and Development Goal (SDG) or post-MDG, and health and migration policies as well. Hassan ImamHassan Imam, Programme Coordinator, Migration Programme, BRACThe presentation emphasised on the need for counselling and coordination between the two sectors of migration and health. If we come to the issue of counselling, the recommendations here clearly suggest that both documented and undocumented migrant workers need counselling.There is a gap in coordination between the migration sector and the health sector. We need to do much more work to establish this coordination between the two sectors for the welfare of migrant workers.   Dr. Samir Kumar HowladerDr. Samir Kumar Howlader, National Programme Officer, IOMMigration and cross-border mobility have always remained aside and still there is a gap in policies, collaboration and coordination between the ministry that deals with migration and the ministry of health. There is a health policy but migration is not integrated there or the policy and strategies related to migration does not account for the health issues of migration.Mainstreaming of HIV is very important, and the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment should consider this health issue as a mainstream agenda in migration management. Dr. Jahangir HossainDr. Jahangir Hossain, Programme Director-Health, Care BangladeshEMPHASIS is a learning platform to understand the vulnerability of migrant workers and test appropriate approaches, interventions and solutions. This is one of the important events with the participation of important policy makers and practitioners where we are sharing our experiences that we have learned through implementing EMPHASIS regional project of CARE International. The EMPHASIS project was primarily targeting undocumented migrant populations. One project or organisation can't deal with an issue of such magnitude. We need to develop a government response to address this issue.Through EMPHASIS we tried to reach the Cross Border Mobile Population at source using existing health infrastructure structure & system like the community clinics, Community Support Groups, FWC, health complexes and district hospitals. We found out that this approach yielded good results and the HIV prevention knowledge and service uptake level have been increased. This is a tested approach and this can be integrated into existing health systems in the other part of the country.There is a treaty between India and Nepal that if anyone from India is working in Nepal, they have access to services. If someone from Bangladesh works in non-Bengali speaking cities in India, they are always vulnerable often hide their identity as Bangladeshi. Civil Society Organisations working on HIV in India and Bangladesh share information but at the government level it almost absent. The governments need to patronise these civil society organisations for further collaborations.I hope in the future Government and Development Partners will allocate more resources for addressing the vulnerability of migrant workers and their family members at sources, transit and destinations.  We are happy that NASP has already allocated some resources on this issue through the World Bank, however, which is too small than the requirement. Hope, MOHFW will allocate more resources in the next operation plan and take leadership to coordinate with other ministries and stakeholders for effective implementation of migration program. M G Mustafa KhanM G Mustafa Khan, Director, BMET, Ministry of Overseas Employment & Expatriates' WelfareWe need a strong coordination among the ministry of health, the ministry of home affairs and ministry of foreign affairs on cross border migration and HIV issue. I also agree that awareness programmes should be organised in local health centres every month if not every week. I also believe that media has an important role to play in creating awareness.   A.K.M Nurun NabiProfessor A.K.M Nurun Nabi, Vice Chancellor, Begum Rokeya UniversityMigration is a social and economic indicator of change. It is inevitable and universal. It is a new phenomenon to look at migration from health perspective. So we have to discuss over it in great length to understand the full gamut of this linkage.I think, the initiation of our HIV programme was on a wrong footing. HIV has become a matter of stigma and fear to general people. Our approach to HIV is guilty of this misrepresentation. HIV should be treated like any other diseases.HIV issue should be assumed in our development paradigm; as such HIV is seriously hindering development efforts of several African countries. I would urge you all to join hand in upcoming ICAAP 12 to make the issue of migration and HIV as an international develop agenda.  Dr. Hussain Sarwar KhanDr. Hussain Sarwar Khan, Line Director, National AIDS/ STD Programme- NASPMigrants are one of the vulnerable communities around the world. We identified the issue in our programmes but could not make any intervention. Now we are preparing a project to do that intervention. In this project we are emphasising on labour migrants and cross border migrants. We have already built up some government infrastructures to provide HIV and STD services. Previously it was NGOs who led the HIV programmes, now the government is going to shoulder the responsibility. M.M NeazuddinM. M. Neazuddin, Secretary Health, Ministry of Health & Family WelfareThough Bangladesh is a low prevalent country we have to do many more things to keep it low . The information of 38 HIV-positive case diagnosed in VCT centre at district Govt. Hospitals of  Jessore and Satkhira supported CARE-Bangladesh is really alarming and we have to be really cautious about the issue of cross border migration and their vulnerability of getting infected. We have to immediately take some initiatives for the cross border migrants.  I am fully agreed with the urge of holding bilateral and multilateral discussion over the issue of cross border migration and HIV vulnerability with our neighbouring countries.","['mobility', 'need', 'bangladesh', 'workers', 'border', 'vulnerability', 'migration', 'emphasis', 'crossborder', 'issue', 'health', 'migrant', 'experience', 'hiv', 'migrants']","CARE Bangladesh and The Daily Star have recently organised a roundtable on ""Cross-Border Mobility andHIV Vulnerability: EMPHASIS Experience"".

It was confirmed that they were clean only after the DNA Polymer Chain Reaction test.Seven other women had miscarriages and seven are still under observation, the doctor said, adding that one baby could not be saved from the infection due to late detection of the disease of the mother.Once a pregnant woman is diagnosed with HIV she is immediately given antiretroviral therapy that suppresses HIV.

HIV/AIDS: Hold the scourge at bay,THE recent survey report by the National AIDS / STD Works Programme on the spread of HIV infection in a section of the intravenous drug users ( IDU ) in a certain area of Dhaka city is alarming. The report indicated that the prevalence of HIV among such drug users has reached as high as 10.5 per cent in that area (the name of the area has not been made public) of the city.,,2008-07-12T00:00:00+06:00,"THE recent survey report by the National AIDS / STD Works Programme on the spread of HIV infection in a section of the intravenous drug users ( IDU ) in a certain area of Dhaka city is alarming. The report indicated that the prevalence of HIV among such drug users has reached as high as 10.5 per cent in that area (the name of the area has not been made public)  of the city. ICDDR, B conducted the survey by collecting blood sample of more than 10,000  IDUs in selected 19 areas of the country and the result indicated   HIV infection among such users to be less than I per cent  but the average infection rate among IDUs in the Dhaka city has been found to be 7 per cent and in a certain area as high as said above. With prevalence rate of 5 per cent or more considered as epidemic for any disease, the large incidence of HIV infection in a concentrated population in the city is a chilling message to all vitally linked with the development of the country.While epidemiologists have long labeled Africa as a time bomb for the outbreak of afflictions such as AIDS, much of the world, more specifically India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Mynamar remained somewhat indifferent to the region's plight. The situation is set to change with a new World Bank report that brings the threat of AIDS  closer to home. The infection rate in Asia, says the report, will dwarf the health crisis Africans suffered over the past 15 years.According to the report, there are more than 8 million people infected with HIV or AIDS in Asia. What's worse, the number is expected to jump dramatically in the near future. The reason for the new outbreaks, says the report, is that most of Southeast Asia has reached a concentrated stage of infection. This means that the disease has reached high levels among those most at risk -- intravenous drug users and sex workers, -- and is set to creep into the rest of society.Speaking about India, on the most conservative of estimates, as per statistics taken in 2004, more than 600,000 already have the disease and more than 5m are infected with HIV. That means India ranks second only to South Africa in terms of its number of infections. If India's rate were to rise by just a few percentage points, not only would millions more there be condemned to live with -- or more likely die of -- AIDS, but so would millions of its neighbours, especially Bangladesh with 4222  km porous land border put to the risk.Precisely true, no country is condemned to follow Africa into an AIDS cauldron. The policies adopted by not so distant Thailand have the greatest relevance for us. The Thais adopted six policies in particular : evaluation and monitoring of the outbreak, a concentration of efforts on high risk groups, general education about HIV and AIDS, combined with a 100 per cent condom use programme and a campaign to dispel with the stigma associated with the disease, collaboration with as many people as possible on all fronts, international support and political will.Understandably, the growing number of HIV cases in India calls for stepping up efforts to halt the spread of the disease in our country through cross-border transmissions. The most worrying aspect is the trafficking of teenage girls to India who after being coerced into sex trade, eventually come back to Bangladesh with high probability of carrying with them the treaded HIV infection.The Home Adviser's disclosure while inaugurating a new police investigation unit formed to strengthen fight against human trafficking in the city in the recent past  as reported in The Daily Star on June 18 last  that every day about 50 Bangladeshi women were trafficked to India came as a bewildering shock to the nation. It was stated in the report that 400,000 Bangladeshi women were engaged in forced prostitution in India. The report further added that  40,000 female children were exploited in  Pakistan.Reports carried by a Chennai (India) based AIDS Research and Education Centre revealed that the centre was treating two sons of a wealthy industrialist for AIDS. The sons admitted that they had unprotected sex with “high class” call girls before and after marriage. Neither believed that there was any risk involved so long as they kept away from the official red light areas. “ Now their wives are also infected,” said the director of the centre glumly.Heterosexual transmission now accounts for over two-thirds of all HIV positive cases in underdeveloped countries like India, Uganda and other African countries. Contrarily, in Thailand  just within  three years since the beginning of 1996 the number of infected cases shot up from 1000 to 50,000 through intravenous drug users like that we see in Bangladesh now. Referring to the high incidence of HIV infection in an area of the city  Dr. Nazrul Islam, an  eminent HIV/ AIDS expert and Professor of Virology  at BSMMUH  said, “It's a concentrated epidemic in a small area  and must be construed as a red alert for a densely populated small country like Bangladesh.Either in India or Uganda or Thailand or our own country what we have got to be worried of is that promiscuity is the single most important way by which the epidemic spreads. One reason for its rapid dissemination is that symptoms take an average five years to show up, so an afflicted person can pass the virus unknowingly to scores of people. Moreover the middle class seldom believed that it was vulnerable to the insidious spread.AIDS is an expensive disease, expensive to prevent and expensive to treat. With a limited budget more money for prevention means less for treatment.  On the other hand without the promise of treatment no one has the incentive to be tested and without tests the disease will spread. . Then it will be apparent that AIDS is an expensive disease to neglect.UN experts have indicated that in the Asian region including India, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines and last of all Bangladesh, a disaster is waiting to happen. There are 5 million new cases every year, of which 58 per cent are people under 25.  About 10 million Asians have either HIV or full blown AIDS, including about 8 million in India which is a grim warning to Bangladesh.Till recently many people in our country considered AIDS a scourge of the libertine West that posed little threat to a conservative society like ours based on monogamous marriages. But Bangladesh has also hundreds of thousands of sailors, labourers of all varieties and other professional groups who work abroad for a time and a continual tide of businessmen and trafficked women beyond the borders of this country. Villages in Bangladesh, to say nothing of the cities and towns, are not, in fact, the bastions of sexual probity they are quaintly imagined to be. Studies have shown that Bangladesh society, long considered so conservative, is more footloose and sexually free than is commonly admitted. The incidence of HIV virus in an epidemic form in a concentrated zone in Dhaka city should serve as a wake up call for the government in power and the one that would be coming to power through a credible election.Md.

In 50 percent cases, the disease spreads through the people who belong to this age group. So, more attention should be given to the people belonging to this age brackets.Quoting a research finding, HIV/AIDS Sector Director of Save the Children USA Dr Nezam Uddin Ahmed said 90 percent children have ever heard about HIV/AIDS but only 25 percent of them know how it spreads. While two percent are going through a denial phase who think that they would not get infected with HIV/AIDS.Presenting a keynote paper, he said, “So, it is important to disseminate total messages among this group through proper channel,” adding that it is good that the government has introduced the issue of HIV/AIDS in school curriculum from grade 6 to 12.It would force the students to know about AIDS and take preventive measures and at the same time teachers' training in this regard would also be helpful for the students in getting clear messages, he added.Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Vice Chancellor Prof Nazrul Islam underscored the importance of providing proper care and treatment for the people living with HIV/AIDS or get HIV infected.“They should be taken care of for ensuring a better life while they must be registered and observed so that they cannot spread the deadly virus,” he said, adding that sex workers, injective drug users, males having sex with males, migrant and garment workers are belonging to most vulnerable groups and attention should be paid much to these groups especially.There are more than one lakh sex workers in the country. Every sex worker attends some five customers on an average every day and if the workers get infected with the disease, they would transmit the disease to five lakh people every day, he added.The speakers called on all to be a responsible citizen, live healthy life and take measures to prevent the disease like using condom during sexual intercourse, screening blood during blood transfusion and maintaining the religious norms.At the same time, the government should consider AIDS as a threat to the nation and move forward to address the issue with due commitment, they said, adding that mass media can also play an important role.Moderated by Dr Abdun Noor Tushar, the discussion was also addressed by Editor of the Prothom Alo Matiur Rahman, NASP Line Director Dr Md Ishak Khan, Treasurer of STD/AIDS Network Dr Nazneen Akhter, Executive Director of Ashar Alo Society Habiba Akter, Awami League leader Dr Dipu Moni, Shahnaz Begum of Durjay Nari Sangha and cultural activist Nasiruddin Yusuf Bachchu also spoke the discussion.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['discussion', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'workers', 'sex', 'aids', 'prevent', 'vulnerable', 'speakers', 'messages', 'awareness', 'dr']","It is time to disseminate complete messages among the people about HIV/AIDS properly so that they could be empowered and build strong resistance in the community against the disease, they added.

Prevention Of Hiv In Bangladesh,"Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque, UNFPA",,2013-12-01T00:00:19+06:00,"Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque, UNFPAToday's roundtable is part of our continuous advocacy in relation to HIV and SRH (Sexual and Reproductive Health). There is a key theme in the title: policy strategic plan and integration between human health and HIV. A question might be raised that why are we embarking on this issue?  First, if we can integrate SRH and HIV, it will ensure the financial sustainability of the programme in relation to SRH and HIV. Secondly, integration will increase the coverage of the programme in terms of geographic and per capita coverage. It will improve quality of services and reduce stigma discriminations in relation to HIV and SRH. These are the main purposes of integration of SRH and HIV. Let me give some examples of possible integration of HIV and SRH:1.     Transmission from mother to child is one of the ways of HIV transmission. If we consider maternal health and do integration of maternal health and HIV, there would be less risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. For example, if a mother is found HIV positive, she would be counseled for ARV and special services to reduce the risk of transmission. That is one justification for integration of HIV and maternal health.2.     Second example is of dual protection. Condom is used as a dual protection method:  family planning and prevention of HTI and HIV. If we consider our programme area in relation to family planning and HIV, my understanding and experience say that these two programs are being implemented in a vertical fashion.  HIV programme and family planning programme are doing the same condom promotion programme but in an incoherent manner. If we can integrate the HIV with the reproductive health, the large number of field workers of family planning programme can easily disseminate the little message about HIV in a short period of time to a large group of population.3.     If we can integrate the migration issue with the HIV, this can also reduce the risk of transmission as the person can take extra precaution during his stay outside the country.4.     The fourth is very common but not much talked about: the child marriage issue in relation to HIV. In a child marriage, the girl does not have any negotiation skill with her sexual partner. This can also increase the risk of transmission. We need to think how the child marriage issue can be related to HIV to prevent further transmission.5.     Fifth one is gender based violence and violence in general. For instance, gender discrimination and gender inequality actually disempower female counter part and she does not have any negotiation power over sex. If there is social and economical empowerment, the female counterpart will have a definite say for safe sex practice.These are the justifications why we have invited you. We want to have your insights regarding why we need such integration of HIV with the reproductive health. Please allow me to read the Toto Policy statement regarding this issue:1.     To device a national program,2.     To prevent and contain the spread of HIV infection as a part of Bangladesh's health system,3.     To involve all the government sectors and relevant government/non-government organizations to the fullest extent possible in planning, implementation of such program in conformity with global strategy.So, we have a strong justification why we need integration of HIV and SRH.Integration of HIV and SRH is very much related to our National AIDS STD Programme (NASP) which is endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In the third objective it says, “To strengthen the coordination mechanism and management capacity at different levels to ensure an effective multi-sector HIV response”.In the strategies and plans of the same document, it says that the multi-sector engagement of the HIV epidemic is very complex. It is felt across the society involving individuals, families, sectors and institutions. It, therefore, goes beyond the domain of the heath sectors and an effective response to it must be multi-sectoral. So, if I again refer back to the title, we have a very strong ground and documented justification in relation to policy document and strategic plan. It clearly asks for integration of HIV and reproductive health program. Despite clear policy guidance and our commitment, we are still doing the HIV and reproductive health programmes in a discrete fashion.It is also important to integrate our funds for HIV and SRH. If a donor only funds for HIV then it is really difficult for the implementing agency to go beyond the donor's mandate. So our donors have to be aware of the issue of integration. Without administrative and financial integration support, implementation of integrated programmes cannot be successful.Though we have large fund being provided for HIV, still there are gaps. To fill the gaps, we can integrate the services of the other sectors. For example, we can integrate health, education, gender, population and so on. I agree, this is a low prevalent country and unlike Africa and the other high prevalent countries, the integration is not so important. But we need to integrate HIV and SRH to continue the low prevalence effectively. And the integration programme should be mainstreamed.Dr. Halidah Khandaker, Executive Director, Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP)In 1995/96, AIDS Committee developed a strategy. There was an indication for integration of HIV/AIDS with STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) prevention. Although there was no mention of MCH (Maternal and Child Health), STD was one of the features.  The strategy had four objectives:1.     Prevention of transmission of HIV;2.     Reduce the impact of HIV infection;3.     Prevention of STD;4.     Management of STD.I do not know how it was separated again and why it did not work. From the observation, age and experience with many departments of obstetric gynecology, STD and HIV infection I can say integration has many good sides, especially for women. Because, if a woman gets chance to get all the services from one place, for her it becomes beneficial to come and take the services. As you know, women are always neglected and they hardly get any chance to come to hospital or come to take other services, except during delivery or pregnancy. About that also I am very doubtful because most of the deliveries are being done at home than in the center. So, in that case, when a woman gets chance to have MCH services, she can get the services of STD also. And if she can also get the services of detection for HIV also, then she can get three or four services from one place. That will reduce her husband's burden to bring her to the hospital repeatedly. It will also reduce the cost of healthcare.As HIV and STD spread almost by the same method of sexual transmission, the prevention is also the same. For instance, a woman can ask her husband to use condom to have less children. So, then she will have good health and will have a reduced chance of getting HIV infection from her husband or vice versa. Condom promotion can help this. This is not only beneficial for women, but for men also, because they are the ones who will be providing the sustenance for their wives and children.I want to urge our authorities to integrate HIV especially with MCH. Because when a woman cannot get the chance to detect if she is positive or negative, she can come to the MCH centre. She will have some blood test and during that time she can have the HIV test also. So, that becomes very easy for her to get to know the status. And when she knows the status, she can get the chance of having the condom; have fewer children and less infection.She may not be infected at all, or the child may not be infected at all. You can make conditions like “I have told you before.” And the other thing is that it is man's responsibility to spare or reduce the chance of infection, i.e. by using condom. So HIV should be integrated with family planning also. And my idea is to integrate  the three services: HIV, STD and Family Planning. Only one condom can save many lives. So, why will men be reluctant?I am not a feminist. I am a mother, a wife and I love my husband and my children. I love my family and I wanted to be a house-wife which I do love. Still, this is true that men have to realize. I may not ask my husband whether he is having affair with other lady but I should have the courage to speak it out some other way. If the husband becomes responsible then I will tell him that, “I do not care how many women you are having affairs with; but when you have affairs with me then please use the condom.” I think, the men here would agree with me. Clockwise from top left: Dr. K K Ezazul Haque, Dr. Halidah Khandaker, ABM Kamrul Hasan, Dr.Ishrat Jahan, Dr. Abdul Waheed, Leo Kenny, M A Siddiqui, Cdre (Rtd.) Nurul Amin Chowdhury, Shashish Shami Kamal, Dr. Muhammad Munir Hussain, Dr. Samir Kumar Howlader, Ali Reza, Dr. Tajuddin Oyeware, Saleh Ahmed.Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueThere is some confusion about the integration issue. One clinic is doing the STI (sexually transmitted infections) services and they are also providing the HIV services. They say that they are doing integration. We are not here to discuss that issue actually; we are saying the integration in relation to the mainstream and linkage.Since we do not have policy, strategic, management, administrative and financial support for the integration programme from the centre level, it will be very sporadic and it will have minimal impact. That is why we are urging again that we need government support not only from the MOHFW but also from all other relevant ministries.If we consider maternal health, we do not need to implement the integration issue in all the maternal health clinics in the same way. What is required is that we have to select the area, the population group and who are at risk – then only we can specifically counsel them in a maternal health setting and find the risk of transmission from their body to the coming child. That is the main purpose.ABM Kamrul Hasan, Programme Coordinator, UNODCWe have a policy document on HIV AIDS, which was officially endorsed perhaps 20 years back in 1997. The journey started in around 1994/95. At that time most of the Asian countries did not have any policy regarding HIV/AIDS. Later on, we prepared the strategic document -- National HIV AIDS Strategy. In terms of policy and strategy, it was fantastic. The country was in a very good position. After 20 years, we have to re-think whether we should go back again to the policy, whether we should update, whether we should revise the policy or not. That is very important because the situation has changed in a multifarious way. We should be at per with the change.At that time our focus was just to combat HIV. We did not realise its relation with other health issues. If you go through the policy, it will say everywhere that, the other reproductive health issue was not considered very much.  For example,we  only focused upon the injecting drug users, but not about other injecting forms and other drugs. We did not address how the young generation was induced with the illicit drugs and what is the relation between reproductive health and HIV. That time these issues were not discussed nor addressed. After 20 years it is very important to look back again to that policy.When we talk about integration we have to consider the issue of human resource for health. Who are the main implementers of our health programmes? Each and every union has a union FWC (Family Welfare Center). In most unions we have the union sub centre. In Upazila, we have Upazila Health Centre. They are the main providers of reproductive health services. We have to integrate our HIV /AIDS programme with these mainstream providers of health and family planning services.We have also facilitated community health service. If we go back to the policy and strategy, we must consider broader perspective rather than only focusing on HIV or STI. For example, child-marriage, adolescent-pregnancy, illicit drugs taken by young generation are really pertinent issues related to reproductive health, which make individuals vulnerable to HIV/STI. HIV or STI infection is the outcome of many issues. All we need to do is to address all the pertinent issues so that we can cut the HIV infection or STI occurrences. It is our goal. We should provide more adolescent friendly health services because they often think that they don't require any healthcare.Our SRH and family planning programmes are very much focused on married couple. There is a large section of unmarried man and women who also need SRH and family planning services.We have to incorporate some life skill programmes in our SRH and HIV policies. It is important for the young and adolescents.Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueMDG and ICPD policy documents are very relevant to this linkage issue. I want to quote from the ICPD document: ""information, education and counseling for responsible sexual behaviour and effective transmission of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV should become integral component to all SRH services"". We are a signatory to the ICPD Programme of Action. So we are obliged to formulate and implement programmes in an integrated way.Dr. Ishrat Jahan, Programme Manager, Adolescent and Reproductive Health, DGFPDGFP can do a lot in terms of providing integrated services. We have large number of field level workers. We can employ them in integrated services.In our country women only come to hospital when it is an urgent issue. From the gender perspective it can be said that sometimes they are not allowed to come. When they come to our service centres we screen them and make them aware about HIV issues.I have doubts about the quality of knowledge of our service providers on HIV. So training for the field workers on HIV is urgently needed.DGFP provide some SRH services to adolescents. In different districts we conduct awareness campaign on this issue.  We are also talking about preventing child marriage and adolescent pregnancy. We need to add some information about HIV and high risk behaviour with SRH. Now we are reviewing our adolescent reproductive health strategy. We have already finalized reproductive health action plan. We will disseminate the action plan soon. In the new action plan we have committed to do more about adolescent reproductive health.In our reproductive health programs we should include the HIV issue. In our family planning centres we should have some diagnosis facility for women who are at risk, for example women who have husbands living abroad or addicted or open to high risk behaviour. It is important because there is a risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child.My next point is safe blood transfusion. In delivery section,when any emergency situation arises we need lot of blood.That's why it is very important to screen blood properly in delivery centres. Otherwise it can cause HIV infection to both mother and child.We have to promote only condom. We have to inform people about the dual use of condom: family planning and prevent HIV and STD.We should focus more on men. If they are aware then it becomes easy for his spouse to maintain a safe sexual and reproductive health. So men should be incorporated in our campaign.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Dr. Abdul Waheed, Line Director, NASPHow human resource for health and HIV prevention should be linked is an important question. In our national strategy it is clearly explained. But we are not implementing it. So we have to think how to implement it.We are doing different things in different ways. For example, DGFP and DGHS are doing things according to their own plans. But there should be a linkage at some point. That point should be at the service level.Leo Kenny, Country Director, UNAIDSIt is widely recognized that we can get better results by avoiding parallel health system. It needs to be done not only in terms of SRH and HIV but also in range of services such as TB, MCH etc. In this age countries can not afford not to do it because it means efficient use of resources is not being made. By 2015, we should achieve the desired progress in linkage issue.Improvement of linkage between HIV and sexual reproductive health is very important. If a country does not make enough progress it is because of the following reasons: your analysis of the service delivery is flawed; you are not doing enough to ensure  linkage between the service systems to promote maternal health and health of children; weak health systems and lack of an entry point to address sexual and gender based violence; you are not doing enough to ensure linkage among MDG 3,4,5 and 6.We are not harnessing the opportunity of using the HIV entry point to address the MCH issues, we need to harmonize the funding of HIV and SRH; we are not strengthening capacity of our service providers to link between SRH and HIV.There are also some legal barriers to this integration effort. That happens to key population like transgender, sex workers, people injecting drugs, men having sex with men and adolescent population who do not have access to health services.We must do more to address stigma and discrimination, including removal of punitive laws and policies that block access to services of those people who are most at risk.Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueI want to quote some lines from the 2010 ANGUS Report: ""Response to HIV in Bangladesh is provided through multiple funders and multiple implementers. Lack of smooth coordination among player is a major hindrance to providing quality services. In Bangladesh multiple ministries need to be involved to ensure key services. This is not carried out effectively. Roles and responsibilities of designated focul points in 16 ministries need to be clarified and reactivated."" This is very important. We have 16 HIV focal points in 16 ministries. If we can activate the integration process will be smoother.M A Siddiqui, ColumnistEducation is an important means to disseminate HIV information. Our education curriculum should include comprehensive reproductive health education.We can talk about SRH in forums but not in our families. We should come out of such stigma.Dr. Halidah KhandakerI want to tell our parents to take courage and talk to your children about SRH and HIV issues. When we first went for campaign in schools, the headmaster asked us only to take science students. I had to fight with them to make them understand that the student from Arts background would also be a man or women. So take courage and be careful.Saleh Ahmed , ED, Bondhu Social Welfare SocietyAmong the transgender community we only provide condom and STI services. But we are not able provide them other SRH services. So they remain vulnerable. There is also an important issue of access for the transgender community.Providing SRH services can not be separated from the livelihood issue. Our transgender community has very little access to formal job market. That's why they have to opt for risky professions for earning livelihood. It makes them more vulnerable to HIV/ AIDS.When we talk about gender-based violence we do not count the transgender. They are also victims of different kind of violence. There should be strong punitive measures in case of violence against transgender and feminine male.There is a large group of man having sex with man. Most of them start practicing this risky behaviour at the adolescent age. According to our government policy they are considered children and we cannot promote condom among children. But adolescents come to our centres and we are providing them condoms but we cannot register their name. So in policy formulation we have to also consider these issues.Dr. Tajuddin Oyeware, Chief, HIV/ AIDS , UnicefEvery child has a right to survive. Meaning that when it is born, it has the right to born free of HIV. Within that framework we look at the issue of HIV. We have to explore opportunities that bring about efficiency of investment and effectiveness of intervention. And to do that integration and linkage is central.  If we go about doing parallel programme we will not achieve anything. It will be expensive. There will be lot of duplication and wastages. We do not have any other options than to push hard for integration and linkages. For that we need to do something at policy level. UNICEF unequivocally supports linkages between SRH and HIV.I want to focus on two important groups: adolescents and pregnant mothers. They are the continuum of cares. At the pre-pregnant period, what does the girl need? She needs good reproductive health and to be free of HIV. She needs HIV counseling and testing. And how do you implement HIV counseling and testing if you do not integrate SRH and HIV counseling? When one visits a SRH expert he or she can ask for HIV testing. Even to prevent the transmission of HIV from the mother to the child, contraceptive is critical .When a mother decides not to be a pregnant, a child cannot be infected. The important topic about which we do not talk much is that when a mother is HIV positive she needs access to family planning method to delay pregnancy or not to be pregnant at all.When a mother is pregnant, the matter of integration comes again. MCH service providers can easily provide HIV testing and counseling services. It is the best place to do that.Bangladesh has made massive progress in cutting down the rate of under-five mortality. We have to integrate early infection diagnosis for the infants at the point of neonatal care.Bangladesh has all the ingredients to do a successful integration but we need to join them together. 2014 is the best time to do that because at that time we will do the midterm review of National HIV/AIDS strategy . At that time, midterm review of the National Health Population Sector Wide Programme will also be held.  So we have a great opportunity to link all these together.Ali Reza, OIC, UNICAwareness requires dissemination of proper information. It leads to understanding. Understanding leads to awareness. Awareness leads to actions. And positive actions lead to change. And this change makes the desired goal of a nation. Since the young generation is the agent of change we have to talk about our youths when we talk about any integration. We have to know the need of reproductive health services of the young population. We mostly focus  upon vulnerable groups. But there are large number of young groups who are out of the counting but equally vulnerable to HIV infection.We want other daily newspapers to come forward like The Daily Star in holding discussion on HIV issues and make our citizens aware. Among the TV channel only the state run BTV shows HIV related programmes. There are many channels in our country that do everything except showing any programme on  HIV. We urge them to allow some slots for dissemination of HIV information. Mainstream radio channels as well as community radio channels should also join the campaign.In many cases, educated people, even doctors, are not aware about AIDS infection. I know someone whose wife got infected during delivery of her child. One of her relatives donated her blood during emergency delivery operation. The blood screening system was poor. So she got infected. In many renowned hospitals in the country blood screening is not properly done. We should also emphasise on this issue.I would urge to observe International AIDS Day in all educational institutions. Our schools should teach students about SRH and HIV. The students will further disseminate the message..Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueUNFPA have recently started a radio ad on HIV in Dhaka FM. It is a 30 seconds slot and  will be aired 60 times in 24 hours for 40 days.Dr. Samir Kumar Howlader, National Programme Officer, IOMLinkage at the service level is not possible without linkage at the strategic and policy level. Mostly we do some sporadic work of integration at the field level that in the long run fails to sustain due to lack of proper policies of integration at the national level.Integration will bear good results if we consider the vulnerability of the migrant workers. They are termed emerging vulnerable population in the third national strategic plan. We did some sporadic work for migrant workers to prevent HIV infection like pre-departure orientation and linkages to service providers after they are back. But we do not have any policy for their spouses. This is an important area of integration. If we integrate SRH with HIV, then the spouses who stay back in the home country can access the SRH services as well as HIV consultation.Why do we not include unmarried young people? We only work for married couple. We should focus on unmarried young people.When we talk about multi-ministerial involvement we know that there are 16 ministries that are involved in the committee on HIV and HIV focal points are there. I do not know if Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Development is involved there. If they are not involved then nothing can be done successfully for the migrants.Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueIt is really a challenge to follow up HIV issues of an immigrant from country of origin to country of destination. We have to address the challenge seriously.Dr. Muhammad Munir Hussain, Project Manager, Plan International BangladeshWe are overburdened with policies and strategies. I want to emphasise on mainstreaming, both internally and externally. Different ministries have different policies. We have to know if there is something about HIV. Then we have to coordinate those policies with the national HIV policy.We have incorporated HIV issues in our secondary school curriculum. In 2012, we have also incorporated different SRH issues in the curriculum of secondary school. Now, it is not just about small family.  In the curriculum, we have discussed adolescent reproductive health and family planning issues, in details. But we need to train our school teachers so that they can teach these things in a student-friendly way.Shashish Shami Kamal, Youth Member, UNFPA Youth GroupTo reach the critical youth population we have to involve the youths themselves in our campaign. Then it will be easier to reach young people and create a lasting impact upon them. When I was a member of an anti-smoking group, we undertook an anti-smoking campaign and involved some of the smokers. It worked like a miracle. They motivated others not to smoke and some of them broke the bad habit.We need more research on men and masculinity. Masculinity is socially constructed. Masculinity breeds some negative ideals that attract young boys. Young people are curious about everything under the sun and get involved in various harmful practices just out of curiosity and manipulated by different patriarchal constructions of manhood. It may be injecting drugs, having multiple partners and so on, which make them vulnerable to HIV and STDs. So we have to work on the idea of masculinity and fight out wrong notions of manhood. We need to understand the young man, his ideas and his curiosity and reach them with information about HIV and SRH in ingenuous ways. The masculinity issue should also be included in the HIV research paradigm.Another important issue is using ICT in dissemination of information about HIV. We can also make communication channels so that one can get HIV and SRH service related information over phone or via internet without disclosing his or her identity.Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueWe need to work more on leadership issue to raise the voices of young people. We want to see youth-friendly programs and services .  DGFP has already introduced some adolescent friendly services.Cdre (Rtd.) Nurul Amin Chowdhury, Programme Advisor, RTM InternationalOur strategy should be sensitive to our social reality. In village areas, it is still difficult to talk about HIV. We have to reach them in innovative ways and help get rid of the social stigma about HIV. We have to provide HIV related information and SRH services in an integration package so that people can also understand linkage between HIV and SRH and do not shy away from the services.Dr. Ishrat JahanWe are not providing contraceptive to unmarried adolescents. But there are large numbers of unmarried adolescents who are involved in sexual activities.  They are high-risk group. We do not even register their names; even there is no column in the register book for unmarried adolescents. This is an important area to work on. To provide them contraceptives we have to change our policy. Our policies are solely focused on married couples. We should change our perception and incorporate unmarried adolescents in our services.Dr. K.K Ezazul HaqueUNFPA has strong mandate to work on integration of HIV and SRH issues. We are trying our best to do so. We are providing training to service providers to build their capacity on delivering integrated services. We are also providing technical assistance to NASP. UNFPA has closely worked with the government to formulate a communication strategy for integrated services. We have learnt a lot from today's roundtable. We will incorporate your recommendations and work together for creating an effective linkage between HIV and SRH.UNFPA and The Daily Star jointly organized a roundtable on 'Prevention of HIV inBangladesh' recently. Below we publish a summary of the discussions -- Editor","['prevention', 'need', 'bangladesh', 'reproductive', 'issue', 'health', 'integration', 'services', 'programme', 'hiv', 'policy', 'srh']","First, if we can integrate SRH and HIV, it will ensure the financial sustainability of the programme in relation to SRH and HIV.
If we consider maternal health and do integration of maternal health and HIV, there would be less risk of HIV transmission from mother to child.
HIV programme and family planning programme are doing the same condom promotion programme but in an incoherent manner.
One clinic is doing the STI (sexually transmitted infections) services and they are also providing the HIV services.
If we integrate SRH with HIV, then the spouses who stay back in the home country can access the SRH services as well as HIV consultation."
New guidance on HIV self-testing,The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released new guidelines on HIV self-testing to improve access to and uptake of HIV diagnosis.,,2016-12-04T00:00:00+06:00,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released new guidelines on HIV self-testing to improve access to and uptake of HIV diagnosis.According to a new WHO progress report lack of an HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to implementing the Organisation’s recommendation that everyone with HIV should be offered antiretroviral therapy (ART).The report reveals that more than 18 million people with HIV are currently taking ART, and a similar number is still unable to access treatment, the majority of which are unaware of their HIV positive status.Today, 40% of all people with HIV (over 14 million) remain unaware of their status. Many of these are people at higher risk of HIV infection who often find it difficult to access existing testing services.HIV self-testing means people can use oral fluid or blood- finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results are ready within 20 minutes or less. Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services.HIV self-testing is a way to reach more people with undiagnosed HIV and represents a step forward to empower individuals, diagnose people earlier before they become sick, bring services closer to where people live, and create demand for HIV testing. This is particularly important for those people facing barriers to accessing existing services.HIV testing coverage remains low among various population groups. For example, global coverage rates for all HIV testing, prevention, and treatment are lower among men than women.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Men account for only 30% of people who have tested for HIV. As a result, men with HIV are less likely to be diagnosed and put on antiretroviral treatment and are more likely to die of HIV-related causes than women.But some women miss out too. Adolescent girls and young women in East and Southern Africa experience infection rates up to eight times higher than among their male peers. Fewer than one in every five girls (15–19 years of age) are aware of their HIV status.Testing also remains low among ""key populations"" and their partners - particularly men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and people in prisons - who comprise approximately 44% of the 1.9 million new adult HIV infections that occur each year.Up to 70 % of partners of people with HIV are also HIV positive. Many of those partners are not currently getting tested. The new WHO guidelines recommend ways to help HIV positive people notify their partners about their status, and also encourage them to get tested.Self-testing has been shown to nearly double the frequency of HIV testing among men who have sex with men, and recent studies in Kenya found that male partners of pregnant women had twice the uptake of HIV testing when offered self-testing compared with standard testing.Twenty three countries currently have national policies that support HIV self-testing. Many other countries are developing policies, but wide-scale implementation of HIV self-testing remains limited. WHO supports free distribution of HIV self-test kits and other approaches that allow self-test kits to be bought at affordable prices. WHO is also working to reduce costs further to increase access. The new guidance aims to help countries scale up implementation.","['access', 'men', 'guidance', 'positive', 'women', 'hiv', 'testing', 'partners', 'treatment', 'status', 'selftesting']","The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released new guidelines on HIV self-testing to improve access to and uptake of HIV diagnosis.

Elimination of HIV and syphilis in Cuba,Cuba became the first country in the world to receive validation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has eliminated mother-,,2015-08-09T00:00:00+06:00,"Cuba became the first country in the world to receive validation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.Every year, globally, an estimated 1.4 million women living with HIV become pregnant. Untreated, they have a 15-45% chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. However, that risk drops to just over 1% if antiretroviral medicines are given to both mothers and children throughout the stages when infection can occur.Nearly 1 million pregnant women worldwide are infected with syphilis annually. However, simple, cost-effective screening and treatment options during pregnancy, such as penicillin, can eliminate most of these complications.Mother-to-child transmission of these diseases is considered eliminated when the rates of infection are brought to levels so low as to be considered no longer a public health problem. In the case of HIV, this is defined as fewer than 2 in every 100 babies born to women with HIV, which is the lowest rate considered possible with the prevention methods currently available. In the case of syphilis, elimination is defined as less than 1 case for every 2,000 live births.As part of the regional initiative, Cuba has worked to ensure early access to prenatal care, HIV and syphilis testing for both pregnant women and their partners, treatment for women who test positive and their babies, substitution of breastfeeding, and prevention of HIV and syphilis before and during pregnancy through condom use and other prevention measures. As a result of these efforts, in 2013, only two babies were born with HIV in Cuba, and only three were born with congenital syphilis — reflecting transmission rates below the elimination thresholds.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'pregnancy', 'considered', 'pregnant', 'case', 'elimination', 'women', 'transmission', 'cuba', 'hiv', 'syphilis']","Cuba became the first country in the world to receive validation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.

HIV goal to treat 15m met,"The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency.",,2015-07-14T17:26:00+06:00,"The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency.The landmark figure was reached in March - nine months ahead of schedule.It follows decades of global efforts and investment to get antiretroviral drugs to those in need - such as people living in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2000, when the UN first set goals to combat HIV, fewer than 700,000 people were receiving these vital medicines.According to UN Aids, which has a report out today, the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new HIV infections and nearly eight million Aids-related deaths since the millennium.Over the same time frame, new HIV infections have fallen from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have gone down from 1.6 million to 1.2 million.Meanwhile, global investment in HIV has gone up from £3.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to more than £13bn ($20bn) in 2014.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  And concerted action over the next five years could end the Aids epidemic by 2030, says UN Aids.But progress has been slower in some areas.ENDING AIDSA major gap seems to be in awareness of HIV status, which is the biggest barrier to treatment access, says the report.And treatment access for children has lagged behind adults - although this is now improving.The proportion of children living with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2010 and 2014 (from 14% to 32%), but coverage ""remains notably lower than it does for adults"", says the report.Even though new HIV infections have gone down, there is still an unacceptable number of new HIV infections each year, contributing to the burden of the epidemic.In 2014, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections. And at the last headcount, there were an estimated 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. The estimated count for the whole world was 36.9 million.This year sees the switch from Millennium Development Goals to broader Sustainable Development Goals.Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations said: ""The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic.""Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.""The report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to ""sprint"" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030.","['gone', 'epidemic', '15m', 'treat', 'goal', 'infections', 'aids', 'million', 'treatment', 'met', 'hiv', 'global', 'living', 'investment']","The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency.

AIDS patients deprived of proper care,"The number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing in the country but they are not getting proper treatment as the lone Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) is yet to provide antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for these patients since it is very expensive. The IDH is providing treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS patients since 1989. But the government-owned Essential Drugs Company does not produce ARV, and it is not supplied to the IDH due to its high price, hospital sources said.",,2008-04-18T00:00:00+06:00,"The number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing in the country but they are not getting proper treatment as the lone Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) is yet to provide antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for these patients since it is very expensive.The IDH is providing treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS patients since 1989. But the government-owned Essential Drugs Company does not produce ARV, and it is not supplied to the IDH due to its high price, hospital sources said.“A person living with HIV/AIDS needs antiretroviral worth Tk 6,000 to Tk 10,000 every month. But the hospital does not have any special funds for HIV/AIDS patients, and it is not possible for the hospital with its limited funds to spend the huge amount of money needed for them,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Selimuzzaman of the IDH.“We just provide them treatment for opportunistic infections that occur due to collapse of the immune system of HIV/AIDS patients although they need psychological and nutritional support, opportunistic infection management and  antiretroviral therapy at a time,” he said. The IDH can provide around 50 percent of drugs required for AIDS patients, he added.Non-government organisations (NGOs) working with people having HIV/AIDS however reported that patients get only 20-30 percent drugs for opportunistic infections, and no ARV, at the IDH.“Worldwide there are 20 types of ARV for treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. But we can provide only four types of ARV to our patients with interrupted supply. And there are at least 100 registered patients who need ARV badly but we cannot provide it,” said Asma Parvin, programme manager of Ashar Alo Society (AAS).“Antiretroviral drugs should be included in the essential drugs list,” said Lazeena Muna, social mobilisation and partnerships adviser of UNAIDS. An ARV drug policy is needed immediately for uninterrupted flow of these drugs, she stressed.She pointed out that a draft ARV drug policy was crafted a few months ago with no further progress in this regard .The IDH does not have even the machine for counting CD 4 cells that determine immune status of a HIV/AIDS patient.Patients now have to go to the ICDDR,B for counting CD4 cells, spending Tk 2,500 each. The counting is essential to assess whether ARV is needed or not. If CD4 cells decrease to 200, it becomes urgent to treat such patients with ARV, experts said.Sources noted that HIV/AIDS patients also find it difficult to have treatment at the   public hospitals due to stigma.Meanwhile, the National HIV and AIDS Communication Strategy 2005--2010 emphasised that all public hospitals should provide treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.The National Strategic Plan has set the goal of ensuring that any one infected with HIV /AIDS has access to comprehensive systems of care, support and treatment by the year 2010.Talking to The Daily Star, AAS authorities said that in December last year, an AIDS patient referred to the IDH was asked to go for surgery as he had developed gangrene due to arsenicosis. But it took three months for the patient to under surgery as no private clinics wanted to admit the patient.When contacted,  Professor of Virology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Mohammad Nazrul Islam said the government should launch  an anti-stigma programme concerning HIV/AIDS at health care centres. And it should start from the centres near voluntary counselling and testing centres as the diagnosis process begins there (testing centres).Unless there are treatment support facilities near the counselling and testing centres, HIV/AIDS patients would be left in a more vulnerable position.There are around 1,200 reported HIV/AIDS cases in the country and about 7,500, unreported cases, official sources said.The Commission on AIDS in Asia in a report said, nearly five million people are living with HIV in Asia with 440, 000 people dying each year. An additional eight million people will be  infected by 2020.The death toll can be kept to less than 300,000 in 2020, saving the lives of more than 200,000 people each year.Governments must establish and maintain systems that provide continuous and sustainable access to antiretroviral therapy for all who need it, by ensuring affordability, availability, accessibility and adherence, the commission said.AIDS begins with HIV infection. People infected with HIV may have no symptoms for 10 years or longer, but they can still transmit the infection to others during this symptom-free period. But, if the infection is not detected and treated, the immune system gradually weakens, and AIDS develops.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'proper', 'idh', 'patients', 'aids', 'infection', 'arv', 'provide', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'deprived', 'care', 'drugs']","The IDH can provide around 50 percent of drugs required for AIDS patients, he added.

Mainstream HIV issue for effective prevention,Participants at a roundtable on 'Mainstreaming of HIV: Role of Leadership in Bangladesh' jointly organised by The Daily Star and UNFPA at the newspaper's office in the city yesterday.Photo: STAR,,2008-12-05T00:00:00+06:00,"Participants at a roundtable on 'Mainstreaming of HIV: Role of Leadership in Bangladesh' jointly organised by The Daily Star and UNFPA at the newspaper's office in the city yesterday.Photo: STARSpeakers at a roundtable yesterday underscored the need for mainstreaming the HIV/AIDS issue to help raise awareness and provide cost-effective service.The roundtable titled 'Mainstreaming of HIV: Role of leadership in Bangladesh' was organised jointly by the UNFPA and The Daily Star at its conference room in the city.The speakers said mainstreaming of HIV would also help in removing stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), utilising service delivery and ensuring human and reproductive rights.While delivering the keynote paper Khandaker Ezazul Hoque, HIV officer of UNFPA Bangladesh, said mainstreaming is a process that enables development actors to address the cause and effect of HIV/AIDS.In his welcome speech, Pornchai Suchitta, deputy representative of UNFPA Bangladesh, said multi-sectoral response is important for effective prevention of HIV.“People of this country are now more pro-active and willing to talk about HIV and AIDS. What we need now is to harmonize our efforts for meaningful result,” he said, adding that big population in the country is a big challenge to keep the prevalence of HIV low and more advocacy is needed in this regard.Highlighting the government's initiatives in combating HIV/AIDS, Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad, additional secretary to health and family welfare ministry, said, “AIDS is not only a burden for health but also a burden for development as it affects our productivity and household income.”It is a threat for the country and the nation, he added.It is time to review the National HIV/AIDS Policy which was formulated in 1997 as by this time situation has changed much, said Dr Mozammel Haque of UNODC.He said policy makers should think of allocating budget from revenue sector in future rather than depending on just donor agencies to work on HIV/AIDS.The speakers said  the programmes on IDUs and high risk groups and PLWHA should not be stopped for a single day while the issue of HIV/AIDS should be incorporated in the curriculum of non formal education also as it is introduced in formal education system.Expressing optimism focusing the activities of the government and non-government organisations on this issue they said Bangladesh is in right track to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) that targets the halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015.The speakers also recommended focusing on motivation about HIV/AIDS prevention, conducting more researches on AIDS related issues, access to government level data relating to AIDS/HIV should be easy for people, talking to the youth and other vulnerable groups before adopting any policy and strategy, increasing budget for AIDS prevention programme, conducting continuous monitoring and evaluation of AIDS prevention programme.Habiba Akter of Ashar Alo Society, Shale Ahmed of Bandhu Social Welfare Society, Tasnim Azim of ICDDR,B, Dr M Ziya Uddin and Dr Ferdous Alam Shibib of NASP,  Zaglul Ahmed Chowdhury, chief editor of BSS, Dr Zaman Ara of UNFPA, Farhana Haque of IUB, Mahfuza Rahman of Unesco, Zamiur Rahman of mass communication department, Parveen Rasheed of SMC, Avra Saha of UNAIDS, Moogdho Mim Mahzab and Saeda Bilkis Bani of UNFPA, Shah H Imam and Shahnoor Wahid of The Daily Star also spoke on the occasion.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'effective', 'hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'policy', 'mainstreaming', 'aids', 'hiv', 'speakers', 'issue', 'dr', 'unfpa', 'mainstream']","Speakers at a roundtable yesterday underscored the need for mainstreaming the HIV/AIDS issue to help raise awareness and provide cost-effective service.

"The Paris Statement: ""HIV Science Matters""","Scientific knowledge is the backbone of the HIV response. Over the past 30 years, scientific research has shaped and influenced our",,2017-07-30T00:00:00+06:00,"Scientific knowledge is the backbone of the HIV response. Over the past 30 years, scientific research has shaped and influenced our understanding and management of HIV and has pointed continually to better ways to reduce or prevent HIV-related illnesses, improve lives for people living with HIV and prevent new infections. Science drives the HIV response. Yet the extraordinary scientific progress against HIV and the ability to address all of the scientific challenges still are threatened by a weakening resolve to fund HIV science.We cannot achieve ambitious global goals, provide life-long treatment to the 37 million people living with HIV and reduce the epidemic without an unfaltering commitment to research. Progress in HIV science has far-reaching synergistic effects across public health, informing and supporting the response to other disease areas.Political commitment to sustained and predictable investment in a robust HIV science agenda must be strengthened to ensure that scientific progress against the epidemic is maximised and that gains are not lost.Understanding HIV and its interactions with its host at the most fundamental level requires continuing investment in basic science. Current research priorities include the analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HIV persistence and viral control. To enhance research efforts towards an HIV cure, animal models and promising new technologies must be funded.Controlling the global epidemic requires a vaccine and an ongoing and consistent commitment to investigating new approaches to vaccine development for both prophylactic and therapeutic use. Research efforts must include the characterisation of different cellular and humoral immune responses to be harnessed in the development of preventive vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Improving HIV treatment options and outcomes for the millions of people who need it requires research on drug formulations and adherence support. These efforts should prioritise the development of antiretroviral (ARV) formulations that support long-term adherence and reduce the risk of viral resistance. Cooperation between HIV, TB and cryptococcosis research programmes must be promoted. Implementation science must continue to inform retention approaches across “Test-Treat-Retain”, including new modalities for repeat testing in high-incidence settings, routine viral load monitoring, improved client adherence strategies and the adoption of differentiated service delivery models.Prevention options must be accessible to and useful for the people who need them most. Investment in prevention and overcoming structural barriers should focus on improving access to diversified prevention tools, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), for people most vulnerable to HIV infection. Prevention research must continue to support the development and scale up of combination prevention, notably for key populations, migrants and the younger generation with a gender-sensitive approach. Research priorities in the humanities and social sciences must address stigma and discrimination and identify tailored approaches to reduce the drivers of the epidemic.Beyond the laboratory and clinical trial setting, investments that better explore economics and financing are essential to supporting a sustained response and the creation of innovative financing models. Research must continue to inform thinking on pricing models for HIV diagnostics and medicines, as well as treatments for co-infections, that are modified in particular for low- and middle-income countries and take into consideration the expanded role of generics and bio-equivalents. Political and economic sciences must focus on existing financing gaps and work towards models that expand universal health coverage.The HIV epidemic is far from over. Expanding the evidence base to guide policy and programme decisions is a key component in addressing critical research gaps. Multi-disciplinary approaches and research programmes adapted to a range of social and cultural contexts must be allowed to flourish; participatory and community-based research must be strengthened; and the meaningful involvement of key populations and people living with HIV in shaping research priorities must remain an unwavering principle.HIV science matters. Ending the epidemic requires the continued contribution of and investment in science.","['prevention', 'statement', 'matters', 'epidemic', 'reduce', 'models', 'response', 'research', 'science', 'requires', 'hiv', 'scientific', 'paris']","Science drives the HIV response.

HIV pandemic's roots traced back to 1920s Kinshasa,"About 2880 candles are seen lit during a World AIDS Day event in Jakarta December 1, 2009.

Photo: ReutersThe origin of the Aids pandemic has been traced to the 1920s in the city of Kinshasa, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, scientists say.An international team of scientists say a ""perfect storm"" of population growth, sex and railways allowed HIV to spread.A feat of viral archaeology was used to find the pandemic's origin, the team report in the journal Science.They used archived samples of HIV's genetic code to trace its source, with evidence pointing to 1920s Kinshasa.Their report says a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics probably spread the virus.Meanwhile Belgium-backed railways had one million people flowing through the city each year, taking the virus to neighbouring regions.Experts said it was a fascinating insight into the start of the pandemic.HIV came to global attention in the 1980s and has infected nearly 75 million people.It has a much longer history in Africa, but where the pandemic started has remained the source of considerable debate.FAMILY AFFAIRA team at the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, tried to reconstruct HIV's ""family tree"" and find out where its oldest ancestors came from.The research group analysed mutations in HIV's genetic code.""You can see the footprints of history in today's genomes, it has left a record, a mutation mark in the HIV genome that can't be eradicated,"" Prof Oliver Pybus from the University of Oxford told the BBC.By reading those mutational marks, the research team rebuilt the family tree and traced its roots.HIV is a mutated version of a chimpanzee virus, known as simian immunodeficiency virus, which probably made the species-jump through contact with infected blood while handling bush meat.The virus made the jump on multiple occasions. One event led to HIV-1 subgroup O which affects tens of thousands in Cameroon.Yet only once, HIV-1 subgroup M, went on to infect millions of people across every country in the world.The answer to why this happened lies in the era of black and white film and the tail-end of the European empires.In the 1920s, Kinshasa (called Leopoldville until 1966) was part of the Belgian Congo.Prof Oliver Pybus said: ""It was a very large and very rapidly growing area and colonial medical records show there was a high incidence of various sexually transmitted diseases.""Sex and railwaysLarge numbers of male labourers were drawn to the city, distorting the gender balance until men outnumbered women two to one, eventually leading to a roaring sex trade.Prof Pybus added: ""There are two aspects of infrastructure that could have helped public health campaigns to treat people for various infectious diseases, with injections seem a plausible route [for spreading the virus].""The second really interesting aspect is the transport networks that enabled people to move round a huge country.""Around one million people were using Kinshasa's railways by the end of the 1940s.The virus spread, with neighbouring Brazzaville and the mining province, Katanga, rapidly hit.Those ""perfect storm"" conditions lasted just a few decades in Kinshasa, but by the time they ended the virus was already starting to spread around the world.Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""It's a fascinating insight into the early phases of the HIV-1 pandemic.""It's the usual suspects that are most likely to have helped the virus get a foothold in humans - travel, population increases and human practices such as unsafe healthcare interventions and prostitution.""Perhaps the most contentious suggestion is that the spread of the M-group viruses had more to do with the conditions being right than it had to do with these viruses being better adapted for transmission and growth in humans. I'm sure this suggestion will prompt interesting and lively debate within the field.""Dr Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said: ""It does seem an interesting study demonstrating very elegantly how HIV spread in the Congo region long before the Aids epidemic was recognised in the early 80s.""It was already known that HIV in humans arose by cross species transmission from chimpanzees in that region of Africa, but this study maps in great detail the spread of the virus from Kinshasa, it was fascinating to read.""    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['used', 'kinshasa', '1920s', 'roots', 'sex', 'team', 'railways', 'pybus', 'university', 'spread', 'traced', 'virus', 'hiv', 'pandemics']","Photo: ReutersThe origin of the Aids pandemic has been traced to the 1920s in the city of Kinshasa, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, scientists say.

An international research team that includes scientists from the German Primate Center (DPZ), Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in Göttingen, has developed a new treatment strategy against the HIV-related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). SI viruses infect different primate species and are regarded as the origin of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In the study, SIV-infected rhesus macaques were treated with an antiretroviral drug for 90 days and in addition they were treated with a specific antibody for 23 weeks. After finishing this therapy, all macaques showed sustained control of the infection as almost no SI viruses could be detected in the blood and gastro-intestinal tissues. The CD4+ T cells that are essential for the immune system were present in sufficient numbers in these tissues.

With some new developments and better understanding of the mysterious virus, the scientists are now desperately hoping for a cure of HIV/AIDS, what they believe is the only way to end epidemic.There are over 20 anti-HIV drugs available worldwide that can restore health, prolong life of the person living with HIV/AIDS and significantly reduce transmission of the virus to those not infected. However, drugs do not eradicate HIV and people are exposed to its potential toxic effects for life. Moreover, the expense to adhere to therapy for indefinite period is enormous specially in resource-poor setting. Developing an effective vaccine is another potential area to end epidemic. But success of this effort is still far away and has not yet shown very promising result.In these contexts, keeping the quest to cure HIV is crucial and the efforts need to be intensified to get a potential solution to end the epidemic and save money and resource for other emerging crisis.A number of recent advancements in proving an effective cure that shed light and renew optimism to peruse cure research. The case of Timothy Brown, the so-called “Berlin Patient”, who received a stem-cell bone-marrow transplant in 2007 and is now considered to be cured of HIV has proved that a cure is at least possible.There is also a rare group of HIV infected people who appear to have naturally cured their own infection are being examined and researched extensively to find a clue for cure.The major challenge to cure is the latent HIV reservoirs — where HIV hides and persists in unreachable location that does not eradicated by drugs. Some recent researches have shown that drugs in combination can unmask latent virus that might allow clearance of infection and boost immune defense. Researches also revealed that benefit of early treatment that can successfully stop the need of drug after a certain period without viral rebound.A group of international experts convened by the International AIDS Society (IAS) have very recently developed a roadmap for research towards an HIV cure. It highlighted the need of more investment in cure research, establishment of large, multinational collaborations involving experts from multiple disciplines (basic and clinical scientists including those outside of the HIV arena), mentoring and supporting young researchers with out of box ideas and strong community support for advocacy.E-mail: rajib.hossain@thedailystar.net    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'need', 'end', 'hiv', 'research', 'virus', 'quest', 'treatment', 'potential', 'cure', 'drugs']","Finding a cure for HIV was a dare dream for decades.

Tainted syringe infects 33 with HIV in Uttar Pradesh,"At least 33 people have tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau town of Uttar Pradesh after an unqualified medical practitioner injected some of them with an infected syringe, a government official says.",,2018-02-07T14:00:18+06:00,"At least 33 people have tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau town of Uttar Pradesh after an unqualified medical practitioner injected some of them with an infected syringe, a government official said.The 33 were confirmed from among 566 people tested at government-organised HIV screening camps on Jan. 24, 25 and 27, according to SP Choudhary, chief medical officer (CMO) of Unnao district, which includes Bangarmau. The camps were set up after several suspected HIV cases showed up during routine tests at the district hospitals in Bangarmau late last year, he added.”We ask HIV patients various things to know the source of infection,“ Choudhary said. ”When we asked these patients whether they had used common syringes, some of them told us about a doctor they went to who uses the same syringe on all his patients.”Arun Pratap Singh, a Bangarmau police official, said an investigative file had been opened against the suspect doctor identified as Rajendra Kumar. Singh said Kumar had gone into hiding and police were searching for him.He said the doctor could be charged with carrying out a negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases, voluntarily causing grievous harm by using dangerous weapons or means, and practising medicine without having registration as a medical practitioner with the state government.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Choudhary said he was not sure how many of the 33 cases were connected to Kumar, but that an investigation by a state government committee was continuing.“Patients have told us this man is about 35 years old and would go around on a bicycle, giving out pills and injections to treat colds, coughs and other ailments. He is a quack,” Choudhary said.A shortage of doctors in India leads many patients to depend on unqualified practitioners, many of whom work out of hole-in-the-wall clinics in rural areas. The Indian Medical Association estimates that about 45 percent of the people in India who practice medicine have no formal training.Critics have in the past blamed a lack of stringent criminal penalties that allow quacks to thrive.Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state run by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has a sketchy healthcare record in a country whose spending on medical care ranks among the lowest in the world as a percentage of GDP.Dozens of deaths from encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh last year led to a firestorm of criticism of the state's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, who took office early last year.The HIV-positive patients were being treated at a government college in Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Choudhary said.","['medical', 'kumar', 'uses', 'uttar', 'patients', 'infected', 'syringe', 'doctor', 'state', 'pradesh', 'quack', '33', 'bangarmau', 'tainted', 'hiv', 'choudhary']","At least 33 people have tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau town of Uttar Pradesh after an unqualified medical practitioner injected some of them with an infected syringe, a government official said.

HIV positive people and stigma,Photo: Nadia Richie,,2010-12-26T00:00:00+06:00,"Photo: Nadia RichieWorld Aids Day 2010 was recently observed. To create awareness, our government also observed the day in collaboration with the NGOs. But do we think really about the situation of the HIV positive persons in our country? They are often discriminated against and stigmatised in different ways. An HIV positive person is considered polygamous, even if he/she is not, in Bangladesh where polygamy is treated negatively by the society. He/she faces hatred, and is often shunned by his/her own friends and family.The cruelty towards the HIV positive people commonly results in no access to the job market, refusal in giving inheritance property, and even refusal by doctors to provide medical treatment. Afraid of being ostracised by the society HIV positive people often do not disclose their problems to anyone, which results in physical and mental suffering.To reduce the stigma and discrimination regarding HIV/Aids we have to speak positively about the sufferers. As citizens of this country it is our responsibility to take part in combating HIV/Aids, and there is a window of opportunity to prevent this pandemic. We must ensure provision of universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010 as our social responsibility.Since the onset of the epidemic, experience has clearly demonstrated that significant advances in the response to HIV have been achieved when there is strong and committed leadership. We should work on reducing the stigma on HIV/Aids. We have to advocate for the rights of those living with and affected by HIV/Aids through sensitisation of groups, communities and society for creating positive, friendly and supportive relationship with families and friends.We also have to support empowerment of the people with HIV so they can take control of their lives. We have to take the private sector on board. Health workers should not refuse to provide treatment to HIV-positive people.In our country the first case of HIV/Aids was detected in 1989. Since then, 2088 cases of HIV/Aids have been confirmed. 37 people died as of December 1, and the total death toll is 241 till date. The estimated total number of people living with HIV/Aids in Bangladesh is around 7,500 as of December 2009.We should acknowledge persons or organisations that have helped support the cause, and continue the good and supporting relationship between the government and NGOs. The main focus should be on sensitising our communities to respect and accept people living with HIV (PLHIV), and on preventing the spread of HIV. We should not be judgmental as to how they got infected. Most of all we should learn to love them, and then the rest will follow.The human rights and stigma situation has improved a bit because nowadays we can talk about sex workers, drug users, clients of sex workers, people living with HIV/Aids and adolescents. Refusal of services to them is prohibited in Bangladesh.Targeted interventions are inadequate because of lack of involvement of media, inadequate monitoring, evaluation and research, lack of proper planning and implementation of HIV and human rights programmes, absence of drug substitution, and lack of general understanding of people living with HIV/Aids. A positive role of civil society in addressing the issues can make a big change in combating HIV.The government should invest in research and documentation. Institutions should use the best practices and share them with the policy level stakeholders. The voice of the HIV positive people should be raised through media campaign. Entry training and in service training should be provided for HIV/Aids in education awareness and media. Political commitment needs to be strengthenedTo remove the stigma on HIV we need to organise talk shows to raise awareness. The programmes should be implemented for the target people or the clients according to the demand. Law enforcing agencies and the community should be involvement. There should be an active human rights watch groups for reducing stigma and discrimination, and legislation for sex work in brothels, streets and hotels until the government can provide them socio economic security. There should be implementation of existing policies.

Battling HIV/AIDS,"WHEN the world first learned about HIV/AIDS in the early eighties there was confusion, stigma and little scientific information.

At first, many thought it was a disease of homosexuals because the first identified cases were from that group. Almost everybody in the regular society thought the new infection posed no direct threat.However, this turned out to be a myth and, like a bush fire, HIV swept across the globe affecting every single country. Doctors and scientists embarked on rigorous studies and researches for discovering a cure, but a horrible truth emerged -- there was no ready cure because the virus continuously changed its physical structure!So if one element controlled or cured one particular strain, it was ineffective on many other varieties of HIV.For the first time since the bubonic plague of the medieval ages, mankind faced another similar situation of the same magnitude and the only way out is though prevention. The public health specialists from all over the world joined hands and initiated preventive measures on both national and international scale.Even then it took decades of concerted efforts to slow down the onslaught of HIV because like the many shifting physical shapes, HIV also has many routes for spreading and some of these routes are less known or considered for interventions.The social and economic burden of HIV epidemic on a nation is devastating and one has just to look at the African countries to get an idea!HIV infection was detected in Bangladesh around the nineties and, to date, the prevalence in the general population is less than one percent -- meaning there is still no general epidemic. This is no reason for complacency on our part for a number of reasons:	The countries surrounding Bangladesh -- India, Mayanmar, China, Thailand -- have either HIV epidemic or very high prevalence; Some Most At Risk Groups (MARG), like Intravenous Drug Users (IDU), in Bangladesh show much higher prevalence at certain sampling points -- the experts call this a ""concentrated epidemic;"" 	The national serological and behavioural surveillance systems are not comprehensive or concurrent, leaving large gaps through which HIV epidemic may enter; National HIV interventions are not consistent or comprehensive -- for example, last year, there was a drop in the HIV interventions by the NGO network, which implements the bulk of community interventions because there was a drop in donor funding. Most of the interventions cover the most accessible and the most popular locations and target groups; The government is not strengthening implementation of existing safety policies regarding needle safety, clinical waste disposal, decontamination and sterilisation of surgical instruments, blood transfusion, special protection acts for women and children, etc.   So, what can we do about HIV prevention in Bangladesh?First of all, we need to pool all available resources and initiate a national policy for coordination and collaboration for HIV interventions. This will immediately improve outcome and reduce wastage of increasingly scarce resources.Secondly, we need to standardise all critical HIV interventions for maximum effect -- for example all messages on condom use, no matter by whom, should say the same thing in exactly the same way.Then we need to prioritise our national HIV interventions so that they will produce maximum effect in minimum possible time. In order to do this we can look at Thailand, which has managed to bring down the HIV infection on a national scale.It is best for us just to copy the two focus areas that the Thailand government acted upon -- consistent condom use and regulations for commercial sex.The other focus areas would include:	Strengthening of STI/RTI case detection and treatment, Strict implementation of existing blood transfusion, and surgical instrument and needle safety regulations, with high penalty for noncompliance, Formulation of national clinical waste disposal standards, Formulation and strict implementation of HIV policies regarding migrating populations and Strict implementation of existing women and child protection laws. The last relates to national HIV scene because, in almost all cases of exploitation or abuse of women and children, there is every possibility for HIV infection. We can use existing women empowerment and adolescent programs in this regard.If we start immediately and in a logically planned manner, we can stop HIV in Bangladesh. Our social, cultural and religious environment has kept us safe so far. Now it is for us to take the initiative and drive back the HIV epidemic from our motherland.Dr. Ishtiaq Shahriar Joarder is a national HIV specialist in the second urban primary health care project.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'interventions', 'epidemic', 'implementation', 'thailand', 'national', 'women', 'existing', 'battling', 'hiv', 'infection']","WHEN the world first learned about HIV/AIDS in the early eighties there was confusion, stigma and little scientific information.

The link between GBV and HIV infections,"WORLD AIDS Day (WAD) celebrated on the first of December every year since 1988 aims to increase awareness of the disease, fight the",,2015-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"WORLD AIDS Day (WAD) celebrated on the first of December every year since 1988 aims to increase awareness of the disease, fight the stigma associated with it, improve HIV education, and mobilize resources for the global response to the epidemic.The commemoration coincides with the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence campaign, no coincidence as the links between GBV and HIV/AIDS are very clear.On a global scale, but also in Bangladesh HIV is increasingly impacting adolescent girls and young women. They are vulnerable owing to violence, child marriage, lack of comprehensive sexuality education, inability to negotiate safe sex, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services – including condoms, HIV/STI testing and counselling, and treatment.Although the HIV prevalence in Bangladesh is low, still under 0.1%, the demographics of Bangladesh present considerable challenges to the HIV prevention program. Bangladesh is a densely populated country, with enduring poverty, low levels of education, gender inequality and high levels of cross border travel. In Asia Pacific between 2005 and 2013, new infections declined by 6%. But in Bangladesh the estimated new infections increased by 25% from 2001 to 2012 and the reported new infections in Bangladesh increased by about 1.5 times over the past 5 years. The estimated number of people living with HIV in Bangladesh is 9500. However only approximately one third of these people have been diagnosed as living with HIV and only 1150 people are enrolled in care. Bangladesh provides free anti-retroviral treatment to all who need it. In order for the treatment opportunities to really have an impact it is however paramount for people to know their HIV status. Bangladesh still has very limited health facilities which offer testing and counselling for HIV. HIV testing and counselling therefore needs to be upgraded and integrated into mixed models of community-based testing, this is possible by linking it to sexual and reproductive health services.About a third of newly diagnosed cases in 2014 affected women and in 10 percent of new cases the diagnosed person was between the ages of 19 and 24. The high number of external and internal migrants and the low level of accurate knowledge, especially young people have about HIV are contributing risk factors in Bangladesh.Addressing restrictive social norms that prevent women and girls from accessing sexual and reproductive health information and services and owning their sexual health is crucial. Concerted efforts are needed to change these gender norms and to make communities safe and supportive for young women and girls.We need to empower adolescent and young people with knowledge; only 13% of females and 23% of males between15 and 24 correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission in Bangladesh. Based on the National Strategic Plan we know that Most At Risk Adolescents (MARA) are one of the key vulnerable populations for getting infected with HIV.Responding to HIV/AIDS also needs to address gender-based violence. Vulnerability to HIV is intertwined with GBV and therefore requires integrated actions. The rate of GBV in Bangladesh is high, as we know from a survey on violence against women from 2011. Actions to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls must also include HIV response. Prevention, screening and access to health, social services and post-exposure prophylaxis as well as diagnosis and treatment need to be part and parcel of health sector response to GBV. We also need to roll back punitive laws and policies that promote stigma and discrimination and disempower people from accessing servicesThe Sustainable Development Goals call on us to leave no one behind. Investment is needed in local data and services to ensure that we reach the most vulnerable. We must invest in the holistic development of adolescents through education, health, employment and psychological well-being. We must ensure people in humanitarian crises, conflict and other emergency situations have access to an effective package of sexual and reproductive health services, including for prevention and treatment of HIV and STIs. We must intensify programming with key populations to reduce their HIV burden and protect the whole community.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  UNFPA continues to support governments and community organizations to strengthen integrated maternal and child health services, as well as community-led responses.

Modern HIV prevention: What’s next for women?,"Recently, some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers gathered in Boston at the Conference on Retroviruses and",,2016-02-28T00:00:00+06:00,"Recently, some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers gathered in Boston at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). “What’s next for women?” was the question on the minds of many, after results were released from two trials that looked at one of the most promising new HIV prevention tools of our time: the long-acting dapivirine vaginal ring, a female-controlled HIV prevention method that could potentially protect women for up to a month at a time.ASPIRE (MTN 020) and The Ring Study (IPM 027) looked at the safety and effectiveness of these women-controlled devices; their results were among the most anticipated data to be released at the conference.The news from CROI was encouraging and potentially far-reaching – trial results found the ring to be effective in preventing HIV infection among women (27% and 31% protection overall among the roughly 4,500 women enrolled in these two studies).This is truly a major advance for the field of HIV prevention, especially for women. It is clear – as was the case with oral PrEP – that we need to move quickly to open-label and demonstration projects to understand the real-world impact of this new intervention.The vaginal ring is one more addition to an already exciting array of antiretroviral-based biomedical options in the prevention toolbox that has ushered in a new era in HIV prevention. For the first time, a real prevention menu is beginning to take shape.Despite immense progress in diagnostics and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, every year roughly two million people worldwide become newly infected with HIV. The situation is particularly grim for women and young girls in sub-Saharan Africa, where women account for more than half of all people living with HIV, and the burden of disease continues to increase among young women. Offering a variety of effective prevention approaches to suit diverse needs for diverse populations at different times in their lives is the key to controlling the epidemic, at least until there is a vaccine and a cure.Interventions that address gender-based violence and the socioeconomic needs of young women must also be part of this comprehensive response. Our focus needs to remain inclusive, involving community mobilization and leadership at all levels. It must also be broad, encompassing the biomedical, behavioural, and structural components of combination prevention while respecting, protecting, and promoting sexual reproductive health and rights.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  There is still much more to be done. There is an urgent need to deploy the tools in the right way to the right people. At the same time, we must continue to explore new innovations that will improve and further expand the menu of prevention options for women. The exciting results from ASPIRE and The Ring Study bring new hope in this area.","['prevention', 'vaginal', 'modern', 'women', 'ring', 'whats', 'study', 'results', 'needs', 'hiv', 'tools', 'young']","“What’s next for women?” was the question on the minds of many, after results were released from two trials that looked at one of the most promising new HIV prevention tools of our time: the long-acting dapivirine vaginal ring, a female-controlled HIV prevention method that could potentially protect women for up to a month at a time.
This is truly a major advance for the field of HIV prevention, especially for women.
The vaginal ring is one more addition to an already exciting array of antiretroviral-based biomedical options in the prevention toolbox that has ushered in a new era in HIV prevention.

New approach against HIV ‘promising’,The first human trial of a new type of HIV therapy suggests it could be a promising weapon in the fight against the virus.,,2015-04-09T12:13:00+06:00,"The first human trial of a new type of HIV therapy suggests it could be a promising weapon in the fight against the virus.Reports in the journal Nature show infusions of so-called broadly neutralising antibodies could suppress the amount of HIV in a patient's blood.The approach uses clones of immune proteins taken from a rare individual who has natural control of the disease.Scientists hope with further work this could bolster current treatments.'Profound effects' People naturally mount a defence against the virus by producing an army of protein based weapons - antibodies. But in most cases these are not powerful enough to defeat it.The international research team harvested copies of unusually potent ones, capable of neutralising many different strains of HIV.Patients given the highest concentrations were able to fight the virus for some time, dampening the replication of HIV in their blood.The strength of this protection varied - in some it lasted more than four weeks.In the journal the authors said: ""Our data establish that passive infusion of single broadly neutralising antibodies can have profound effects on HIV viraemia in humans.""But because of the virus's ability to mutate rapidly, in some patients it was able to outwit the therapy by changing structure over time.To overcome this scientists suggest using this treatment alongside current drugs or together with other antibodies.'Immune jolt'Prof Michel Nussenzweig of the Rockefeller University in New York, told BBC News: ""This is different to treatment out there already on two counts.""First because it comes from a human - so it is natural in that respect.""And secondly it opens up the possibility of giving the patient's own weakened immune system a jolt.""One part of the antibody could act as a red flag - pointing out to the body where the virus is hiding and sending signals to kill it.""They are now exploring whether the infusion could shield people from getting the disease in the first place.But he cautioned that studies into the antibody are still small and at an early stage.""We have shown the approach is safe and effective.""What this trial is telling us is that it is now time to look at the possibilities - from prevention and treatment to even cure,"" he said.Commenting on the findings, Prof Vincent Piguet from Cardiff University, said: ""This exciting novel study shows for the first time that antibodies may have a place in the line of therapies directed against HIV.""He described it as an ""important development in the fight against HIV"" but said the costs of antibody therapy and the emergence of resistance must be taken into account.","['promising', 'neutralising', 'patients', 'antibodies', 'therapy', 'approach', 'antibody', 'university', 'virus', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'fight']","The first human trial of a new type of HIV therapy suggests it could be a promising weapon in the fight against the virus.

Tie HIV programmes to health services,"Speakers at a roundtable yesterday called for stronger linkage between sexual and reproductive health services and HIV programmes in the country to contain HIV and enhance the range of treatment, care and support. They said the significant cause of HIV infection is directly related to risky sexual behaviours, pregnancy, childbirth and lack of information.",,2009-10-28T23:00:00+07:00,"Speakers at a roundtable yesterday called for stronger linkage between sexual and reproductive health services and HIV programmes in the country to contain HIV and enhance the range of treatment, care and support.They said the significant cause of HIV infection is directly related to risky sexual behaviours, pregnancy, childbirth and lack of information.Considering limited resources in the country, planning, integration of existing settings and interventions with a common approach can meet broader health and social needs of people instead of providing services separately, the speakers pointed out.The roundtable on 'Linkage of Sexual and Reproductive Health in Prevention of HIV in Bangladesh' was jointly organised by The Daily Star and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) at The Daily Star conference room in the capital.Khandaker Ezazul Haque, HIV officer of UNFPA, presented the keynote paper.He explained that lack of linkage means low coverage of services, poor access to information and commodity, higher rate of unsafe sexual and risk taking behaviours, frequent sexually transmitted infection and poor uptake of voluntary counselling and screening centres.He pointed out that existing social stigma about HIV, lack of male partner participation, lack of information pose major challenges in addressing HIV related issues.Since the beginning of the pandemic, AIDS has claimed more than 28 million lives worldwide. Around 42 million are now living with HIV and AIDS. In 2008, about 2.5 million new HIV infected were detected while 2.1 million died of it the same year.The first HIV case in Bangladesh was detected in 1989. Since then, about 1,495 cases were detected among which 476 people developed AIDS. So far the deadly syndrome claimed about 165 lives in the country.Although the number is still low, Bangladesh must not wait until it becomes prevalent in the country, the speakers emphasised.The speakers also pointed out that the youth are the most vulnerable. Lack of information or misinformation increases their vulnerability. Topics on HIV and related issues should be incorporated in the academic curricula, they added.Salil Panakadan, country coordinator of UNAIDS, pointed out that in the policy level linkage between sexual and reproductive health services and HIV programmes are gradually becoming a necessity in addressing HIV. However, integration in terms of services is posing a big challenge.Arthur Erken, UNFPA Representative to Bangladesh, summarised the roundtable and said the Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centres (VCT) should play a vital role in containing HIV instead of just screening for the virus.He also placed emphasis on a comprehensive national strategic plan that should be formulated by the National AIDS and STD Programme (NASP). Long-term goals should be determined for education system and in addressing risky male sexual behaviour, he said.He added that the government should think about the sexual behaviour of the youth and incorporate the topic in formal education, as ignorance makes them most vulnerable.The Daily Star Editor Mahfuz Anam said one of the basic problems is that we suffer from an idea that we are lucky since the rate of HIV infection in Bangladesh is still low.HIV related issues require dealing with a very private human behaviour, which is not discussed in public in Bangladesh. This poses a difficulty but we have to understand that HIV is as serious as life and death, he added.Shale Ahmed of Bandhu Social Welfare Society stressed inter-ministerial coordination among different ministries concerned, including health, education and home affairs, to prevent HIV.Tanvir Hasan of Brac University urged to stop discriminatory behaviour with the people living with HIV (PLHIV). He referred to a survey, which stated that even the health service providers treat PLHIV badly.Shamsul Haque Gazi, deputy programme manager, NASP, DGHS, Bridget Job Johnson, HIV specialist for Unicef, Farhana Haque, lecturer of Public Health, Independent University, Samir K Howlader, national programme officer, International Organisation for Migration, Kalpana Rani, project coordinator, Care Bangladesh, spoke at the roundtable among others.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['related', 'bangladesh', 'tie', 'roundtable', 'programmes', 'speakers', 'health', 'sexual', 'services', 'lack', 'hiv', 'pointed']","Speakers at a roundtable yesterday called for stronger linkage between sexual and reproductive health services and HIV programmes in the country to contain HIV and enhance the range of treatment, care and support.

The film is an initiative to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS and the screening was sponsored by UNAIDS in collaboration with Grameenphone.UNAIDS' mission is to lead, strengthen and support an extended response to HIV and AIDS that includes preventing transmission of HIV, providing care and support to those already living with the virus, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV and alleviating the impact of the epidemic.The tele-film is directed by Tony Michael, and is his first work. Intekhab Dinar, Richi Solaiman and Tazin Ahmed have played the central roles.The film follows Anis (Intekhab Dinar) who donates blood for his friend but the doctors refrain from injecting the blood to the patient as HIV is detected in Anis' blood. To reconfirm Anis goes to a doctor (Tazin Ahmed) and gets another blood test. When his wife, Mili (Richi), finds out that Anis is HIV positive, she leave him, thinking that he must have cheated on her by having illicit relationships with other women. This devastates Anis, as now he has no one to provide moral support. He tries to trace the source of the disease but fails. At one point he recalls that while he was a student of university, someone once gave him blood to save his life. Anis is convinced that the donor must have been HIV positive. Meanwhile Mili is also tested HIV positive. In the end the two decide to support each other.The film tries to generate awareness on transmission of HIV through unsafe blood transfusion. The film also focuses on the importance of the support and care an individual living with HIV/AIDS needs.Talking about the film, Tony says, “Documentaries, films and TV plays can play a major role in generating awareness and that has been the key message in my film.” “With no known cure yet, 'awareness' is the only effective means to fight HIV/AIDS,” he adds.AIDS or 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

She responded to diagnostic tests for HIV-1 but further tests failed to pinpoint the viral subtype.The virus was genetically decoded and then put through a computer model to compare its evolutionary past against known viruses, both HIV and its equivalent in apes, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).The strain was a ""significant"" match with SIVgor -- an immune deficiency virus found in gorillas.""The most likely explanation for its emergence is gorilla-to-human transmission of SIVgor,"" the letter says.The research was headed by Jean-Christophe Plantier at a national referencing laboratory for HIV at the Rouen Hospital Centre, northwestern France.HIV is believed to have jumped from humans from their closest animal relatives more than a century ago, in west-central Africa.Analysis of tissues preserved by doctors in the colonial-era Belgian Congo shows that HIV-1 began spreading among humans at some point between 1884 and 1924, according to an investigation published last October.But until now, the known vector has been the chimpanzee.Some experts have suspected that the gorilla may have been implicated in the N subtype, but this is the first time that a link has been so clearly defined.""A gorilla origin is highly likely"" in the new P subtype, Marie Leoz, one of the research team, told AFP.""For the time being, it's the closest source. What is still quite difficult, though, is to date when the first transmission of the virus took place, because there are still very few gorilla strains that are available.""Leoz also said subtype P was probably rare among humans, but further work was needed to confirm this.The Cameroonian woman has no sign of AIDS, is receiving treatment and has a stable count of viruses and of CD4 cells, a key benchmark of immune-system fitness, said Leoz.There are several theories that seek to explain how SIV entered humans.An infected animal bit a human, or a SIV-infected ape was butchered and sold for bushmeat, and the virus entered the bloodstream through tiny cuts in the hand, according to these hypotheses.AIDS first came to public notice in 1981, when alert US doctors noted an unusual cluster of deaths among young homosexuals in California and New York.It has since killed at least 25 million people, and 33 million others are living with the disease or HIV, the virus that destroys immune cells and exposes the body to opportunistic disease.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['p', 'gorilla', 'leapt', 'viruses', 'humans', 'woman', 'hiv1', 'gorillas', 'according', 'virus', 'strain', 'hiv', 'subtype']","French virologists yesterday said they had found a new subtype of the AIDS virus that appears to have jumped the species barrier to humans from gorillas.

But the virus mutates and evades the offensive, so the body produces new antibodies that the virus then evades and the war goes on.However, after about four years of this struggle some patients hit on to a winner by targeting something the virus finds harder to change - an Achilles heel.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  ""Even though the virus mutates and there are literally millions of quasi-species of virus because of all these mutations, but there are parts the virus can't change otherwise the virus cannot infect - these are the vulnerable sites,"" Prof Barton Haynes, of Duke University, in North Carolina, told the BBC.At this stage of the infection it is far too late to make a difference for the patient as the virus is hiding in untouchable reservoirs.However, some researchers believe that vaccines that encourage the body to produce these ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" may give people immunity to the virus.Super antibodyThe research team's study is based on a patient in Africa who had a rapid diagnosis, about four weeks after being infected with the virus.They were eventually able to produce an antibody named CH103 that could neutralise 55% of HIV samples.It was not produced in one easy step. Rather it was the product of the war of the immune system and HIV trying to out-evolve each other.However, through regular genetic analyses of both the immune system and virus, researchers could piece together each of the steps that culminated in the production of CH103.It is like a training manual for the immune system.Prof Haynes said: ""What we were able to do was map out the arms race of both virus and antibody, and in doing so we have now a map.""This is the first time we've been able to see the actual road map.""He said the challenge now was to see if re-creating those steps could lead to a viable vaccine.However, he said it would almost certainly need to be a vaccine combining multiple ""Achilles heels"" - in the same way that HIV therapies are a combination of drug treatments.Prof Jane Anderson, consultant at Homerton hospital in London and chair of the British HIV Association, said: ""The study gives important insights into the ways in which the human immune system responds to HIV infection and increases our understanding about the relationships between the virus and the human host.""This is another welcome step on the path to develop vaccines against HIV.""Dr Sarah Joseph, who tests HIV vaccines at the Medical Research Council clinical trials unit, said: ""This paper is really interesting.

The patients were caught early as they turned up in hospital with other conditions and HIV was found in their blood.They stuck to a course of antiretroviral drugs for three years, on average, but then stopped.The drugs keep the virus only in check, they cannot eradicate it from its hiding places inside the immune system.Normally, when the drugs stop, the virus bounces back.This has not happened in the Visconti patients. Some have been able to control HIV levels for a decade.Dr Asier Saez-Cirion, from the Institute Pasteur in Paris, said: ""Most individuals who follow the same treatment will not control the infection, but there are a few of them who will.""He said 5-15 percent of patients may be functionally cured, meaning they no longer needed drugs, by attacking the virus soon after infection.""They still have HIV, it is not eradication of HIV, it is a kind of remission of the infection.""Their latest study, in the journal PLoS Pathogens, analysed what happened to the immune system of the patients.Early treatment may limit the number of unassailable HIV hideouts that are formed. However, the researchers said it was ""unclear"" why only some patients were functionally cured.Dr Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University School of Medicine, said the findings were ""certainly interesting"".""The presumption is that they've started treatment very early and the virus hasn't spread to so many of the long-term reservoirs and that's why it works.""Whether they'll control it forever, or whether it'll be for a number of years and subsequently they will progress and the virus will reappear, we don't know.""However, he cautioned that many patients would be diagnosed much later than in this study.Deborah Jack, the chief executive of the National AIDS Trust said it was ""exciting times"" in progress towards an HIV cure, but the key was early treatment.""This just underlines the importance of people being testing and diagnosed early.

Of these, 57,000 require treatment but only 30,000 were receiving it as of the end of 2008, according to Unicef.Researchers at TREAT Asia found children as young as five were developing resistance to AIDS drugs and may soon require improved, more expensive medicines, which are not available for them yet.Poor adherence to the timing or frequency of taking AIDS drugs can result in resistance. But in Asia, resistance is also due to the lack of drug formulations for children.Annette Sohn, Director of TREAT Asia said health experts and drug providers need to find ways to make third-line, more powerful drugs available for children in poor countries. Such medications are available or subsidised in rich nations but very expensive and sometimes unavailable in developing countries.""We all made some mistakes on how we managed patients with HIV in the beginning of the epidemic,"" Sohn said.

This competition offers a unique opportunity to channel small grants directly to community organisations and NGOs to implement imaginative approaches that will help change the attitudes and practices that undermine effective programmes,” he added.In South Asia, anecdotal evidence and research are demonstrating the extent of the role of stigma in hampering prevention, treatment and care of HIV and AIDS.For instance, a study in India found that 34 percent of students, faculty, and technical staff of the public health services would not associate with people living with HIV and AIDS.The HIV epidemic in South Asia is mainly driven by high-risk practices such as sex work, injecting drug use and unprotected sex between men.""Many of the people most at risk for HIV around the world deal with stigma on a regular basis, posing challenges to achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support,"" said UNAIDS Executive Director Dr Peter Piot.""It is encouraging to see innovative steps being taken towards addressing these issues in South Asia, where stigma and discrimination remain serious problems,"" he said.The South Asia Regional Development Marketplace is implemented in partnership with UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNODC, UNDP, GFATM and with the private sector and it is open to all 'civil society groups, social entrepreneurs, youth organisations, private foundations, academia, and private sector corporations' with unique ideas that may not attract funding from traditional sources of finance.The maximum award will be US$40,000 per proposal.Proposals will be accepted until January 21, 2008.The Development Marketplace is a WB programme that uses a competitive and transparent process to support grassroots initiatives with innovative approaches to solve challenging development issues.The programme has awarded nearly $34 million to roughly 800 small-scale projects over the last seven years.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['ideas', 'seeks', 'development', 'private', 'stigma', 'marketplace', 'discrimination', 'aids', 'south', 'wb', 'asia', 'hiv', 'fight']","The winners will be selected by an international jury of WB and independent HIV and AIDS experts at the Development Marketplace event in Mumbai, India on May 15, 2008.

Nutrition for HIV infection and AIDS,"Do we eat to live"" or ""live to eat""? The first statement is true for all of us and the second is also true sometimes when our enjoyment of food is more important to us than the sustenance. This is the case for normal humans being like us, but it is different for Persons Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Nutritional care is just as important as medical care for people with HIV infections. Nutritional care and medical care are interdependent, and if we ignore either of these the other will surely suffer. The infection itself disrupts the body's capacity to make use of nutrition.",,2011-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Do we eat to live"" or ""live to eat""? The first statement is true for all of us and the second is also true sometimes when our enjoyment of food is more important to us than the sustenance. This is the case for normal humans being like us, but it is different for Persons Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Nutritional care is just as important as medical care for people with HIV infections. Nutritional care and medical care are interdependent, and if we ignore either of these the other will surely suffer. The infection itself disrupts the body's capacity to make use of nutrition. The HIV virus most often causes three nutritional problems:* Diminished appetite;* Less efficient nutrient absorption; and* Changes in the metabolic way of utilising food.All of these lead to malnutrition, which is a major problem for PLWHA. The most severe symptom of malnutrition in people with HIV infection is weight loss, and it is essentially related to macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein and, fat) deficiencies, not micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) deficiencies. Macronutrients give us calories while micronutrients do not. So, PLWHA should manage their diet so that it meets their macronutrient needs and spend less time on how to meet their micronutrient needs. This should be the most important principle for PLWHA.General nutritional information is okay for most normal people but not appropriate for people with HIV infection. True to say, very few foods are bad for PLWHA. Sugar is alright and salt can be taken. Red meat, saturated fats, and dairy products are fine, and the infected person should be encouraged to consume these things in their daily diet. But one vital thing should be kept in mind, they should avoid foods that could be a contamination risk, especially raw fish, raw meat, raw eggs, unprocessed honey and foods that are more than two days old. Low-fat and low-cholesterol diet is not suitable for PLWHA.Based on positive nutrition pyramid experts suggest eating the foods listed below every day:* Consume twice the normal amount of conventional high class protein (meat, poultry, and fish) daily. This could be 100-120 grams for men, 80-100 grams for women. About 450 grams of meat, poultry, or fish contain about 110 grams of protein;* At least 2 servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables;* At least 2 servings of milk (2 glasses); and* Enough calories from carbohydrate and fat to keep the weight of the PLWHA stable.By following the positive nutrition pyramid, PLWHA receive the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). It is recommended that HIV infected persons should take multivitamin supplements, which provide the vitamins and minerals missing in the diet. Their diet should also contain a safe and recommended amount of trace elements like manganese, copper, chromium, and selenium. The following additional supplements are also recommended for the PLWHA: Vitamin C (500-1000mg), Vitamin E (10-40 IU) and beta carotene (6 mg). Overdosing of other nutrients is not necessary and may be harmful.Sometimes the medical issues take primacy over the nutrition-related aspects of health. This is wrong. Food and medicine should go hand in hand for the treatment of the HIV infected people.

"Lack of transparency, accountability obstacle to fighting HIV/AIDS","Experts at a seminar yesterday said it becomes a challenge to bring transparency and accountability in the institutions working with HIV/AIDS in the country as little progress is seen in last few years. Though Bangladesh received $60 million from Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) for 2004-2012 to combat the disease and already $41 million has been spent, the progress is very insignificant, they said.

In Bangladesh, the rate of HIV prevalence among the injective drug users (IDUs) is more than 10 percent, which is a matter of great concern, she added.The experts said even the media campaign is also vague and lacks information regarding AIDS.Criticising the advertise titled 'Banchte hole jante hobe', they said the advertise does not give messages to common people on what should be known, how and where to get the information and what would be the measures regarding AIDS.The 2008 UNGASS Country Progress Report that is prepared to present in the UN General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS from June 10-11 is a very weak report and shows sluggish advancement in spite of receiving enough fund, they added.“The government did not prepare the report. Rather it was prepared by a foreign consultant by spending a huge amount of money,” said Prof Nazrul Islam of Department of Virology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.Criticising the Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCM), the speakers said in Bangladesh CCM is heavily dominated by government officials and also lacks monitoring and evaluation systems.They recommended the government to improve participation of civil society and a transparent system to select the CCM members.The recommendations include minutes to be provided to all CCM members, sub-groups to plan and establish transparent monitoring systems and distinct roles to avoid conflict of interests and mechanisms to reflect Global Fund's participation principles.APACHA Bangladesh chapter General Secretary Sakiul Millat Morshed and members Kamal Hossain and Tony Michael Gomes also spoke.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'report', 'ccm', 'aids', 'seminar', 'obstacle', 'fund', 'progress', 'transparency', 'country', 'received', 'lack', 'fighting', 'accountability', 'global']","Experts at a seminar yesterday said it becomes a challenge to bring transparency and accountability in the institutions working with HIV/AIDS in the country as little progress is seen in last few years.

HIV/AIDS and financial commitment: Thought of World AIDS Day,"Around 40 million people worldwide are HIV positive, 95% of them live in developing countries. In 2004, approximately five million people were newly infected with the virus. HIV/AIDS has killed more than 20 million people worldwide. 3.1 million people died of AIDS-related causes in 2004. The Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) was created in 2001 to provide major financial resources in the fight against three diseases. These diseases kill over 6 million people each year and the numbers are growing.",,2008-11-29T00:00:00+06:00,"Around 40 million people worldwide are HIV positive, 95% of them live in developing countries.In 2004, approximately five million people were newly infected with the virus. HIV/AIDS has killed more than 20 million people worldwide. 3.1 million people died of AIDS-related causes in 2004.The Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) was created in 2001 to provide major financial resources in the fight against three diseases. These diseases kill over 6 million people each year and the numbers are growing.As of mid-2007, the Global Fund Board approved more than US$ 7.7 billion for programmes in 136 countries. Together with the efforts of many implementing partners, Global Fund-supported programmes have already saved 1.8 million lives. Till mid 2008, the Global Fund committed US$ 11.3 billion in 136 countries to support aggressive interventions against all three diseases.The Global Fund announced its approval of nearly $3 billion in Round 8 funding to improve access to HIV treatment and prevention and help reduce deaths from TB and malaria by 50% by 2015. The Global Fund's board approved 94 grants worth $2.75 billion over two years, representing the group's largest funding round to date (Global Fund release, 11/10).The decision was made in New Delhi, during the Global Fund Board Meeting. The Board decision was rendered particularly difficult because the unusually large average size of the proposals meant that there was not enough money to pay the full cost of the proposals recommended for approval by the Technical Review Panel (TRP).As of mid 2008, Global Fund supported programmes are estimated to have averted more than 2.5 million deaths by providing AIDS treatment (ARV) for 1.75 million people, anti-tuberculosis treatment (DOTS) for 3.9 million people, and by distributing 59 million insecticide-treated bed nets for the prevention of malaria worldwide.Round 8 funding support now brings the Global Fund’s overall portfolio to US$ 14.4 billion in 140 countries. “This is the highest amount of new financing approved by the Global Fund ever. These new resources will significantly help the world in achieving global targets such as universal access to AIDS treatment and prevention, and cutting the number of deaths from tuberculosis and malaria by half by 2015,” said Rajat Gupta, Chair of the Global Fund Board.He added that 38% of the resources will be used for HIV/AIDS programmes, 11% for TB programmes and 51% for malaria programmes. Around 90% of the approved grants will be distributed to low-income countries, 77% of which are in Africa and the Middle East. The remaining funds will be dispersed to countries in Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Pacific, the Caribbean and Latin America.Michel Kazatchkine, Executive Director of the Global Fund, said the ""increased demand"" for funding ""requires a renewed resource mobilisation effort."" He added that the Global Fund has a ""fantastic message to bring back to the rich nations of the world: programmes to fight these three diseases save lives, reduce disease burdens and strengthen health systems"" (Global Fund release, 11/10).There is abundant evidence that science-based HIV prevention is effective, especially when backed by high-level political leadership, a national AIDS programme, strong community involvement together with adequate funding. Components of successful prevention efforts include clear and accurate communication about HIV/AIDS and methods to prevent infection, HIV counselling and testing, and treatment.Gap analysis reveals that vast majority of people living with HIV/AIDS in the developing world do not have access to the treatment, as a result of limited health care infrastructures and the high cost of many medications. It has been estimated that a total of US$7-10 billion a year is needed from all sources to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in low and middle-income countries.

“Megher Koley Rode” Generating awareness on HIV/AIDS,"Clockwise (from top-left) Poppy, Tony Dias and Riaz in Megher Koley Rode",,2008-08-13T00:00:00+06:00,"Clockwise (from top-left) Poppy, Tony Dias and Riaz in Megher Koley RodeIn her latest film, Megher Koley Rode, director Nargis Akter has followed the ""formula"" of ""mainstream cinema"" and has dealt with a contemporary global issue. Done in conventional ""Dhaliwood style"", the film features dances, playbacks and fights in a decent manner, and addresses the wrong perceptions of HIV/AIDS. For the most part, the cast and crew of the film includes are also from the mainstream movie industry.Megher Koley Rode is full of drama and action. USP of the film is proportionate acting  by mainstream actors such as Riaz, Poppy, Ahmed Sharif, Diti and Kabori. Even the debutant Tony Dias performed well. Director Nargis Akter deserves plaudits for managing her actors to perform realistically.Nargis Akter's story and screenplay, especially the dialogue diction, have been aptly done. Two Bangladeshi students -- Rodela (Poppy) and Nijhum (Tony Dias) -- studying at a Malaysian University face a problem regarding accommodation, as the Malaysians deny to rent apartments/ houses to an unmarried couple.Dramatically they meet a Bangladeshi expatriate (Diti), who is a psychiatrist by profession. She solves the problem. A triangular love story is introduced when Uday (Riaz), after completing his Bar at Law degree from UK, comes to meet his best friend Nijhum in Malaysia.Riaz in the character of a flirtatious, fun loving, young chap has performed spontaneously throughout the cinema.Poppy's performance in the multidimensional character of Rodela is worth mentioning. Perhaps the audience has never seen Poppy perform with such conviction, though she is a popular film actor and has won national awards in acting. Her portrayal of aesthetic sentiments as per the requirements of actions deserves plaudit.Tony Dias also performed well in the role of an unsure, insecure individual who always goes by his parents' decisions and cannot even express his love for Rodela.Realising Nijhum's deep love for Rodela, Uday decides to go back to London, though this is for the first time he has been in true love.The triangular love story has been visualised in the intriguing locations of Malaysia.A new drama begins when Nijhum and Rodela decide to go back to Bangladesh and marry. On the wedding night when the bride is waiting for the groom, he does not come suspecting Rodela is HIV positive, as his relative seeing the picture of Rodela's parents identifies them as aids victims who died when Rodela was born.Nijhum's parents create pressure on their son to divorce Rodela on the following day of their wedding. The incident leads the cinema to a lengthy court scene, which sometimes appeared monotonous.For a change Ahmed Sharif, who usually plays negative characters in mainstream films, is seen delivering a credible performance. As per the formula, Uday comes from London to defend Rodela.Playing a gynaecologist, seasoned actor Kabori proves to the court that Rodela is not a HIV positive. If the mother is properly treated under the supervision of an expert doctor, a newborn does not necessarily carry the virus.However, the film has a few flaws. Actions are not properly portrayed in many scenes such as the scene featuring Khurshiduzzaman Utpal (playing Riaz's maternal uncle in the film), meets his ex-fiancé Diti after 12 years.Megher Koley Rode is running for the second consecutive week at Star Cineplex.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['koley', 'performed', 'hivaids', 'poppy', 'rode', 'film', 'generating', 'megher', 'rodela', 'love', 'awareness', 'parents', 'uday', 'mainstream', 'nijhum']","In her latest film, Megher Koley Rode, director Nargis Akter has followed the ""formula"" of ""mainstream cinema"" and has dealt with a contemporary global issue.

Research found breakthrough treatment of HIV/AIDS,,,2010-02-13T00:00:00+06:00,"Since the detection of HIV virus in 1983, scientists and researchers are trying hard to invent and explore effective weapons to fight with the deadly disease. AIDS takes away millions of lives as there is no specific treatment for cure or vaccine to prevent transmission of HIV. In quest to combat HIV/AIDS, a recent research has revealed breakthrough findings to protect body from infection.The research team headed by Mojgan Naghavi, at University college, Dublin in Ireland have found that neurons (brain cells) can protect themselves against infections from HIV. A protein molecule named FEZ-1 uniquely made by neurons plays the key role. The protein appears to lock out the HIV virus. They are pining their hope to produce treatments to thwart HIV by using gene therapy or drugs to activate production of FEZ-1 in cells other than neurons, especially the white blood cells most vulnerable to infection by the virus.Naghavi and her colleagues established the protective effects of FEZ-1 by blocking the gene that makes it in human neurons. This made the neurons vulnerable to infection. Likewise, the team blocked infection that would normally occurs in other types of brain cells, such as microglia, by genetically engineering them to produce FEZ-1. They are now hoping to achieve the same thing in macrophages, a type of white blood cell.The article is compiled by Md Jakir Hossain, a student of Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology at University of Chittagong.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'breakthrough', 'team', 'fez1', 'vulnerable', 'university', 'research', 'white', 'virus', 'treatment', 'cells', 'neurons', 'hiv', 'infection']","Since the detection of HIV virus in 1983, scientists and researchers are trying hard to invent and explore effective weapons to fight with the deadly disease.

HIV/AIDS: No longer a death sentence?,"Scientific breakthroughs have helped us chart an impressive course to the HIV/AIDS response such that in the fourth decade of the epidemic, we are already talking of ending AIDS. A death sentence at the outset, HIV is now a chronic disease.",,2013-12-01T00:00:50+06:00,"Scientific breakthroughs have helped us chart an impressive course to the HIV/AIDS response such that in the fourth decade of the epidemic, we are already talking of ending AIDS. A death sentence at the outset, HIV is now a chronic disease. It is unique in the sense that vaccine for this communicable disease still eludes us and cure is yet not possible. Despite this, we have been able to not only control but have also managed to reverse the epidemic in large parts of the globe.For us to reach this stage, contributions have come from a wide variety of stakeholders -- national governments who have provided the leadership; funding agencies that spearheaded the response and needed research; development agencies including the UN that collaborated and joined forces to support countries in addressing the epidemic and last but not the least communities who continue to relentlessly fight for the right to affordable and equitable access to treatment and without whom we would not be where we are today.Moving ahead, we need to ensure that the bio-medical response addresses both prevention and treatment. The division is now more blurred than ever with the scientific advances that have firmly positioned treatment as prevention. Starting treatment early not only improves quality and longevity for the infected individual but also prevents further transmission to partners.With effective HIV control, we have been able to reduce the number of direct HIV related deaths and adverse outcomes. As people continue to live longer on antiretroviral treatment, not only do they face the common problems of aging like non-HIV population, they are at heightened risk of non-AIDS conditions such as heart disease due to persistent inflammation. These conditions, so far mostly studied in the US and Europe are now becoming important in the developing world. These additional co-morbidities and the shift of HIV care to chronic disease management could overburden already stretched health care systems.These could be addressed if we were to find a potent vaccine to prevent HIV and cure for HIV once infected. A number of cases, including the so-called “Berlin patient” the “Mississippi baby”, and the “Visconti” cohort, have given us hope and impetus in our search for HIV cure. Our quest for a vaccine continues. However, realistically speaking, a scalable cure or a vaccine is not foreseen in the near future. Until then, we must continue and enhance our efforts to ensure that health systems are prepared to safely and effectively deliver long-term chronic HIV and related care.We must not forget that bio-medical interventions alone will not take us to the finish line. In order to achieve an AIDS free world, we need to blend the bio-medical and social-behavioural interventions that ensure universal access to prevention and care of HIV in a health and social system that respects human rights, sexual diversity and gender equity.The writer is the Regional Director-Elect of WHO South East Asia Region.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'death', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'epidemic', 'sentence', 'response', 'ensure', 'health', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'longer', 'hiv', 'cure']","A death sentence at the outset, HIV is now a chronic disease.

Impacts of AIDS on social capital,Photo: Mark Weber,,2010-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Photo: Mark WeberAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Aids) Day is observed on December 1. It is time for us to ponder over our present situation and the link between Aids and development because it has the potential to debilitate and even thwart the process of development itself. Aids is caused by deficiency of the immune system, which stems from infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This pandemic has the potential of affecting our society in a very adverse way, as determinants of HIV are highly prevalent in our society, which portends an ominous future for us.Bangladesh still has a relatively low level of HIV affected people in the most-at-risk population groups, with the exception of injecting drug users (IDU) where prevalence is on a rising trend. According to an estimate by UNAIDS about 12,000 Bangladeshis were infected with HIV at the end of 2007. Although overall HIV prevalence remains under 0.1% among the general population in Bangladesh, there are risk factors that could fuel the spread of HIV among high-risk groups.The HIV/Aids epidemic has an insidious effect on the economic and social welfare of any country. This is especially true for those weak economies that are generally characteristics of countries with high HIV prevalence. This is where we can draw comfort, as it seems that Bangladesh with a low prevalence should not worry about it. But a closer inspection may reveal otherwise.If we consider the determinants and one of the most affected groups only, we may get an indication of an alarming future for us. First, we will consider the spread of Aids through sexual transmission among migrant workers. Bangladesh's economy is mainly consumption-based and is seeing a healthy growth in remittance thanks to the back-breaking toil of our migrant brothers and sisters. A good number among them stay in the foreign countries for most part of their life. The concentration of male migrant workers increases the demand for commercial sex and helps in facilitating the spread of HIV (Hunt, 1989). As more and more people are going abroad every year, the threat is only compounding.In most cases, these migrants are the only bread earners of their families, and studies show that if the infected person is the breadwinner the family suffers financially due to the loss of earnings and increased expenditure for medical care (United Nations, 2004). During the period of illness and after the death of the victim, lack of income and the cost of care can force households to spend their savings, sell their productive assets and borrow money. This causes many Aids affected households to make a rapid transition into poverty. Reduced levels of consumption in Aids-affected households, including reduced food consumption, may also result in malnutrition (United Nations, 2004).Our migrant labour force faces the danger of contracting Aids because of various reasons, ranging from sexual transmission, exposure to blood, to gender inequities, mobility etc. This could put our country in jeopardy and GDP could be reduced due to the deaths of these active people because of Aids.The loss of social capital or the long-term adverse effect on human capital is not taken into account when the impacts of Aids are estimated. The effects of lowered investment in the human capital of younger generations will affect economic performance in the future.Aids normally affects those who have the fewest economic and social resources. It deepens poverty and increases the number of the poor at risk of infection, because those with the fewest resources have the least access to health-care services or health-related information. When we talk about the effect of HIV/Aids epidemic on development, we normally consider material advancement or achievement only. But development is a holistic concept covering social advancement also. A nation's attainment of a long and healthy life for its population is one of the main defining features of successful development. The effect of the epidemic on mortality itself represents a loss of welfare and a loss of GDP (Jamison, Sachs and Wang, 2001).Along with its effects on GDP, HIV/Aids is likely to increase income inequality and poverty. It changes and impoverishes households and weakens inter-generational support systems. If HIV becomes highly prevalent in rural areas, it will cause a reduction in agricultural production, which will lead to food insecurity. Its deadly effect just does not end there as it also strains health-care resources; erodes educational progress and, with diminished labour force, can increase costs for businesses. HIV/Aids reduces investment in human capital and has profound and long-lasting effects on a country's social and economic development.HIV/Aids represents a significant barrier to development on a number of dimensions. The implications of the disease in terms of productivity, human capital and savings imply a manifold detrimental effect for any society. As a developing country, low prevalence of HIV in Bangladesh just might be the tip of an iceberg. So it is high time we took appropriate measures for stopping this epidemic and for cautioning the younger generation against this deadly blight.Shammunul Islam is Master of Development Studies, University of Dhaka.

Though the demand for condom has increased, the supply is not at all adequate,"" said Julia Ahmed of Women's Health Coalition, adding that AIDS programme started in the country long time ago, but lack of sustainable leadership and ensuring enough condom to vulnerable groups hinders the advancement of the programme.The speakers stressed the need for female condom as it can act as one of the tools of their empowerment and women can take their sexual decision by using it.However, it needs reduction of the cost of female condom and capacity building of women before using it.HIV/AIDS is also a health and socio economic issue and as such social steps to combat the disease need to be strengthened, said Sultana Kamal, former adviser to caretaker government, adding that raising awareness, supply of condoms and women's empowerment is also equally important in this regard."" It needs coordinated efforts among the government and non-government organisations,"" she added.While moderating the roundtable, Joint Editor of the Prothom Alo Abdul Quayum said there are around 11,000 AIDS patients in the country.From this it can be assumed that the actual number of patient is far more than that as a large number of people do not expose it, he added.""This also increases the chance of spreading the disease as other people cannot take any precautionary measures,"" said Quayum.Director General of Health Services Dr Shahjahan Biswas, representatives of UNFPA and other non-government organisations and law enforcers shared their experiences and made recommendations at the roundtable.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['disease', 'epidemic', 'condom', 'roundtable', 'womens', 'form', 'concentrated', 'aids', 'women', 'sexual', 'health', 'spreads', 'hiv', 'idus', 'unfpa']","Though HIV prevalence is less than one percent in the country, it has already spread as a concentrated epidemic form among the injection drug users (IDUs), said the speakers at a roundtable yesterday.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis found safe and effective for widespread use,New research presented at the HIV Drug Therapy Conference in Glasgow recently shows that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could be given to millions of people worldwide with no increased risk of safety issues during treatment.,,2018-11-04T00:00:00+06:00,"New research presented at the HIV Drug Therapy Conference in Glasgow recently shows that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could be given to millions of people worldwide with no increased risk of safety issues during treatment.PrEP is a combination of two drugs that people can take before sex to prevent HIV infection. Existing evidence shows that people who take tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) as PrEP have a 90% lower chance of being infected with HIV than people not taking it.However, widespread use of TDF/FTC can be justified only if its preventative benefits outweigh potential risks of safety issues. These new results show that PrEP is safe to use.The researchers undertook a meta-analysis of 13 randomised trials with 15,678 participants. People at risk of HIV infection were given either TDF/FTC as PrEP or no treatment (the control, or placebo). There was no significant difference in risk of high grade or serious adverse events comparing PrEP with control. The risk of serious adverse events was almost the same for both groups: 9.4% for those on PrEP and 10.1% for those on placebo. There was also no significant difference in risk of renal or bone adverse outcomes. The risk of bone fractures was 3.7% on PrEP versus 3.3% on no treatment. The risk of significant renal dysfunction was 0.1% on PrEP and 0.1% for no treatment.“In 2016, there were 1.8 million new HIV infections worldwide and the same number again in 2017,” International AIDS Society President Anton Pozniak said. “Across a range of studies, men who have sex with men have one in 30 chance of contracting HIV in a year. Other particularly vulnerable populations’, such as people who inject drugs or sex workers, have a one in 50 chance of being infected with HIV.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  “Worldwide, there are only 300,000 people estimated to be taking PrEP. This is far too small a number to prevent 1.8 million new HIV infections. Clearly, to have a significant effect on the HIV epidemic, we need to scale up PrEP to reach tens of millions of people worldwide.”Other PrEP modalities, such as long-acting injectable drugs and antibodies, are being tested in order to offer more choices of how PrEP could be taken.“Globally, there is a new HIV infection every 18 seconds,” study co-author Dr Andrew Hill, from Liverpool University, said. “Every person newly infected will then need to be treated for life, and could transmit HIV to others. We need radical changes in our prevention strategy to cut new HIV infections down to zero.”The most widely used PrEP, a combination of TDF and FTC, costs only £40 per year to make. A generic TDF/FTC course is available in the UK for £300 per year and £50 in sub-Saharan Africa. With recent legal rulings, low-cost, generic PrEP is becoming more available. This provides an opportunity, with the decreasing costs making it increasingly feasible to provide PrEP to millions of people at risk of HIV worldwide.“The World Health Organisation updated its official guidelines in 2015 to include the use of PrEP as a prevention method,” Dr. Pozniak commented. “The data is clear and it’s time to globally implement this recommendation.”These results are supported by another recent analysis, which showed no difference in adverse events between TDF/FTC and a combination of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and FTC when taken for treatment with an additional antiviral drug.","['preexposure', 'effective', 'need', 'prophylaxis', 'sex', 'millions', 'widespread', 'prep', 'adverse', 'tdfftc', 'significant', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'risk', 'safe']","PrEP is a combination of two drugs that people can take before sex to prevent HIV infection.

Cure for HIV reportedly 3 years away,A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from,,2016-04-03T00:00:00+06:00,"A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from infected cells and prevent the disease from returning.Scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University are confident that within the next three years they will be able to start human trials, the UK Daily Telegraph reported.British experts believe that this treatment, which has only been tested in labs, would allow the body to effectively “cure itself from the inside,” the newspaper reported. Human immune cells that were tested in the labs have showed no alteration to any other part of the genetic code.“The fact that for the first time we have been able to completely eliminate segments of the viral genome in the laboratory demonstrates that we should be able to eliminate it in the human body,” lead researcher Professor Kamel Khalili told The Telegraph. He reiterated that based on the recent findings, clinical trials could start within the next three years.The new technique is called Crispr/Cas9. It involves targeting the genetic code of HIV which inserts into cells, according to The Telegraph. Scientists then take the Cas9 protein and edit it so it can recognise viral code.The patient’s blood is then taken and scientists would inject Cas9, which would then seek out the HIV virus in the cells. The protein then releases and enzyme and snips out the virus. Scientists are confident that replacing 20 percent of immune cells with genetically altered cells would be enough to cure the virus.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['able', 'viral', 'reportedly', 'telegraph', 'trials', 'virus', 'scientists', 'away', 'cells', 'human', 'hiv', 'cure']","A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from infected cells and prevent the disease from returning.

This first HIV/TB Global Leaders' Forum, convened by Dr. Jorge Sampaio, the UN Secretary-General's special envoy to stop TB, seeks to galvanise leadership at all levels.The 2008 ""Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World"" report and the 2008 ""Global Tuberculosis Epidemic report of World Health Organization (WHO)"" clearly mandates much heightened urgency in responding to TB-HIV co-infection.Bangladesh continues to have the 5th highest TB burden in the world. TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Approximately one-third of the nearly 40 million PLHIV are also infected with TB. In high TB and HIV burden settings, up to 80% of TB patients may be co-infected with HIV, and half of AIDS-related deaths are caused by TB.Without proper treatment with anti-TB drugs, approximately 90% of people living with HIV die within two to three months of becoming sick with TB, even if they receive anti-retroviral treatment.Worldwide, nearly a quarter of a million people die from HIV/TB co-infection each year. This dual threat is a barrier to keeping people healthy and productive, and impacts poverty reduction plans and the broader development agenda. However, adequate treatment of TB in PLHIV can prolong their life by at least two years.HIV weakens the immune system and makes it more likely that latent TB infection will progress to active TB disease. PLHIV are up to 50 times more likely to develop TB over their lifetime.In many countries insufficient laboratory capacity to test drug-resistance is a serious impediment in scaling up TB programmes. Developing laboratories to provide rapid diagnosis of anti-TB drug-resistance, particularly for PLHIV, is of utmost importance to improve TB responses.Many countries, including Bangladesh, are making impressive gains in treating people living with HIV, but this investment and progress is squandered by a preventable and curable disease -- TB.New strategies and tools are urgently needed to tackle the challenge of TB/HIV co-infection.

HIV Patients' Right To Marry

Indian-Bangladeshi laws in perspective

Zahidul Islam Biswas

One of the hotly debated legal issues of the present time is whether HIV patients should have right to marry. Though a good number of countries have already enacted laws giving legal right to marry to the AIDS patients, it is still undecided in most of the countries of the globe. India and Bangladesh are two neighbouring countries which do not have any specific legislation settling the issue, though HIV/AIDS is considered to be a great threat to both Indian and Bangladeshi society. This write-up examines the present legal position regarding this issue in both the countries.

According to Islamic law and other modern laws, marriage is a civil contract which permits two persons of opposite sexes to live together. A successful marital life requires both mental or psychological and physical union of two persons. That is why the conditions for contract of marriage include both mental and physical elements. For entering into a marriage contract, a person has to attain a specified age, has to be mentally and physically healthy. Like any other contract, if any of these mental or physical conditions is not fulfilled, a person cannot marry. Even after marrying, if any of the conditions becomes absent, for example, if any of the spouses becomes insane or sexually incapable, the spouse is allowed to come out of that contract marital bondage. All these issues are regulated by laws of marriage and divorce.

Almost all marriage laws - for example, personal laws of Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Persian, as well as Special Marriage Act - provide the 'venereal disease' or 'sexually transmitted disease' as a ground for divorce to either husband or wife. HIV positive or AIDS is also a 'sexually transmittable disease'. Hence, legally HIV positive is also treated as a valid ground for divorce. (However, when recently an Indian court allowed divorce on the ground of HIV, it created huge controversy among the citizenry. In an earlier article titled 'whether HIV should be a valid ground for divorce' -- which can be found in The Daily Star, 17 Nov 2007 or at www.thedailystar.net/law/index.htm - I discussed about the controversy.) Now, if HIV positive is treated as a valid ground for divorce, it might also be treated as a legal incapacity to enter into a marriage contract. Then comes a question whether an HIV patient has right to marry.

Neither the Indian nor the Bangladesh Constitution has specifically recognised right to marry as a fundamental right. Though some legal experts argue that the right to marry is constitutive of one's right to life and that this right cannot be qualified on the basis of the health status of the person, seemingly, it is a legal right for only those who are mentally and physically capable. This, however, does not mean that a person suffering from a disease that makes him/her sexually incompetent loses his/her right to marry. When a person suffers from sexual disease, his/her right to marry becomes suspended only, and it revives again when the person recovers from the disease.

But when the disease is HIV positive or AIDS, which is medically treated as rarely recoverable, does the AIDS patients lose their right to marry? Suppose, an innocent 25 years youth is in some way infected with HIV positive and there is no possibility to recover from it, should his/her right to marry be suspended lifelong? These are questions to which there are no clear-cut answers in Indian or Bangladesh laws.

Legally, every young person has right to marry and to enter into a marriage contract. But unlike any commercial contract, responsibilities of the contract of marriage are not limited only within the contractual parties. Marriage is the foundation of a family as well as social relations. A couple owes a great responsibility to the family and society. In other words, right to marry is not an absolute one; it has to correspond to some other duties. For example, among the various objectives of a marriage, two prime objectives are to legalise the sexual intercourse between two persons of opposite sexes, and to procreate children. But through marriage, law does not only give right to two adult persons to satisfy their biological needs and to give birth to legitimate children, but also does impose a duty not to harm their life partner and children in any way. If a person is not able to perform this duty, he/she cannot exercise his/her right to marry.

Undoubtedly, HIV/AIDS is a deadly disease which can easily be transmitted to husband from wife and vice versa through sexual intercourse and it may infect the baby in the womb. Apparently, both Bangladeshi and Indian laws do not permit an HIV/AIDS patient to marry a healthy person and to infect their future innocent generation. These laws not only disallow it but also regard it as an offence. The penal provisions regarding this are same in both countries.

Section 269 of the Penal Code provides that whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.

Again, section 270 of the Penal Code also states whoever malignantly does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

Hence, if a person suffering from the dreadful disease AIDS, knowingly marries a man or woman and thereby transmits infection to that person, he/she would be guilty of offences indicated in sections 269 and 270 of the Penal Code.

But if the global character of AIDS, its spread, infections, and human rights of the AIDS patients are taken into consideration, such a swiping legal decision cannot be made. And logically, the above mentioned legal provisions should not be applicable to a case of HIV/AIDS. In fact, these legal provisions were made at a time when HIV/AIDS was not detected. These provisions were made taking in consideration the other common diseases that are curable by proper treatment.

However, in absence of clear statutory provisions or policy guidelines, it is the court to decide whether these legal provisions will be applicable to a case of HIV/AIDS. So far as I know, no Bangladeshi court has faced the issue till today. But Indian courts faced this issue almost a decade ago. In November 1998, a Division Bench of the Supreme Court of India held that if an HIV patient after knowing that s/he has been suffering from such dreadful disease decides to marry s/he shall be punishable under section 269 & 270 of the Indian Penal Code.

This judgement not only equated HIV to a 'venereal disease in a communicable form' but also observed that “AIDS is the product of undisciplined sexual impulse. This impulse, being the notorious human failing if not disciplined, can afflict and overtake anyone how high so ever or for that matter, how low he may be in the social strata.”

Of course, the court observed that the patients suffering from the dreadful disease AIDS deserve full sympathy. They are entitled to all respects as human beings. They should not be avoided, which otherwise, would have bad psychological impact upon them. But, sex with them or possibility thereof has to be avoided as otherwise they would infect and communicate the dreadful disease to others. The court cannot assist that person to achieve that object.

At least one point is clear from these observations that the honourable Supreme Court Bench failed to take note that HIV also spreads through other non-sexual means, and any innocent person can be a victim of HIV/AIDS anytime.

The decision of the Supreme Court sent shock waves in the HIV community throughout the world. Subsequently another petition was filed before the Supreme Court against this judgment. A three-Judge-Bench decided that the earlier above decision was made without hearing all concerned groups (especially the NGOs) who are active in this field. Therefore, the learned three-judge-bench expunged the observations made in the abovementioned judgment and restored the rights of an HIV infected person to marry.

Nevertheless, the debate whether HIV/AIDS patients should have right to marry is not over. However, the overwhelming opinion world wide is that law should not take away the right of an HIV/AIDS patient to marry, as it is a basic human right. What law can do is to provide guidelines how they should exercise their right to marry. For example, as Indian Supreme Court guided, an HIV positive person must disclose his/her status to the other party. Then, if an infected or uninfected person knowingly wants to marry an HIV/AIDS patient, law should not bar them. Again after marriage, their right to parenthood shall be suspended; so long scientific development ensures that HIV/AIDS parents can give birth to an uninfected baby.

In fact, HIV/AIDS is not just a disease. It is a global problem. So, all the issues related to AIDS should be decided globally. The world community should come forward to adopt a unique policy based upon human rights of HIV patients. Hopefully, UNAIDS has already been working for this purpose. Among the 12 International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights provided by UNAIDS, guideline 3 is very much pertinent here. It says, states should review and reform public health laws to ensure that they adequately address public health issues raised by HIV/AIDS, that their provisions applicable to casually transmitted diseases are not inappropriately applied to HIV/AIDS and that they are consistent with international human rights obligations.

When it is important to see how much of these guidelines are being followed by the states, it must be kept in mind that law and policy is never a complete solution of any problem, but a partial solution only. As it is claimed by AIDS activists, the basis of discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS is fear, and this fear comes mostly from wrong or distorted information. So, along side law and policy but with the same gravity, these countries must adopt a sufficient measure to correct misunderstandings about HIV.

AIDS threat looms up: Aggressive surveillance needed,Health officials and concerned citizenry in the country are grappling with the national implications of AIDS crisis that hovers over lands beyond the borders of Bangladesh  and have been trying to come up with means to combat the new threat that it poses to Ba,,2013-12-14T00:03:03+06:00,"Health officials and concerned citizenry in the country are grappling with the national implications of AIDS crisis that hovers over lands beyond the borders of Bangladesh  and have been trying to come up with means to combat the new threat that it poses to Bangladesh. Experts see clear indications that the disease that once was supposed to be confined to some specific areas is now spreading to wider residential neighbourhoods.The alarm bell is ringing at the door. Figures so far available in India are restricted to the so-called high risk groups-prostitutes, heterosexuals, drug addicts, truck drivers and migrants. Africa disproportionately bears the burden of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Although only 11%  of the world's population lives in Africa, roughly 67% of those living with HIV/AIDS are in Africa. In Africa there were 22.4 million people living with HIV and the country recorded 1.9 million new infections in 2008. An estimated 14 million children in Africa have been orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS.  Officially, no exact statistics are available that speak of the country's middle class becoming AIDS victims as yet.  Reports that pour in from the neighbouring country, India indicate that there are about 5.134 million HIV infected people in India, constituting about 0.6% of the total population.  Although the percentage is small, the numbers are staggering, the highest of any country, overtaking South Africa. All these reports make people genuinely concerned, since in no time, the virus may cross the borders with the traveling people and can play havoc in the country.On the other hand, that the reported HIV positive numbers in the country still remain relatively quite low, not anything to cause alarm, is no surprise. It reflects the general level of ignorance and a sort of apathy of the people and administration. The actual number infected with the virus may be quite high. The majority of the people who are infected now don't even know they are ill. We are now talking about a generation that will have developed AIDS sometime after the year 2020 or later. And the country simply does not have the wherewithal to deal with any such crisis.Complacency and ignorance do not always pay as it did not in the CIS (previously USSR)  countries. Unicef reports that abuse of injected drugs accounts for most of the region's infections of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. However it noted that sexual transmission is on the rise in Belarus and Ukraine. The total number of infections in the region more than doubled from 4,20,000 in 1998 to I million in 2001.  While that is small compared to 28.5 million in sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of infection in some East European and CIS countries is the world's highest.Most worrisome, the virus now percolates insidiously and afflicts low risk individuals like house wives and children of wealthy people.  Speaking about India, a doctor who heads the Mumbai-based AIDS research and control centre says, “infected housewives and children are a clear indication of just how much the AIDS virus has advanced in India.   He estimated that one out of 10 HIV patients is a housewife.In our country, the first HIV patient was detected in 1989. Till the end of 1996, the country registered just 79 HIV positive cases, officially known, out of which 15 were female. It was officially known from Health Ministry sources that 82 AIDS- infected persons died last year and the number of deaths so far recorded was 472 in the country.However, UNAIDS estimates that the number of people living with HIV in the country may be as high as 12,000.Although still considered to be a low prevalence country, Bangladesh remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic, given its overpopulation, dire poverty, gender inequality and high level of multiple sexual relationships. UNAIDS estimates that without any intervention the prevalence in the general adult population could be as high as 8% by 2025.  Social researchers grimly say, “In our country with all the economic problems- rising unemployment and drug abuse, only AIDS was missing. Now we, too have not been spared.  If the number continues to rise, it will be especially ominous for the country, since the country does not have medical facilities, physicians or drugs to adequately treat the disease. Noticeably, in the United States, it took more than a decade of massive public education and millions of dollars in research before the appalling number of HIV cases finally stabilized. Speaking about Bangladesh, the country today is so economically weak that it can't even treat the scourge of prevalent disease like diarrhea, malaria,  tuberculosis etc., let alone fund its anti-AIDS effort. “It is, as if, we're standing on the beach, watching a giant wave coming right at us”, says one medical expert in the country. “We know it, we see it, and we can do almost nothing about it.  We are just going to be swept away”.In our country what we have to be careful is about the possibility of transmission of this deadly scourge through “heterosexual” chains. At least in India as well as our country, that mode accounts for almost two thirds of almost all HIV positive cases. In India as well as in our country, promiscuity is the single most important way by which this scourge has the possibility of spreading. People must know its incubation period,  that keeps the  virus hidden for a long time and after a certain time it explodes in a virulent form almost as an epidemic. The most potent reason for its rapid transmission is because the symptoms take an average of five years to show up. So an infected person can pass the virus unknowingly to scores of people. This is unlike other sexually transmitted diseases where the symptoms appear in the first few weeks or months of infection itself and the other reason is that middle class never believed that they wee vulnerable to the insidious culprit.Shockingly, the old concept s of societal ethos, mores and morality seem to be breaking down. Most revealing, a recently released research data conducted  by a West Indian based  Institute  on the sexual mores of middle class and upper class Indians reveals that of the 16,154 persons surveyed as many as 43 per cent of them admitted to having had pre-marital sex. Among those who were married, one out of five people said they had extra-marital relations. Most of these people in these groups did not use condoms while having sex since they did never comprehend that such behaviour exposed them to sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS. Experts  attribute this shift in sexual behaviour of the middle or lower  class of working people  as changes in the work place as a major cause. Lack of housing facilities in the work place has spawned a breed of workers who spend half their working lives away from home. At the same time women have become an increasingly visible part in many places away from their homes. All these factors taken together, one can only see the settings for an increasing number of casual sex relationships.  Till recently, many people in our country considered AIDS a scourge of the libertine West that posed no threat to a conservative society like ours based on monogamous marriages. Bangladesh, these days, has hundreds of thousands of sailors, construction workers and other professional groups who work abroad for a time and a continual tide of students and business men returning from overseas. The virus has either spread or is likely to spread from returnees carrying this insidious infection because they were not tested on their arrival.  Most people in the country and the government prefer to ignore it.  Unsurprisingly, the first AIDS case surfaced in the country in 1989 –the carrier being a returnee from abroad.Social scientists point out that the growing affluence of a certain class of people and the influence of movies have something to do  with the changing moral values. And without contradiction, one can say that the influence of the West is not an escapable factor. Shockingly, we have borrowed the gloss but not the ability to fight a crisis. While in the West, maintaining multiple sexual relationship is now considered a “high risk” behaviour, in our country it has become just a symbol of liberation. At the same time, women are shedding their inhibitions and sexual ambitions of both the groups are running high.In the face of the impending AIDS threat that is likely to jolt the country by the end of the year 2025, as UNAIDS predict  as the tide of migrant workers returning  home continues to increase, the government from now on, will have to launch an intensive programme to halt the spread of the disease with some practical steps. Health ministry must ensure that hospitals and clinics conduct safe blood transfusion of patients and think seriously about screening those who they thought might be using drugs –focusing mainly on unemployed young men and IV drug users. Lastly, both the administration and people must contend with the fact that AIDS is no longer a medical problem, it is a social problem. And the startling rise in the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases, health officials contend, is an early warning about the spread of the dreadful AIDS. The National AIDS surveillance programme unveiled in 1997 has done a pretty good job by promoting safe blood supply, rational use of blood and blood products through screening, provision of care and support systems and amendment of laws to prevent discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS. In most of the countries of the world, the AIDS virus has spread beyond the most vulnerable groups and into the society's mainstream. It robs economies of the workers, families of their support and children of their parents.The writer is a columnist of The Daily Star.  E-mail: aukhandk@gmail.com    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['threat', 'infected', 'aids', 'surveillance', 'number', 'million', 'aggressive', 'virus', 'sexual', 'country', 'needed', 'africa', 'hiv', 'india', 'looms']","In Africa there were 22.4 million people living with HIV and the country recorded 1.9 million new infections in 2008.

The place is called Nazma Boarding Brothel. Among the twenty brothel-villages that are legal in the country, Nazma Boarding is one of them.The ugly truth is that a lot of sex-workers inside the brothel have little to no knowledge about HIV and STDs whereas they are most vulnerable to these diseases. To help this disregarded group of people in the society, Awareness 360, a non-profit youth organisation, held a health awareness campaign on 9 August 2017 at Nazma Boarding Brothel. Shomy Hasan Chowdhury and Rijve Arefin were the co-ordinators of the project called Make Brothels in Bangladesh Safe and it was funded by Global Changemakers.The first session of the workshop included awareness on hygiene. The road that led to the workshop stage from the entrance of the brothel was filled with garbage. Rijve Arefin explained the importance of maintaining hygiene and not to throw garbage on the road.In the second session, Shomy Hasan Chowdhury talked about menstrual hygiene. The sex-workers were encouraged to talk about menstruation, a natural part of the female body. They were assured that there was no need to feel ashamed of a natural process. Also, they were provided with free sanitary napkins and instructed not to throw them out in the open after using.Next, information regarding HIV, STDs were provided to the sex-workers. The risks of having unprotected sex, the importance of using condoms and symptoms of STDs and HIV were demonstrated to them. They were informed further about the risks of using unclean and used syringe and made aware of the fact that conceiving a child while having HIV would transmit the disease to the unborn child as well.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  The special guest at the workshop, Former National Advisor, Food Safety Program of FAO-UN and Senior Assistant Director of Department of Fisheries, Hasan Ahmmed Chowdhury, spoke about food protection. Nutrition is very important in fighting against disease. Hence, he advised them to eat healthy, keep the kitchen clean and eat in a clean place. He also told them to boil their water and dishes and be aware in order to prevent any unwanted illness.Along with these, pamphlets and posters were distributed that included six steps of washing hands properly.In the process, the organisers had to make sure the sex-workers did not get bored. Few performances from the sex-workers were also encouraged to make sure they had a good time. They sang and danced and enjoyed themselves.To organise a workshop inside a brothel was very challenging. One of the coordinators, Shomy Hasan Chowdhury says, “We found a local contact in Nazma Boarding Brothel and through him, we talked to their committee members. Convincing them was pretty tough. Arranging the whole programme, travelling to Mymensingh from Dhaka multiple times were even tougher. We needed to get permission from the District Commissioner of Mymensingh because without his consent we would not be able to get Police Protection. After struggling through a rigorous process we managed both.”It was a day long workshop and we had to come back to our regular lives, while they were still trapped in that cramped brothel. Many stories were left to be heard for another day. Therefore, more of such workshops are needed to be organised and attention to be paid.","['brothel', 'workshop', 'hygiene', 'workshops', 'stds', 'nazma', 'std', 'shomy', 'boarding', 'chowdhury', 'hasan', 'hiv', 'sexworkers']","The place is called Nazma Boarding Brothel.

The World Health Organization has also recommended that sex workers adopt a PrEP regimen.The United States, in 2012, and France three years later were the first two countries to authorise this form of preventative treatment. Others have followed suit, including Canada, Kenya, Brazil, Thailand, Australia, Belgium, Scotland and South Africa, where 19 percent of the population live with HIV/AIDS.Seatbelts and airbagsIn France -- the first country in which PrEP has available without cost -- ""about five in 10,000 people"" should be taking it, said Molina. So far, there has been no measurable effect: in 2016, France saw 6,000 new infections, the same level as for the last ten years.""The number of people who have started PrEP -- about 3,000 -- is probably not enough to have had a statistical impact,"" France's public health watchdog agency concluded recently.Prep can be taken regularly (one pill a day), or ""as needed"" before and after sexual encounters. But treatment protocols must be scrupulously respected to ensure protection.""We don't yet have a vaccine against AIDS, but PrEP is a new and effective form of prevention alongside condoms,"" said Molina, who leads the ongoing Ipergay study for France's AIDS Research Agency.Francois, 55, is gay and lives in Paris.

""The sword hanging over my head has vanished,"" he said in an interview. ""The day one forgets a condom or it breaks, I no longer have that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.""In France, ""PrEPers"", as they are called, are required to have blood tests every three months, in part to scan for other sexually transmitted diseases not blocked by the treatment.PrEP is not without critics.The main objection is that it encourages risky behaviour, including sex without condoms.Generics ""It is important to protect against other STDs,"" said Molina. ""In a car, it better to use a seatbelt and have an airbag too.""Francois says he ""uses condoms with strangers,"" but not with regular partners. ""PrEPers who don't use condoms at all probably didn't use them before either,"" he speculated.Coverage of PrEP's cost under public health insurance has also been criticised as tantamount to subsidising reckless sex.""A doctor shouldn't pass judgment, but rather protect health,"" retorted Molina. ""If PrEP helps to avoid infection, it has to be offered to patients.""Besides, he added, taking the drug preventively cost less in the long run than treating HIV-positive patients for life.The European patent for Truvada, made by US firm Gilead, expired at the end of July, bringing generics onto the market. As a result, the average price of treatment has dropped from 500 to 180 euros ($600 to $210).PrEP is prescribed in Germany, but is not reimbursed. In England, health officials have recently recruited 10,000 volunteers for a three-year study to gauge it effectiveness.""PrEP alone will not stem the epidemic,"" said Molina. ""The three-pronged approach needed remains the same: treatment of HIV-positive patients, frequent testing of high-risk populations, and prevention, via condoms and now, PrEP.""","['sex', 'world', 'aids', 'prep', 'taking', 'molina', 'health', 'treatment', 'shield', 'condoms', 'france']","Taking a drug normally prescribed to treat AIDS as a way to shield against the deadly disease -- known as PrEP -- is catching on, and proponents hope that it will soon have a measurable impact in reducing the number of infections.

Reuters, Washington

A cheap, generic drug long used to treat herpes may also help control the AIDS virus, U.S. researchers reported very recently.

They found that acyclovir can work against HIV, but only in tissues that are also infected with herpes.

The findings, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, help explain why some studies have shown that people taking acyclovir have lower levels of HIV, yet others show that taking acyclovir does not prevent infection with the AIDS virus.

The herpes virus itself changes the drug into a form that can work against HIV, said Dr. Leonid Margolis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who helped lead the study. ""If you suppress herpes, HIV also goes down,"" Margolis said.

Acyclovir was the first drug to be designed and made synthetically, without the use of any compounds from plants or animals, Margolis said.

It is also very safe, as it does not become active until it encounters a herpes virus — usually herpes simplex 2, the strain that causes genital herpes. The virus completes a chemical reaction called phosphorylation, turning the acyclovir into an active compound.

Researchers had noticed that patients with HIV who also took acyclovir for herpes infections tended to have less virus in their blood, a measure called viral load. The lower the viral load, the healthier an HIV patient is.

But several high-profile experiments aimed at preventing HIV infection by treating patients for herpes failed.

Margolis thinks he knows why.

""If you test acyclovir against HIV in pure cell lines, it doesn't work,"" he said.

And in the prevention studies, doctors were trying to completely suppress herpes. ""If you suppress herpes virus completely, there is nothing to phosphorylate,"" he said. So perhaps lower or more infrequent doses might be more effective, he said. This will have to be tested.

And the good news is that a patient does not have to be infected with genital herpes to benefit. Any herpes virus will do, including HHV6 and HHV7, viruses that cause a nearly universal childhood infection sometimes called roseola.

Like HIV, herpes takes up permanent residence in the body and cannot be eliminated. But drugs can suppress both to prevent symptoms. Adding acyclovir to the cocktails used to treat HIV may strengthen the mix, Margolis said.

HIV infects 33 million people globally. It has killed 25 million and there is no cure and no vaccine.","['help', 'margolis', 'work', 'aids', 'acyclovir', 'control', 'infection', 'virus', 'herpes', 'suppress', 'hiv', 'lower', 'drug']","12:00 AM, September 13, 2008 / LAST MODIFIED: 12:00 AM, September 13, 2008Reuters, WashingtonA cheap, generic drug long used to treat herpes may also help control the AIDS virus, U.S. researchers reported very recently.

The region accounts for half the world's infected population, with women and girls disproportionately affected at 60 percent.Sixty percent of all people who receive anti-retroviral therapy live in east and southern Africa which, along with west and central Europe and the Americas, is on target to meet the so-called 90-90-90 targets set by the UN, said the report.By 2020, states the plan, 90 percent of infected people must know their status, of whom 90 percent must be on treatment. In 90 percent of those, the virus will be ""suppressed"" by medicine to the extent that it cannot function or replicate.By 2016, 70 percent of infected people knew their status, said the new report. Of those, 77 percent were on treatment, and 82 percent had virus suppression.UNAIDS expressed concern about two regions with worsening AIDS trends: the Middle East-North Africa, and eastern Europe-central Asia. Both are areas marred by conflict and political uncertainty.New HIV infections rose by 60 percent in eastern Europe and central Asia, and deaths by almost a third from 2010 to 2016.In the Middle East and North Africa, the number of AIDS deaths increased by a fifth in the last six years.""Globally, progress has been significant, but there is still more work to do,"" the authors said in a statement.""Around 30 percent of people living with HIV still do not know their HIV status, 17.1 million people living with HIV do not have access to anti retroviral therapy, and more than half of all people living with HIV are not virally suppressed.""Of the total infected population, over two million were children younger than 15, said UNAIDS. Only 43 percent of them were on treatment.New infections among children almost halved from 300,000 in 2010 to 160,000 last year, said the report.This was partly due to more and more HIV-infected pregnant women -- 76 percent in 2016 -- having access to drugs blocking virus transmission to their offspring.","['turning', '2016', 'amid', 'infections', 'half', 'infected', 'tide', 'aids', 'million', 'lives', 'deaths', 'virus', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'claimed']","AIDS claimed a million lives in 2016, almost half the 2005 toll that marked the peak of the deadly epidemic, said a UN report Thursday proclaiming ""the scales have tipped"".

There were an estimated 350,000 new HIV infections in the Region in 2013 -- the second-highest regional HIV burden after Sub-Saharan Africa.Partnerships between health systems and communities in the Region have improved access to life-saving treatment, increased domestic resources for HIV/AIDS programmes and reduced stigmatisation and discrimination. For example:Community organisations have helped formulate, implement and scale up the evidence-based recommendations contained in WHO's “Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations;”In India, the Avahan HIV programme helped strengthen community-based organisations, leading to a sharp decline in the epidemic in several high-prevalence states. The lessons learnt are being incorporated in the national response, helping to ensure sustainability;In China, the government is increasingly engaging with civil society organisations. Nongovernmental organisations such as AIDS Care China are providing a key bridge between government HIV programmes and key populations;The governments of the Philippines and Thailand, two of many countries where the MSM HIV epidemic is surging alarmingly, are working actively with MSM organisations that connect communities with HIV services.All of these examples fit the theme of World AIDS Day 2014: Closing the Gap. This theme is about empowering all people to access the services they need.Less than half of all HIV-positive people across the Asia-Pacific Region are aware of their status. An estimated 1.5 million people in the Region are receiving antiretroviral treatment -- about one third of the Region's HIV-positive population. This is a significant improvement compared with a few years ago, but the journey is less than half complete. WHO Member States can do better. It is only by closing testing and treatment gaps and reaching all in need that we can achieve our goal of ending AIDS in Asia by 2030.  We need to overcome challenges. Key populations continue to face stigmatisation and discrimination, including punitive legislation. This must change. WHO consolidated guidelines are guided by human rights principles and call for governments to enforce protective laws to eliminate discrimination and violence faced by key populations.  Evidence is adding to a dynamic response.

Roll out treatment as prevention,,,2011-07-23T00:00:00+06:00,"The Lancet, a leading global medical journal, recently published an editorial comment that emphasises the critical role of expanding access to HIV treatment under a “Treatment as Prevention” strategy to stop the HIV pandemic.The publication of the editorial comment coincided with the opening of the 6th IAS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention (IAS 2011) in Rome, Italy from July 17-20.The commentary – by Dr. Julio Montaner, director of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE) and Past President of the International AIDS Society (IAS) – strongly reinforced the view that the benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) extend beyond the remarkable effectiveness of the treatment to prevent the onset of AIDS and prolong life, to dramatically reduce HIV transmission. Based on HAART’s effectiveness in reducing transmission, Dr. Montaner called on the international community to support an immediate and expanded roll out of HAART under the Treatment as Prevention strategy, as pioneered by the BC-CfE in British Columbia, Canada.“Treatment as Prevention is one of the most important and promising additions to the range of prevention strategies available to us today,” said Dr. Elly Katabira, President of the IAS and Chair of IAS 2011.Current HIV treatment reduces the level of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, thus improving the health of HIV-positive individuals. At the same time, the treatment decreases the level of HIV in sexual fluids to undetectable levels, thereby reducing the likelihood of HIV transmission by over 90 per cent.“The evidence is clear: treatment conclusively prevents morbidity, mortality and transmission,” said Dr. Montaner. “We now have ample and compelling evidence that treatment prevents HIV transmission during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as well as in sexual and injection drug use settings. The challenge remains to optimise the impact of this valuable intervention. Failure to do so is not an option.”A recent study by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that immediate use of HAART led to a 96% decrease in the risk of HIV transmission among heterosexual couples where one partner is HIV positive. “These results are a real scientific breakthrough and a game changer in the response to HIV,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).The Treatment as Prevention model has been embraced by UNAIDS and the World Health Organisation within the Treatment 2.0 initiative, announced last year as a central pillar of the global strategy to respond to HIV.In February 2011, in consultation with the BC-CfE and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), China became the first country to incorporate Treatment as Prevention as part of its national HIV/AIDS strategy to control HIV/AIDS over the next five years.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'hivaids', 'roll', 'strategy', 'transmission', 'health', 'treatment', 'ias', 'hiv', 'dr', 'montaner']","The Lancet, a leading global medical journal, recently published an editorial comment that emphasises the critical role of expanding access to HIV treatment under a “Treatment as Prevention” strategy to stop the HIV pandemic.

Photo Courtesy: International Partnership for Microbicides via APWomen who inserted a vaginal ring coated with an anti-AIDS drug once a month were partially protected against HIV infection, researchers said Monday as they released long-awaited results from two large studies in Africa.The ring proved safe although the protection was modest, reducing overall HIV infection by less than a third. Surprisingly, the ring worked far better in women 25 and older, leaving researchers wondering if the youngest women, who got little to no benefit, simply didn't use the device properly.Women make up more than half of the nearly 37 million people worldwide living with HIV, most of them in hard-hit Africa, and scientists have long sought tools to help them protect themselves when their partners won't use a condom.Despite questions the studies raise, the nonprofit International Partnership for Microbicides said it considered the results promising enough to seek appropriate regulatory approval for wider use in parts of Africa.""You can't just say, 'Until something is perfect, we're going to wait,'"" said Dr. Zeda Rosenberg, founding chief executive officer of IPM. ""We have to give women options.""""For a woman to have a prevention tool that she can control is an incredibly important goal,"" added Dr. Jared Baeten of the University of Washington, who led a National Institutes of Health-funded study of the ring. ""I want rings, pills and other strategies to be on the shelf for women so they can make choices for what's going to work for them.""Aside from condoms, HIV prevention tools include taking a daily anti-AIDS pill. That so-called ""pre-exposure prophylaxis"" isn't widely available in poor countries, and other attempts at HIV-blocking vaginal gels haven't yet panned out.But the age disparity found in the vaginal ring studies is so puzzling that the NIH plans to consult with outside experts on next research steps.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  While women need a discreet form of HIV prevention, ""it's going to be absolutely critical"" to determine if the younger women really didn't follow instructions, or if there was some biological difference, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Vaginal rings are sold in the U.S. for birth control, but the anti-AIDS version tested in Africa contained no contraception. Instead, it slowly oozes an experimental virus-blocking drug named dapivirine into the surrounding vaginal tissue. Women would replace the ring once a month, when it was time for another dose.Two studies involving more than 4,500 women in Africa are being presented at the Retrovirus Conference in Boston, comparing women who used the dapivirine ring with those given an identical-looking but drug-free version. It offered modest protection, reducing by 27 percent to 31 percent the participants' overall risk of HIV.But closer inspection of the large NIH-funded ASPIRE study in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe turned up something odd. Ring users who were 25 and older were 61 percent less likely to be infected while those ages 18 to 21 essentially got no benefit, Baeten said.While the ring is designed to stay in place for an entire month before being replaced, there are signs the younger women didn't use it as regularly, said Baeten, whose results also were published online Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. He said women had to get comfortable with the how to use a device they'd never seen before, but those who used the ring continuously saw protection that continued throughout the 2½-year study.""The ring must be used consistently to achieve protection,"" the IPM's Annalene Nel told reporters Monday as she discussed the second study, called the Ring Study. Conducted in South Africa and Uganda, that study likewise showed a trend toward greater protection for women over 21, she said.While that study isn't completed yet, the IPM said South African regulators asked researchers to switch all the remaining study participants to the dapivirine-coated ring rather than the placebo version.Early studies of those daily anti-AIDS pills also found less protection in younger people, who did better at sticking with the tablets only after their effectiveness was proven, said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, which advocates for a range of HIV prevention tools. He said there is ""a global imperative"" to answer remaining questions about the ring.","['prevention', 'partially', 'studies', 'protection', 'protects', 'vaginal', 'finds', 'women', 'ring', 'study', 'africa', 'hiv', 'antiaids']","Women who inserted a vaginal ring coated with an anti-AIDS drug once a month were partially protected against HIV infection, researchers said Monday as they released long-awaited results from two large studies in Africa.

Bangladesh and high-level meeting on AIDS,Photo: Noor Alam / Drik News,,2011-06-08T00:00:00+06:00,"Photo: Noor Alam / Drik NewsFrom June 8 to 10, world leaders will convene in New York City at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) High Level Meeting on AIDS. The gathering of heads of states and other leaders from government, the scientific community, civil society and the private sector offers a unique opportunity to review progress, share lessons learned and chart the future course of the global AIDS response.The meeting comes at a pivotal moment in the history of the epidemic: Thirty years ago, in June 1981, scientists in the United States identified the first case of an immune system failure that would later be defined as AIDS. Ten years ago, at a landmark UNGA Special Session on AIDS, world leaders declared that AIDS was a ""global emergency"" and called for an ""urgent, coordinated and sustained response"" to the epidemic.Now, three decades into the epidemic, what is the global scorecard for the AIDS response? According to a recent report of the UN Secretary-General, more than six million people were accessing lifesaving antiretroviral treatment in low and middle-income countries at the end of 2010 -- up from just 400,000 in 2003. Over the past decade, the number of people newly infected with HIV declined by nearly 20%. And, for the first time in 2009, more than 50% of HIV-positive women were able to ensure that their babies were born HIV free.However, the report underscores that the gains are fragile. The HIV epidemic continues to outpace the response, with an estimated two new HIV infections for every individual starting treatment. Global AIDS resources have flat-lined, and critical sources of leadership and accountability remain untapped.To accelerate progress in the AIDS response, the secretary-general has called on the global community to adopt six goals for the year 2015 -- targets that will be reviewed and endorsed by participants in the June High Level Meeting on AIDS:* Reduce by 50% the sexual transmission of HIV -- including among key populations, such as young people, men who have sex with men, and in the context of sex work -- and prevent all new HIV infections as a result of injecting drug use;* Provide HIV treatment for 13 million people;* Reduce by 50% tuberculosis deaths in people living with HIV;* Eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child, keep mothers alive, and improve the health of women, children and families.* Ensure equal access to education for children orphaned and made vulnerable by AIDS; and* Reduce by 50% the number of countries with HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay and residence.In recent years, Bangladesh has made significant progress towards these goals. From an early start, even before the first HIV infection was detected in the country, Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in keeping HIV infections low. We started our response with quality targeted interventions for most at risk populations, implemented through a human rights based approach and partnering NGOs and civil society. This has helped us keep HIV infection levels low for more than twenty years since the infection was first detected in the country. We have ensured that people who require antiretroviral treatment get them, and the school textbooks have included HIV and life skills education for all school children.Despite these achievements, there is no room for complacency. Bangladesh has a young population and HIV awareness levels among them are often low and substantial numbers of people including international migrants are vulnerable. Vulnerability increases when women are not in a position to exercise their full rights or when they are subjected to gender-based violence. We are committed to ensuring universal access to services for these young and vulnerable populations. The AIDS response requires a long-term commitment and for this we must ensure predictable and sustainable sources of funding.The government of Bangladesh is committed to ensuring universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services to everyone in Bangladesh. We must promote evidence, informed and rights-based approach that is responsive to changing dynamics of the HIV epidemic in Bangladesh. We would ensure that women and people from marginalised sections of the community are given priority in the national AIDS response that is part of the country's Sixth Five Year Plan.Our government will move to integrate AIDS services in the community clinic service delivery mechanism in phases to benefit the rural population. Most importantly, we shall try to minimise stigma and discrimination that is rife against people living with HIV and other population groups who are vulnerable to HIV infection.The writer is Minister, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['bangladesh', 'epidemic', 'meeting', 'aids', 'women', 'response', 'vulnerable', 'treatment', 'low', 'hiv', 'global', 'highlevel']","Now, three decades into the epidemic, what is the global scorecard for the AIDS response?

“Prevention is better than treatment”,"Working for CARE BANGLADESH for the last eight years, Sakina Sultana sounds",Supriti Sarkar,2015-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Working for CARE BANGLADESH for the last eight years, Sakina Sultana soundsvery enthusiastic talking about the current situation and hurdles that Bangladeshi women face in terms of the awareness of HIV/AIDS.HIV rates in Bangladesh are low, under 0.1%, however certain population groups, such as people who inject drugs (PWID) are more at risk of HIV infection. “FWID (females who inject drugs) are usually viewed as the most vulnerable, as they are at risk of GBV and HIV. That is they are usually the last to be provided with the drug in a group of drug users sharing needles.” says Sakina.  The prevalence of AIDS is controlled and confined in Bangladesh making the number of HIV positive individuals low but not decreasing. “Donors seem uninterested in providing further funds for this reason”, says Sakina.Women become victims of gender based violence and inadvertently get infected with HIV for a number of reasons. Often most FWID will resort to sexual acts, unprotected in exchange for drugs or money to buy them. Many men will even inject women with drugs in order to coerce them into having sex. This often makes them victims of gang rapes and other forms of physical assault.  Sometimes it is their own intimate partners who force them to have sex with others for the aforementioned reasons. Most female PWIDs are also victims of gender based violence. The lack of funds has led to a lot of downsizing and closing down of PWIDS centres around the country and currently there are only two such centres for FWID.“Society stigmatizes and alienates drug users and if the user is a woman, the effects are multiplied that only leads them to relapse again. This is a vicious cycle.” Says Sakina disappointingly. Although Bangladesh's prevalence is not something to be worried about, the fact that it is still present is a matter of concern for those who work closely on these issues. Due to lack of funding, HIV screening is also another factor amongst female external migrants. “Our neighbouring countries have a higher prevalence rate and there is a constant flow of external migrants from Bangladesh. As HIV screening is an ethical issue,  it cannot be done without the consent of the individual and the social stigma related to the disease makes the whole process complicated.” says Sakina. Women make up a significant portion of the cross-border mobile population. The lack of necessary legal documents or proper education makes them easier to manipulate. Many will allow them to cross borders in exchange for sexual favours and reluctance has more so than often resulted in gender based violence.Projects such as 'Emphasis' that work in cooperation with local NGOs, India, Nepal work on two mobility routes between Bangladesh-India and Nepal-India by delivering focused interventions at source, transit and destination points. A Regional Secretariat is based in Nepal to provide overall program direction and day to day oversight of country level program teams in Bangladesh. The project has yielded significant results supporting the importance of screening but funding is limited to make any big changes at present.Targeted interventionsto support families of drug users or the users themselves are insufficient in halting HIV infection rates. What Bangladesh needs is comprehensive programming that focuses on high risk groups, as well as the general population especially adolescents. “We are all aware of what HIV/AIDS is but little  is being done to teach the masses about HIV infection and prevention.”    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'bangladesh', 'based', 'better', 'work', 'women', 'users', 'sakina', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'victims', 'drugs', 'drug']","That is they are usually the last to be provided with the drug in a group of drug users sharing needles.” says Sakina.

New WHO guidelines to end AIDS in Bangladesh,,,2013-11-08T00:00:48+06:00,"BANGLADESH'S swift and targeted response to HIV has had significant successes, but more must be done. Our approach must be united, vigilant and proactive. The new 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and UNAIDS Treatment 2015 initiative are an exciting leap forward that put our goals of “Zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths” in focus. The global experience with HIV and AIDS is that it is not a problem that will go away on its own, or that can be managed as a status-quo; we must aggressively pursue the vision of an HIV free Bangladesh -- and we must do this now.The new WHO guidelines recommend that anti-retroviral treatment (ART), comprising of medicines that can control the virus, begin when a patient's CD4 cell count falls to 500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. CD4 cells are the white blood cells that HIV attacks, and is used as an indicator of any person's immune status once diagnosed as HIV positive, as these blood cells are responsible for maintaining a person's immunity. This is a significant change from the former guidelines, which recommended that ART begin when the CD4 cell count decreased to 350. Essentially, the new WHO guidelines recommend that people living with HIV receive treatment earlier, as recent evidence indicates that earlier ART will help people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives, and substantially reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others.The current provision of ART services to people living with HIV in Bangladesh is commendable -- once people are identified as HIV positive with a CD4 count of 350 or lower, they usually receive the treatment and care that they need free of charge. The new WHO ART guidelines recommend that ART begin at CD4 count of 500, thus the number of people who require treatment in Bangladesh will increase remarkably, which presents a challenge. Bangladesh needs innovative solutions to strengthen outreach, testing, and counseling services; and to ensure that these are in the upazilas that need them. Achieving universal access to quality facilities and services will secure the future of the “Treatment as Prevention” paradigm; which requires provision of ART to all HIV-positive people, sero-discordant couples and pregnant women, regardless of CD4 count, in order to reduce the risk of further transmission.The HIV/AIDS programme, led by the government of Bangladesh and supported by UNAIDS, WHO, Unicef and UNFPA, has had considerable success thus far and the overall prevalence in the country has remained below 0.1%. The prevalence of HIV in people who inject drugs (PWID) in Dhaka was 7% in 2007 and 5.3% in 2011, so it seems to be contained; and HIV prevalence has remained low (within 0 to 2%) in other key populations such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender persons.However, the demographics of Bangladesh present considerable challenges to the HIV prevention programme. Bangladesh is a densely populated country, with enduring poverty, low levels of education, gender inequality and high level of cross-border travel.As the AIDS epidemic changes shape, so must the HIV prevention programme. Improved surveillance and a national management information system (MIS) will be the cornerstones of this new phase of Treatment as Prevention. Doctors, laboratory technicians, nurses and counselors need to be deployed to scale up existing services where more work can be done; community members need to be mobilised to enhance care and support services; and additional resources need to be targeted at the source of new infection, such as at-risk migrant workers.Ultimately, we are united in our vision of a Bangladesh free of HIV and AIDS; the new WHO guidelines and scaling up of the Treatment as Prevention paradigm may be the future, based on country context and stakeholder consultations to take place as per WHO recommendations.The writers are Minister, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, WHO representative to Bangladesh, World Health Organization, and UNAIDS Country Coordinator, Bangladesh, respectively.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'need', 'bangladesh', 'end', 'aids', 'guidelines', 'count', 'treatment', 'services', 'cd4', 'hiv', 'art']","This is a significant change from the former guidelines, which recommended that ART begin when the CD4 cell count decreased to 350.

The red ribbon,,,2007-12-02T00:00:00+06:00,"The Red Ribbon is the global symbol for solidarity with HIV-positive people and those living with AIDS. World AIDS Day, observed December 1 each year, is dedicated to raising awareness about the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection.UNAIDS and the Who estimate that the total number of people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has reached its highest level. As of 2006, there were an estimated 40.3 million people living with HIV.AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. Despite recent, improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3.1 million lives in 2005, of which more than half a million were children.The concept of a World AIDS Day originated at the 1988 World Summit of Ministers of Health on Programs for AIDS Prevention. Since then, it has been taken up by governments, international organisations and charities around the world.Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to West Africa. Both forms of the virus are believed to have originated in West-Central Africa, and jumped species (zoonosis) from primates to humans.HIV/AIDS infection in Bangladesh, so far, is within fair limit, but is appreciatively  wide open to increase owing to prevalence of certain behavioural patterns and risk factors.A Who report on Bangladesh still considers it a low HIV/AIDS prevalent country. The Who estimates there are 13,000 HIV-positive people in the country, and HIV prevalence among the adult population is less than 0.01 percent.The swift rise of HIV/AIDS has been marked among the high-risk groups, including sex workers and injecting-drug users (IDUs). For example, in a pocket of central Bangladesh, the HIV prevalence rate among the IDUs jumped from 1.4 percent to 8.9 per cent in a three-year period.According to the latest information available with the National AIDS/STD Program (NASP), 874 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed as of December 31, 2006.According to National HIV Surveillance findings, the rate of HIV infection among the street-based sex workers in central Bangladesh is higher than that of the sex workers in other parts of South Asia. The majority of brothel-based sex workers report having sex without using condoms with some of their clients.In central Bangladesh, 9.7 percent and in south-eastern Bangladesh 12 percent female sex workers have been found to be infected with syphilis. The high rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) confirms the low rate of condom use and the presence of other risky sexual behaviours that facilitate the spread of HIV infection.According to experts, the level of HIV infection among the IDUs poses a significant risk, as it can spread rapidly within the group and then, through their sexual partners and the latter's clients, among the general population.Another major concern is the significant number of IDUs who sell their blood professionally. Bangladesh relies on professional blood sellers to meet most of the blood transfusion needs of its people.Lack of proper knowledge on HIV/AIDS is another high risk factor. Only 17 percent of the most-at-risk groups have correct knowledge about prevention of the disease, but most people have misconceptions about it. A baseline survey of adolescents and young people (15-24 years) in 2005 found that only one out of three males in urban and one out of four in rural areas had correct knowledge on HIV/AIDS. Nearly 59 percent of married women and 42 percent of men of the age group, 15-54, years have no idea about how to avoid HIV.Therefore, it is imperative to give priority to  education, poverty alleviation, and regular media coverage for disseminating knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and to offer sex education to the adolescents and the young under an academic program, suggested Mohammad Shafiqur Rahman and Mohammad Lutfor Rahman, researchers at the Dhaka University Institute of Statistical Research and Training.Meanwhile, an initiative has been taken to develop a multi-sector response to HIV/AIDS. Strategic action plans of the NASP set forth specific guidelines on a range of HIV issues, including testing, care, blood safety, and preventive measures for youth, women, migrant workers, and commercial sex workers.The government also prepared a National Strategic Plan for combating HIV/AIDS for the period 2004-2010 under the guidance of the National AIDS Council and with the involvement and support of different stakeholders.Infectious Diseases Hospital at Mohakhali provides treatment to HIV/AIDS patients, who  can also get services at discount from the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and the Armed Forces Pathology. The government also has established voluntary counselling and testing centres in every district and upazila. As many as 380 NGOs, AIDS service organisations, and civil society bodies have been implementing various programs/projects across the country to contain scourge.Let all of us in society be conscious of the red ribbon and act accordingly.Billy I.

Religiosity and the Aids scare,A taboo no more?,,2008-08-04T00:00:00+06:00,"A taboo no more?NO, it's not the Communists that are instilling fear into leaders and populations across borders -- this time it's a transnational epidemic, on the brink of attack. While organisations in countries such as Brazil, South Africa and India have already implemented a counterattack on the disease, launching nation-wide ""red"" campaigns on HIV/Aids awareness, Bangladesh has certainly lagged behind in its effort to acknowledge the gravity of the Aids epidemic.Though we should of course laud the vow of the country's religious leaders to work to combat HIV/Aids (ref: ""Religious Leaders Vow to Work for Combating Aids/HIV"", The Daily Star, July 26), their efforts -- and those of the other organisations involved -- are still not enough.The regional meeting on ""The role of institutions and religious leaders to prevent aids,"" held in Satkhira last week, was a step in the right direction towards combating HIV/Aids -- but it comes a little too late.Topics such as HIV/Aids have always been taboo in Bangladesh because they beg questions of sexuality that our society is not ready to answer. And while society frets about propriety, the HIV-positive population suffers in silence, marginalised by governmental and religious institutions, which have done little to positively acknowledge their existence. According to a 2005 UN Aids study, (the most recent study to date), there were expected to be 11,000 people in Bangladesh living with HIV/Aids.The workshop, though it recognises the importance of combating HIV/Aids, skirted around the main issues at hand, and the structural injustices that lead to its spread. As the epidemic grows faster and faster in our neighbouring countries, we simply cannot afford to be less than blunt when speaking to our own.The population, perhaps,  does not need to be told that ""strict adherence to religious practice can help prevent the spread of HIV/Aids"" as stressed by the religious leaders at the workshop; what the population needs is a pragmatic approach to lead the country away from the epidemic's grasp.While  Islamic religion acknowledges and allows birth control, imams around the country refuse to do so.Most Islamic leaders have a tendency to view HIV/Aids as the result of  Western vice, attributing its onslaught to problems of morality; they fail to acknowledge the role of poverty, and ignorance in the spread of the epidemic as faith based organisations in other countries have recently done.It is no longer enough to simply inform people about HIV/Aids, as the workshop has promised to do; governmental and religious institutions must work together to teach people how to prevent the spread of the epidemic. And in the event that they cannot, other services must be established to support the infected population, such as counselling centres and increased access to medical treatment.The workshop acknowledged the involvement of religious leaders, but only insofar as their ability to ""motivate the people to adhere to religious practice."" Religion is pivotal in combating the epidemic in our country, as it influences much of our population; but it is important  to advocate methods which take note of the changing world.Instead of stressing Islam's theology of compassion, religious  leaders  tend to propagandise their own personal dogma, which has continued to stigmatise HIV/Aids and perpetuate negative stereotypes about its victims.It is of utmost importance for religious leaders to engage in the battle against HIV/Aids; but they must do so in the true spirit of Islam, one that is compassionate and non-judgmental. We must also remember that it is not just the duty of religious leaders, but every Muslim, to establish maslaha, or social well-being, and justice within society; and it is this that is considered in the Qur'an as the greater jihad for all Muslims.If we are indeed a Muslim population as we claim to be, then we must ask this of ourselves -- how could we have embraced Islam in our identity, without embracing Islam in our spirit?

AIDS should be seen as a disease which be treated properly,” she said.Earlier, speaking as the special guest at the lecture session UNFPA Country Representative Arthur Erken said Bangladesh is a low prevalence but high at-risk country.Awareness level among people, including students, is still very poor, he said, adding that proper information and knowledge are not given to the youths, though they are at high at-risk.Dhaka University Vice Chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique, Pro-VC Prof Harun-or-Rashid and Dr Salil Panakadan, country director of UNAIDS, also spoke at the session.After the programme, a film festival on AIDS was also organised at the same venue.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'young', 'bangladesh', 'vulnerability', 'aids', 'hiv', 'fund', 'control', 'dr', 'nafis', 'special', 'sadik', 'vital', 'fight', 'youths', 'efficient']","Special Envoy to the UN Secretary General for HIV/AIDS Dr Nafis Sadik yesterday said funds to combat HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh is increasing but the efficient use of that fund is important.

Several hundred thousand people  infected during the explosive start of epidemics are becoming ill and undergoing treatment. The treatment of infections becomes a great burden for the country concerned, because HIV/AIDS requires long-term and effective medical care, periodical hospital-based care and trained manpower to provide comprehensive healthcare services. For countries where resources are scarce, easy access to treatment and care remain very difficult and prohibitive for many PLWHAs. (People Living with HIV/AIDS)Globally, more or less 40 million people  are infected with HIV/AIDS, Every day 14,000 people are getting infected and 6,000 are young men and women; approximately 95% live in severely resource-constrained settings. In 2005, there were 4.9 million new infections.Sometimes poverty facilitates the spread of HIV/AIDS, but equally HIV/AIDS affects  poverty. Generalizing HIV/AIDS into a problem of poverty will paralyse an effective and specific response to it.

AIDS: Epidemic bell ringing,HIV has turned into a concentrated epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs).,,2007-10-28T00:00:00+06:00,"HIV has turned into a concentrated epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs).The battle against AIDS has taken in many directions over the last three decades. HIV infection continues to grow rapidly among high risk groups and there is concerning evidence of increasing new HIV infection rate despite prevalence rate said to remain low.Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries in the Asia-Pacific region where HIV/AIDS infections are rising. It was revealed at the recent 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP8) in Colombo 2007. This report gives us real cause for concern.Experts are predicting that the AIDS pandemic could be set to explode in the country. They identified political instability, human trafficking into prostitution, stigmatisation of those infected, conservative social attitudes and most importantly intravenous drug use as the key obstacles in the fight against the spread of HIV and make our people more vulnerable to HIV infection.“In our country, HIV has turned into a concentrated epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs). Spreading of HIV at a rate of 5 per cent among the high-risk groups is considered as concentrated epidemic. In 2000 the rate of HIV infection among IDUs was 1.4 per cent, in 2004 it raised to 4.9 per cent and in 2006 it reached to7.1 percent”, said Dr Yasmin Jahan, a consultant of the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP).“Ironically the IDUs are the very people who supply blood for transfusions, thus fuelling the risk of spread to the generalised population. The trend illustrates a risky growth which needs strong intervention without undue prolongation,"" she added.“All sorts of high risk behaviour such as sharing of needles and syringes, resorting to drug use through injection, multiple sex partners and having commercial sex are prevalent among IDUs and make them the most vulnerable to spread infection. Current intervention programmes for the IDUs provided by different organisations can rehabilitate only a few portion of the 4.6 million IDUs in the country. This programme should be boost up immediately”, Dr Yasmin pointed out.According to the government statistics, a cumulative total of 874 cases of HIV/AIDS has been confirmed and reported as of 31st December 2006. A total of 240 AIDS cases were detected so far of which 109 had already died. Government agencies estimate that nearly 7,500 people are infected by HIV/AIDS. However, World Bank figures that nearly 12,000 people are affected by HIV in Bangladesh, with around 700 deaths in the past year.A government survey found that out of 216 new HIV positive cases identified in 2006, unemployed people were on top of the list at 39.35 per cent followed by housewives at 21.29 per cent and businessmen at 10.18 per cent. The data shows that unemployment is also causing spread of HIV/AIDS.""All the statistics regarding HIV are based on high risk population. Nobody knows the actual condition of HIV infection among general population, as we have no data. The continued focus on high-risk groups has created a false sense of security and complacency in the general population including policy makers.Bangladesh has many suspected unreported cases because of social stigma in both rural and urban communities. Many people living with HIV/AIDS are unwilling to be tested and even though there are private and public laboratories carrying out HIV testing. Among the high-risk groups HIV testing is also challenging as they have their right to give consent and nothing should not be done against their will to protect their right.The daunting epidemic burden and momentum, however may be masked by the large population leading to low reported prevalence, which has resulted in considerable complications among government and developmental stakeholders. This is a key challenge fighting HIV/AIDS”, expressed Dr Mozammel Hoque, an HIV adviser of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC).“Another major concern in the region, in the context of HIV/AIDS, is the large scale of movement of people within and across national borders and trafficking of women and children. Bangladesh has been reported as one of the top countries having the highest incidences of trafficked women who are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. This sector remains relatively under focused and there is no strong measure to curb trafficking.Many countries require people to get mandatory testing for HIV infection before travelling but for those returning from countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence have no arrangement for voluntary counseling which is badly required in present situation. There is evidence of high rates of HIV transmission to wives from their husbands after their return from abroad”, he added.Lack of proper knowledge and risky sexual behaviour on HIV/AIDS facilitates the deadly virus to spread at an alarming rate. According to the existing data on knowledge and behaviour, only 17 per cent of the most-at-risk populations have correct knowledge about prevention and most people misconceptions on HIV/AIDS.A survey among adolescents and young people (15-24 years) in 2005 revealed that only one out of three males in urban and one out of four in rural areas had correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Nearly 59 per cent of married women and 42 per cent of men of age 15-54 group have no idea as how to avoid HIV.Statistics on commercial sex workers also shows that although these women have every intention of using condom and understand the risk of not protecting themselves. In most cases it was found that their clients refused to use condoms.Rakhi, (not a real name) a sex worker from a city suburb says, “Most of my clients do not enjoy sex with a condom. Since they are buying sex, they rule the business”.Many experts point out that a decade ago, India had almost the same low level status but it now has an uncontrollable epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The Indian government was initially in denial voice regarding the fact that India could have so many people living with HIV/AIDS.Experts doubt that Bangladesh may not remain as low prevalent country for long. We should get prepared to  take action now.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'population', 'sex', 'epidemic', 'risk', 'aids', 'bell', 'spread', 'rate', 'ringing', 'hiv', 'idus', 'infection', 'cent']","HIV infection continues to grow rapidly among high risk groups and there is concerning evidence of increasing new HIV infection rate despite prevalence rate said to remain low.

Around 95 percent of the people with HIV/AIDS live in developing nations.Bangladesh has been recognised as one of the five countries in Asia, where HIV/AIDS infections are increasing according to 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP8) 2007 in Colombo.Bangladesh is a country of 150 million. Although Bangladesh is a low prevalence country for HIV/AIDS, all the factors that may allow rapid spread of infection leading to an epidemic are present here. These factors include poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, proximity, malnutrition, unemployment, slum housing, family fragility, physical and sexual abuse, high prevalence of STIs, sharing injecting equipment, high-risk behaviour, lack of awareness and knowledge (lack of proper communication strategy), very mobile populations, human trafficking into prostitution, stigmatisation of those infected, conservative social attitudes, and being surrounded by countries that have a higher prevalence.Sharing injecting equipment increases the HIV risk. In addition increased number of migrant workers (there is evidence of HIV transmission to wives from their husbands after their return from abroad), unsafe practice in health service, unsafe sex practice, low lack of voluntary blood donors and dependence on professional blood sellers further increase the risk.Our current situationAccording to government statistics, a cumulative total of 874 cases of HIV/AIDS had been confirmed and reported as of 31st December 2006. A total of 240 AIDS cases were detected so far of which 109 had already died.A government survey found that out of 216 new HIV positive cases identified in 2006, unemployed people were on top of the list at 39.35 per cent followed by housewives at 21.29 per cent and businessmen at 10.18 per cent.Injecting drug users (IDU) in Dhaka are at high risk of HIV/AIDS, according to new study by ICDDR,B.  HIV prevalence in Dhaka has dramatically risen to 7 percent from 1.7 percent in last six years. Sharing of injection equipment is common in most IDU surveyed. The IDU are not isolated as they have sex partners, both commercial and non-commercial, they rarely use condoms and some sell blood. IDU are also mobile traveling from one city to another and sharing injection equipment in different cities. Mobility is major factor that increases the risk of acquiring and spreading HIV infection among the non-drug users.The adolescent and youth are also vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. A survey among adolescents and young people (15-24 years) in 2005 revealed that only one out of 3 males in urban and 1 out of 4 in rural areas had correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Nearly 59 per cent of married women and 42 per cent of men of 15-54 age group have no knowledge as how to avoid HIV.Future prioritiesMandatory testing for HIV infection is common in many countries before traveling and those returning from countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Bangladesh should follow these norms. To prevent a major epidemic, Bangladesh needs to address HIV/AIDS using a multi-pronged strategy: first, formulating the national HIV/AIDS communication strategy; secondly, concentrating on groups most vulnerable to the infection; thirdly, working with the general population (community mobilisation and community supports); and fourthly, care and support to those already infected and affected by HIV/AIDS have to be provided (voluntary counseling). Dissemination and advocacy can also play a big role.We need to change our society through public policy research, public awareness, increased funding, and community education. Above all Bangladesh should immediately translate its HIV/AIDS policies into action to benefit the people and for that reason we need strong and an effective leadership. Otherwise HIV/AIDS will destroy the economic growth of the country.

Healthcare companies have been forced to buy or swap assets to bolster growing areas of their businesses and shore up their defences as generic versions of previously patented medicines are released in the market.Sales of Advair, an asthma treatment and a bestseller for GSK, are expected to decline following the introduction of a generic version in the US.In the first nine months of the year, GSK reported that sales of Advair fell 19 percent to £1.2 billion, whereas sales of HIV treatments rose 56 percent to £1.6 billion.The company had considered spinning off its 80 percent stake in ViiV Healthcare through a flotation that could have valued the business at £18 billion. However, it decided to hang on to the operation in May.GSK said it would make an upfront payment of $317 million to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb's late stage HIV drugs, with a further $518 million dependent on sales and royalties.

Worldwide, deaths from HIV/AIDS declined at a rate of 1.5% between 2000 and 2013, while tuberculosis declined at a rate of 3.7% over the same period. In contrast to global trends, the study further reveals that deaths from HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh increased by a rate of 1.9% between 2000 and 2013. Deaths from TB and malaria have fallen at a faster rate than the global average at 6.7% (compared to 3.7% globally) and 11.1% (compared to 3.1% globally), respectively, between 2000 and 2013.Dr. Aliya Naheed, Associate Scientist with icddr,b’s Centre for Equity and Health Systems said, “Bangladesh has worked hard to improve the diagnosis and treatment of TB. We’ve also invested in malaria control efforts, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria provided important support for our national malaria program since 2007. Now we need to prioritise our growing challenge with HIV/AIDS”.The researchers also found that there were a total of 204 TB cases per 100,000 people in Bangladesh in 2013, and 193 new cases of TB per 100,000 were diagnosed that year. By comparison, there were 7 cases of HIV/AIDS per 100,000 in Bangladesh in 2013, and less than 1 new infection per 100,000 for that year.Furthermore, new cases of HIV/AIDS and deaths from the disease primarily occurred in males. In 2013, there were 390 deaths from HIV/AIDS in males compared to 181 in females. TB deaths and new infections in Bangladesh were also largely concentrated in males; total TB deaths last year involved 12,257 males compared to 3,288 females. Similarly, new cases and deaths from HIV and tuberculosis are more common in males at the global level. The study also assessed trends in annual malaria cases and deaths throughout the world. From 2000 to 2013, Bangladesh had a large decline in malaria deaths, dropping from 114 in 2000 to 32 in 2013.The Millennium Declaration in 2000 brought special global attention to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria through the formulation of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6.

The analysis revealed substantial evidence that criminalisation impedes access to services and support for sex workers, even though an explicit goal of “end demand” approaches is to increase access.The authors aimed to longitudinally evaluate the impact of the PCEPA on sex workers' access to HIV care, primary care and community-led and sex worker-led services in Vancouver, Canada.There was no evidence of increased access to HIV-specific services among sex workers living with HIV following implementation of the new laws. The post-policy period was also correlated with significantly reduced odds of accessing health services when needed.The study concluded that “end demand” approaches may, in fact, exacerbate barriers to healthcare and community-led services.French “end demand” law had a variety of negative consequencesA second study dealt with a 2016 French law criminalising sex workers’ clients. Opponents of the law cite the risk of increased vulnerability among sex workers and exposure to stigma and violence, which hinders their access to health and legal services and increases risks of exploitation in the sex industry.Based on these arguments, Médecins du Monde (Doctors of the World) fielded a survey aimed at evaluating the impact of the law on sex workers' health, rights and well-being.An analysis presented by Hélène Lebail, of CNRS – Sciences Po, Centre de Recherches Internationales, showed that the law’s most direct effect has been an acute increase in the socio-economic vulnerability of sex workers, including: an increase in experienced violence; degrading working conditions; and negative health consequences.The authors also found a decrease in condom use and increased difficulty for sex workers to negotiate safe-sex practices after the law took effect. Additionally, HIV-positive sex workers faced difficulty accessing services.While it is still too early to evaluate the impact in terms of HIV infections, the research pointed to an increase in some sexually transmitted infections, notably of syphilis, among sex workers in France. The authors concluded that policy makers should consider these findings when designing new laws to mitigate harmful health effects.","['law', 'workers', 'sex', 'access', 'work', 'end', 'services', 'demand', 'hiv', 'laws', 'increase']","Research suggests that “end demand” laws are reducing demand for HIV services, according to panellists sharing the effectiveness of “end demand” policies at a press conference that featured scientific abstracts and input from advocates.

Leveraging HIV/AIDS and NCDs for strengthened chronic care systems,Photo: Tanvir Ahmed / Driknews,,2011-12-01T00:00:00+06:00,"Photo: Tanvir Ahmed / DriknewsEven though HIV/AIDS remains the main cause of adult death in sub-Saharan countries, concentrated epidemic is being observed in Asian countries among the most at risk people like injected drug users. The burden of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCD) in such countries is also high and growing rapidly. This phenomenon is not something new, however, regrettably, most developing countries face the new challenges of NCD at the same time as the challenges of communicable diseases and threats to maternal and child health.This burden of two kinds of diseases -- both needing constant care -- is putting extra pressure on the health care system of these countries, which are already having hard time in providing the integrated and coordinated services required to address chronic care. Therefore, very few persons living with NCDs and HIV in resource-limited settings have access to appropriate health services, leading to deferred diagnosis and unnecessary death and disability.Global guidelines and conceptual frameworks for NCD programmes are available for integrated and unified activities. However, very few developing countries have national NCD programmes providing nationwide activities for NCD prevention, care, and treatment services. Because of this, the health systems in resource-limited settings are hardly able to deliver continuous services of any kind and typically provide only short-term care for acute symptoms or problems. Even though HIV and NCD are thought of as quite different challenges, both these diseases need constant care systems.Fortunately, due to the availability of global funds in the health systems throughout the developing countries, tools and approaches needed to support continuous care in the local context have been developed. These models and approaches can be used for tackling NCDs as well. However, it goes without saying that the lessons of HIV care will not be always suitable for all NCD programmes or in all contexts. However, rather than ""reinventing the wheel,"" resource poor countries may be able jump-start NCD programmes by adapting locally owned and locally validated approaches initially developed to support HIV prevention, care, and treatment services.One of the success stories of HIV programmes is leading to a remarkable expansion of HIV treatment, reaching 6.6 million people compared with half a million 10 years ago. This is a lesson that the NCD programmes can learn. At a global, or ""upstream,"" level, NCD experts have developed multi-sectoral partnerships inclusive of civil society and achieved a high-visibility platform in the United Nations meeting. But the key question is the same for both, should there be a global fund for NCD or should advocates press instead for NCD services to be included in primary health care programmes and for efforts to strengthen broader health systems?In both the cases, key lessons from HIV programmes include the influence of unambiguous conscription targets to leverage resources and promote accountability; the value of engaging civil society and recipients of services to improve programme quality and adequacy; the need for novel financing schemes; the importance of leveraging the private sector; the multiple challenges of primary prevention; the importance of access to diagnosis, care, and treatment; and the power of a rights-based framework.On the other hand the ""downstream"" resources include key tools, and on the ground strategies and systems developed to support the implementation of HIV programmes that could be tailored to support programmes and services for NCD. However, we have to keep in our mind that the magnitude of NCDs is much higher than HIV in many countries, therefore NCDs need more decentralised activities embedded at community and primary care levels.One way of leveraging these two challenges of the decade is to compile a ""package of care"" for each level of the health system, including features like the use of standardised step-by-step diagnosis, care, and treatment protocols; the promotion of simplified point-of-service diagnostic testing; the use of simple and powerful indicators for monitoring and evaluation; and the development of enrollment targets at facility, locality and national levels. Paradigms of systems used by HIV programmes that could be stretched or ""cloned"" for use in NCD initiatives include decentralised community-based diagnostic testing; appointment and defaulter tracking systems; laboratory networks and referral systems; task-shifting and task-sharing approaches; clinical mentoring and supportive supervision; and the systematic use of peer educators. However, not all of these will be applicable to every NCD programme or in every context, but many valuable, practical, contextually appropriate and easily adapted resources could be used to jump-start service delivery.The most important aspect of this leveraging issue is that there are important differences between HIV and NCD that may limit the relevance of some of these resources. Both diabetes and HIV are diagnosed via laboratory testing and treated at some stages with daily medications; both require regular clinical and laboratory monitoring and support for adherence and behaviour change. In contrast, some cardiovascular diseases and cancers may be considerably harder to diagnose and treat at the health centre and community levels. Issues of stigma may shape programmes for HIV and mental health more than those designed for other NCDs. If significantly more resources become available, it might not be difficult to implement large-scale NCD programmes of any kind.It does not matter if the NCD initiatives are organised as ""vertical"" disease-specific or ""horizontal"" health systems-strengthening programmes, or as an amalgam. Addressing the burden of NCD in developing countries like Bangladesh requires an intensive, well-resourced multi-sectoral effort. And overlooking the potential of local HIV programmes to catalyse NCD service delivery would be a mistake. Leveraging the experience of HIV prevention, care, and treatment initiatives may take different forms. In some contexts, amalgamation of services for all chronic diseases -- HIV and NCD -- would be the best approach. In others, programmes might not get integrated at the point of service but may draw upon similar systems, from monitoring and evaluation to procurement. The take home message is that strengthening health systems to deliver continuous care is likely to enhance the performance of both HIV and NCD programmes, and should be top priority.The writers work at Eminence, Centre for Health Care and Development Intelligence.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'ncds', 'countries', 'strengthened', 'programmes', 'leveraging', 'systems', 'chronic', 'health', 'services', 'treatment', 'diseases', 'hiv', 'ncd', 'care']","Global guidelines and conceptual frameworks for NCD programmes are available for integrated and unified activities.

No room for complacency,AIDS is a relentless enemy. Photo: Noor Alam/ DrikNews,,2009-11-30T23:00:00+07:00,"AIDS is a relentless enemy. Photo: Noor Alam/ DrikNewsACCORDING to new data in Epidemic Update published by UNAIDS and WHO very recently, HIV infections have decreased by 17% over the past eight years. In East Asia, HIV infections declined by nearly 25% and in South and South East Asia by 10% in the same time period. The number of AIDS-related deaths has declined by over 10% over the past five years as more people gained to access to life saving treatment. UNAIDS and WHO estimate that since the availability of effective treatment in 1996, some 2.9 million lives have been saved.The latest epidemiological data indicate that globally the spread of HIV appears to have peaked in 1996, when 3.5 million [3.2 million3.8 million] new HIV infections occurred. In 2008, the estimated number of new HIV infections was approximately 30% lower than at the epidemic's peak 12 years earlier. Consistent with the long interval between HIV Sero-conversion and symptomatic disease, annual HIV-related mortality appears to have peaked in 2004, when 2.2 million [1.9 million2.6 million] deaths occurred. The estimated number of AIDS related deaths in 2008 is roughly 10% lower than in 2004.However, in some countries there are signs that new HIV infections are rising again. HIV prevalence is still increasing in some parts of our region, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan. Bangladesh has transitioned from a low-level epidemic to a concentrated epidemic, with especially elevated rates among injecting drug users (Azim et al., 2008). The overwhelming majority of people with HIV, some 95% of the global total, live in the developing world. The proportion is set to grow even further as infection rates continue to rise in countries where poverty, poor health care systems and limited resources for prevention and care fuel the spread of the virus. There is increased evidence of risk among key populations. While high HIV prevalence has long been documented among sex workers in diverse countries worldwide, evidence was extremely limited regarding the contribution of men who have sex with men and injecting drug users to epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.What is HIV/AIDSHIV stands for: Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV is a virus that cannot grow or reproduce on its own, it need to infect the cells of a living organism in order to replicate. The human immune system usually finds and kills viruses, but HIV attacks the immune system itself. As HIV progressively damages these cells, the body becomes more vulnerable to infections, which it will have difficulty in fighting off.AIDS stands for: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is a medical condition. A person is diagnosed with AIDS when his/her immune system is too weak to fight off infections. It takes around ten years on average for someone with HIV to develop AIDS. However, this average is based on the person with HIV having a reasonable diet, and someone who is malnourished may well progress from HIV to AIDS more rapidly. Since AIDS was first identified in the early 1980s, an estimated 33.4 people have been attacked by HIV/AIDS.A person first develops an AIDS-related condition or symptom, called an ""opportunistic infection."" AIDS can be diagnosed when the number of immune system cells (CD4 cells) in the blood of an HIV positive person drops below a certain level. It is important to remember that a person who has HIV can pass on the virus immediately after becoming infected, even if he/she feels healthy. The only way to know for certain if someone is infected with HIV is for them to be tested.How is HIV passed onHIV is found in the blood and the sexual fluids of an infected person, and in the breast milk of an infected woman. There are various ways a person can become infected with HIV:-Unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person;-Contact with an infected person's blood;-Use of infected blood products: Many people in the past have been infected with HIV by the use of blood transfusions and blood products which were contaminated with the virus;-Injecting drugs: HIV can be passed on when injecting equipment that has been used by an infected person is then used by someone else.-From mother to child: HIV can be transmitted from an infected woman to her baby during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding.Certain groups of people, such as injecting drug users, sex workers, prisoners, and men who have sex with men have been particularly affected by HIV. However, HIV can infect anybody, and everyone needs to know how they can and can't become infected with HIV.Minimising measuresMinimising the impact of HIV will require massive response at the national and international levels:-People need to challenge the myths and misconceptions about human sexuality that translate into dangerous sexual practices;-Legislation is needed to reduce prejudice felt by HIV+ people around the world and the discrimination that prevents people from ""coming out"" as being HIV positive;-HIV prevention initiatives need to be increased, people across the world need to be made aware of the dangers, the risks, and the ways they can protect themselves;-Condom promotion and supply need to be increased;-Appropriate sexual health education must be provided to young people before they reach an age where they become sexually active;-Medication and support need to be provided to people who are already HIV+, so that they can live longer and more productive lives.-Support and care must be provided for those children who have been orphaned by AIDS.AIDS out of IsolationOne of the significant findings of the report is that the impact of the AIDS response is high where HIV prevention and treatment programs have been integrated with other health and social welfare services. Asia's epidemic has long been concentrated in specific populations, namely injecting drug users, sex workers and their clients, and men who have sex with men. However, the epidemic in many parts of Asia is steadily expanding into lower-risk populations through transmission to the sexual partners of those most at risk. In China, where the epidemic was previously driven by transmission during injecting drug use, heterosexual transmission has become the predominant mode of HIV transmission (Wang et al., 2009).Several countries have taken steps to scale up medical male circumcision for HIV prevention, including Botswana, Kenya and Namibia (Forum for Collaborative HIV Research, 2009). Botswana is integrating male circumcision into its national surgery framework, with the aim of reaching 80% of males aged 049 by 2013 (Forum for Collaborative Research, 2009). As of March 2009, Swaziland had drafted a formal male circumcision policy (Mngadi et al., 2009). A recent analysis determined that the scale-up of adult male circumcision in 14 African countries would require considerable funding (an estimated $ 919 million over five years) and substantial investments in human resources development, but that scale-up would save costs in the long run by altering the trajectory of national epidemics (Auvert et al., 2008).    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Policy measuresTo be successful, a comprehensive HIV prevention program needs strong political leadership. This means politicians and leaders in all sectors must speak out openly about AIDS and not shy away from difficult issues like sex, sexuality and drug use.An effective response requires strategic planning based on good quality science and surveillance, as well as consideration of local society and culture. All sectors of the population should be actively involved in the response, including employers, religious groups, non-governmental organisations and HIV-positive people. Many of the world's most successful HIV prevention efforts have been led by the affected communities themselves.HIV epidemics thrive on stigma and discrimination related to people living with the virus and to marginalised groups such as sex workers. Their spread is also fueled by gender inequality, which restricts what women can do to protect themselves from infection. Protecting and promoting human rights should be an essential part of any comprehensive HIV prevention strategy. This includes legislating against the many forms of stigma and discrimination that increase vulnerability.Concluding message""International and national investment in HIV treatment scale-up have yielded concrete and measurable results,” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director General of WHO. “We cannot let this momentum wane. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, and save many more lives."" Nicholas Biswas is a Researcher and Development Activist.

Urgent steps needed to tackle AIDS,,,2007-12-02T00:00:00+06:00,"While global HIV prevalence--the percentage of people living with HIV--has levelled off, the number of new infections has risen in the country. Recently Bangladesh has been reported as one of the five countries in the Asia-Pacific region where HIV/AIDS infections are rising.HIV in high-risk groupsThere is concerning proof that HIV infection continues to increase rapidly among the high-risk groups specially injecting drug users (IDUs). And nobody knows the actual figure of HIV infection in general population as we have no survey on them. The continued focus on high-risk groups has created a false sense of security and complacency in the general population including policy makers.HIV has already turned into a concentrated epidemic (spread at a rate of 5 percent or more) among IDUs [7 percent]. The country has entered near to the epidemic more or less but is still considered as low prevalence states according to current statistics.This statistical jargon of ‘low prevalence’ does not have much meaning particularly when viewed against large absolute numbers in some of the neighbouring countries of the region. The daunting epidemic burden and momentum however may be masked by the large population leading to low reported prevalence.So it is imperative for the country to depict the actual portrait of the country with a stronger empirical data and contextualise the problems faced in regard to HIV/AIDS and view them in correct perspective.In order to keep the prevalence low, Bangladesh needs a strong and effective policy through legal frameworks, coordination and strong HIV prevention, better treatment and care. Yet much more remains to be done to achieve the goal of universal access.Global coverage of many of the key interventions against HIV/AIDS remains low, and the growth in the number of new infections and people in need of treatment continues to outpace the capacity of health services to respond.Our financial resources also fall short of what will be needed to achieve universal access, and the sustained political commitment needed to tackle AIDS over the long term is still lacking in the country.Meeting the needs of affected communities will require a comprehensive response that addresses both prevention and treatment simultaneously.Working towards universal access by 2010 to achieve standard in HIV prevention, treatment, care and support is a very ambitious challenge. AIDS programmes will have to be equitable, accessible, affordable, comprehensive and sustainable.In the efforts to achieve universal access, country must face huge challenges. Stigma and discrimination continue to impede prevention and treatment efforts. Among the most important priorities is the strengthening of health services so that they are able to provide a comprehensive range of HIV/AIDS services to all those who need them.Somewhere HIV prevention programmes are not reaching the people most at risk of infection, such as young people, women and girls, men who have sex with men, sex workers and their clients, injecting drug users, and ethnic and cultural minorities. Current HIV prevention works but needs to be focused and sustained.HIV testing and counselingOver the past 20 years, voluntary counselling and testing programmes (VCT) have helped millions of people learn their HIV status, yet a very few people in high risk groups of our country know that they are infected.Efforts are urgently needed to increase the provision of HIV testing through a wider range of effective and safe options. HIV testing is a critical entry point to life-sustaining healthcare services for people living with HIV/AIDS and service delivery models need to be expanded to testing in antenatal care, sexually transmitted infection clinics, in-patient wards as well as free-standing client-initiated testing centres.Treatment and careAfter the first detection of HIV positive case in the country in 1989, the treatment and care are still inadequate. An infected person faces many inequities and discrimination in treatment and care.These are the very people who keep themselves away from seeking treatment for stigma and thus fuelling the infection to the general population.We need to ensure that the infection does not spread from this source, in order to stop the internal transmission. The infected persons should be educated on how to take care of himself/herself. But these people unfortunately are not getting any treatment or cannot buy costly antiretroviral (ARV) drugs; sometimes do not get even proper food or a place to stay. We need to give urgent attention to this matter.In the early years of AIDS when it was seen as ‘gay disease’, Africa failed to gain attention of the global health agenda that west did. They recgnised when it took more lives than any other disease.Failure of timely recognition of African episodes of AIDS delayed the response of the countries to crisis, making it the most AIDS-burden region in the world.Let us not leave ourselves open to a similar fate. It is the high time to rethink seriously. Action must not only be increased dramatically, but must also be strategic, focused and sustainable.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'low', 'hivaids', 'need', 'urgent', 'aids', 'testing', 'steps', 'treatment', 'country', 'needed', 'tackle', 'hiv', 'care', 'infection']","HIV in high-risk groupsThere is concerning proof that HIV infection continues to increase rapidly among the high-risk groups specially injecting drug users (IDUs).

At 2.5 million, the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 percent lower than in 2001.Deaths from AIDS fell to 1.7 million in 2011, down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005 and from 1.8 million in 2010.Sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected region with almost one in every 20 adults infected, nearly 25 times the rate in Asia, there are also almost 5 million people with HIV in South, South-East and East Asia combined.""Although AIDS remains one of the world's most serious health challenges, global solidarity in the AIDS response during the past decade continues to generate extraordinary health gains,"" the report said.It said this was due to ""historic success"" in bringing HIV programs to scale, combined with the emergence of new combination drugs to prevent people from becoming HIV infected and from dying from AIDS.Since 1995, AIDS drug treatment - known as antiretroviral therapy - has saved 14 million life-years in poorer countries, including 9 million in sub-Saharan Africa, the report said.Some 8 million people were being treated with AIDS drugs by the end of 2011, a 20-fold increase since 2003. The UN has set a target to raise that to 15 million people by 2015.Scientific studies published in recent years have shown that getting timely treatment to those with HIV can also cut the number of people who become newly infected with the virus.UNAIDS said the sharpest declines in new HIV infections since 2001 were in the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa - where new infections were down 25 percent in a decade.Despite this, sub-Saharan Africa still accounted for 71 percent of people newly infected in 2011, underscoring the need to boost HIV prevention efforts in the region, UNAIDS said.HIV trends are a concern in other regions also, it said.Since 2001, the number of new HIV infections in the Middle East and North Africa was up more than 35 percent from 27,000 to 37,000, it said, and evidence suggests HIV infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia began increasing in the late 2000s after being relatively stable for several years.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['infections', 'report', 'infected', 'end', 'million', 'aids', 'number', '2011', 'africa', 'hiv', 'sight']","An aim to eventually end the worldwide AIDS epidemic is not ""merely visionary"" but ""entirely feasible"", the report said.

Afghanistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and Maldives are other Asian countries with no HIV cases up to June, 1988. Sounding a note of caution, the Panos said that the greatest risk to Bangladesh was from ""visiting sailors and soldiers."" Along with these, some of the country's 40 million expatriate workers are seen as another risk factor today.The other day (27 May) there was a case report in a section of the press (BSS/The Independent) that a Bangladeshi worker was affected by HIV through unsafe blood transfusion in Malaysia and in non leading a secluded life in the country almost without any family and social cooperation. Dirty syringes are also described as a problem, since they also transmit other diseases like Hepatitis B. Sex is seen as the least important factor in Bangladesh because of our moral, spiritual and other attitudes. But with the passage of time there have, however, been some changes in attitudes and values in our country also. The number of reported HIV cases in Bangladesh till December last year was 1,207, while the number of AIDS cases was 365, according to official estimates. The number of deaths from AIDS in the country is 123 so far, while there are an estimated 1,500 HIV cases, according to official sources. Unofficial estimates would, however, put such figures much higher. What has been haunting those working in the field is that in a conservative Muslim majority country nearly 1,500 HIV positive cases have been reported, while there were none two decades ago. WHO has been providing technical and logistical support to Bangladesh to scale-up prevention, care, treatment and support to the people living with HIV/AIDS. About 2.5 million people have been afflicted with HIV in India, 339,000 in Myanmar, 193,000 in Indonesia, 70,000 in Nepal, and 541,000 in Thailand. Worldwide, over 5,700 persons die from the killer disease every day, mostly because of inadequate access to HIV prevention and treatment services. About 60 million people have been infected, and AIDS has already claimed more than 25 million lives.  Of the estimated 33.2 million people with HIV in the world in 2007, about 7.2 million live in the South-East Asia region, which indeed is alarming. The awareness of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh still remains quite low. ""Only 19 percent of married women and 33 percent of married men had heard of AIDS,"" revealed a survey conducted about five years ago. WHO considers creating awareness on HIV/AIDS as a priority intervention at school level.Dr. Hanif Uddin, Deputy Programme Manager, National AIDS/STD Programme was of the opinion that today's scenario regarding awareness in the country's married men and women would be between 50-60 percent. A survey is being conducted on the prevailing situation.According to Dr. Kamruzzaman Biswas, National Programme Officer, WHO: ""Family life education in Bangladesh is still in its infancy. As a first step, the WHO is supporting the National STD/AIDS Programme to orientate teachers on HIV/AIDS.""Dr. Kamruzzaman said: ""The majority of parents in Bangladesh are not at ease talking about sexuality and HIV/AIDS with their children. At the same time, teachers still do not feel comfortable about talking on these issues.But, in reality, students have a lot of questions in their minds related to the physiological and emotional changes during adolescence. They can get wrong information from their friends if parents and teachers fail. As education about HIV/AIDS has not gained the desired momentum through the formal education system, WHO is supporting awareness programmes for students.""Blood safety is one of the priority issues for prevention of HIV/AIDS, especially in Bangladesh, as professional donors still remain the major source of blood supply.Meanwhile, Bangladesh, with WHO, has taken up a project  to prevent HIV infection in young people aged 15-24 . The activities covered in the proposal include providing HIV prevention information to young people through mass media, life skills education through youth organisations and clubs, integration of HIV prevention into secondary schools and higher secondary curriculum, and making health services more youth friendly.Dr. Kamruzzaman said: ""A social marketing programme for condoms targeted to young people will be introduced in 64 districts. Advocacy and sensitisation programmes will target religious and community leaders, parents, and policy makers. The proposal will also cover the much-needed research to generate the strategic information that is required to respond to the epidemic.""As there is no cure for AIDS, it is hoped that the government will take all necessary steps to create awareness among the people at all levels so that all the people become familiar with the killer disease.Bangladesh, with its limited resources, cannot provide all the facilities required for AIDS patients. Today, a variety of treatments that can delay the progression of the disease for many years are available, and they can improve the quality of life of those who have developed symptoms. The government should do its best to make such facilities available to those who need them.

Ignorance, stigma, political inaction, indifference and denial all contributed to millions of deaths.""Mobility and migration are adding further difficulties in the management of the disaster.""The HIV epidemic can spell disaster for both sending and receiving communities, as well as communities along transit routes,"" said the report.For instance, in countries with relatively low HIV prevalence, such as the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan, a larger proportion of returning migrants had the disease compared to the general populations.About 35 percent of all documented HIV cases in the Philippines were among returning workers who have worked overseas, while in 2006, they made up 42 percent of new HIV cases, the report noted.The World Health Organisation said this month that the number of people in developing countries receiving antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV had risen sevenfold in the past three years to nearly three million by 2007.But a WHO co-authored report found that much more needed to be done: despite the increase, an estimated 6.7 million people in need of anti-retrovirals were still unable to access medicines, out of a total of 9.7 million.The report, produced in conjunction with UNAIDS and Unicef, said that the rise was due to the increased availability of drugs, in part due to price cuts, but also to delivery systems better adapted to specific country needs.But there was also increased demand for the treatment, as the number of people tested and diagnosed with HIV climbed, the WHO noted.Earlier this year, a joint UN study found that more than two million children worldwide were living with the HIV virus in 2007, most of whom were infected before they were born.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['society', 'epidemic', 'africa', 'report', 'red', 'aids', 'million', 'disaster', 'cases', 'cross', 'hiv', 'living']","Africa's AIDS epidemic is so severe that it should be classed as a disaster comparable to floods or famine, the Red Cross said Thursday.

Big blow for Aids battle,Joep Lange,,2014-07-20T00:01:46+06:00,"Joep LangeJoep Lange, the virologist, who was killed in the Malaysian Airlines crash in eastern Ukraine aged 59, was a pioneer in the field of HIV/Aids since the days when the epidemic was first identified in the early 1980s; in recent years he was at the forefront of the campaign to improve access to anti-retroviral drugs in poor countries.Lange was instrumental in the development of techniques of clinical care of HIV-infected patients from as early as 1982, when the disease, then spreading rapidly among gay men, did not even have a name. In the later 1980s, as a researcher at Amsterdam University Hospital, Lange led pioneering research into the risk of a carrier of HIV developing full-blown Aids, establishing that the risk is determined by the level of a protein known as “P24” in a carrier's blood.He went on to lead early tests on the drug Retrovir, an antiretroviral which proved to be the first breakthrough in Aids therapy, significantly reducing the replication of HIV in patients. In a pilot study 18 Dutch HIV-positive men were given the drug; in 13 of them the count of antibodies against the virus (an indication of its presence) was reduced significantly by the treatment. Lange went on to lead a joint programme, involving research bodies in London, Copenhagen, Sydney and Amsterdam, which confirmed these early findings. Later he led research on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.Partly due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy in richer countries, Aids is now largely a disease of the poor. More than 95 per cent of infections occur in developing countries. As head of Clinical Research and Drug Development at the Global Programme on Aids of the World Health Organisation in the 1990s, then as president of the International Aids Society from 2002 to 2004, and finally as founder chairman of the non-profit PharmAccess Foundation until his death, Lange criss-crossed the world speaking at conferences, advising local health workers and launching campaigns to provide affordable access to effective drug therapy in poorer countries: “If we can get cold Coca-Cola and beer to every remote corner of Africa, it should not be impossible to do the same with drugs,” he declared.Sometimes his campaigns took on an apocalyptic note. At a conference in London in 2004 he warned that while HIV/Aids did not by itself cause wars and insurgencies, it was nonetheless severely destabilising in other ways: “South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland will be potential basket cases if they don't act, and in the case of Botswana, if it doesn't act, it will cease to exist,” he said.Joseph Lange, always known as “Joep” was born at Nieuwenhagen in the Netherlands on September 25 1954 and studied Medicine at the University of Amsterdam, qualifying in 1981 and taking a PhD in 1987.As well as taking leading positions on many international bodies concerned with Aids, from 2006 he was a Professor at the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam, where he guided more than 30 PhD students and published more than 350 papers in peer-reviewed journals. A founding editor of the academic journal Antiviral Therapy, he was also scientific director of HIV[e]Ducation, an online learning site for medical professionals.On Thursday morning Lange boarded Malaysian Airline's flight MH17 to attend an international conference on Aids in Melbourne, Australia, where he was due to speak on Sunday. Both he and his wife Jacqueline have been confirmed as among the crash victims, along with a large number of other delegates travelling to the conference.Lange was the doting father of five daughters. Among the many messages on Twitter posted by his colleagues, one friend recalled how she had often found him cooking for his daughters while on conference calls discussing HIV: “I asked him why he worked so much.

Adolescents: health risks and solutions,"Around 1.2 billion people, or 1 in 6 of the world’s population, are adolescents aged 10 to 19. Most are healthy, but there is still substantial premature death, illness, and injury among adolescents.",,2018-09-30T00:00:00+06:00,"Around 1.2 billion people, or 1 in 6 of the world’s population, are adolescents aged 10 to 19. Most are healthy, but there is still substantial premature death, illness, and injury among adolescents.Promoting healthy behaviours during adolescence, and taking steps to better protect young people from health risks are critical for the prevention of health problems in adulthood, and for countries’ future health and ability to develop and thrive.The main health issues include:Early pregnancy and childbirthThe leading cause of death for 15– 19 year old girls globally is complications from pregnancy and childbirth. Better access to contraceptive information and services can reduce the number of girls becoming pregnant and giving birth at too young an age. Laws that specify a minimum age of marriage can help.HIVMore than 2 million adolescents are living with HIV. Although the overall number of HIV-related deaths is down 30% since the peak in 2006 estimates suggest that HIV deaths among adolescents are rising. Better access to HIV testing and counselling, and stronger subsequent links to HIV treatment services for those who test HIV positive, are also needed.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Mental healthDepression is the third leading cause of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents (15–19 years). Violence, poverty, humiliation and feeling devalued can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Building life skills in children and adolescents and providing them with psychosocial support in schools and other community settings can help promote good mental health.ViolenceViolence is a leading cause of death in older adolescent males. Globally, 1 in 10 girls under the age of 20 years report experiencing sexual violence. Promoting nurturing relationships between parents and children early in life, providing training in life skills, and reducing access to alcohol and firearms can help to prevent injuries and deaths due to violence.Alcohol and drugsHarmful drinking among adolescents is a major concern in many countries. It reduces self-control and increases risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex or dangerous driving. Setting a minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol and regulating how alcoholic drinks are targeted at the younger market are among the strategies for reducing harmful drinking.Drug use among 15–19 year olds is also an important global concern. Drug control may focus on reducing drug demand, drug supply, or both, and successful programmes usually include structural, community, and individual-level interventions.InjuriesUnintentional injuries are the leading cause of death and disability among adolescents. In 2015, over 115,000 adolescents died as a result of road traffic accidents. Young drivers need advice on driving safely, while laws that prohibit driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs need to be strictly enforced.Exercise and nutritionIron deficiency anaemia is the leading cause of years lost to death and disability in 2015. Iron and folic acid supplements are a solution that also helps to promote health before adolescents become parents. Regular deworming in areas where intestinal helminths such as hookworm are common is recommended to prevent micronutrient (including iron) deficiencies.Developing healthy eating and exercise habits in adolescence are foundations for good health in adulthood.Tobacco useThe vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuring smoke-free environments are crucial.","['leading', 'death', 'age', 'adolescents', 'reducing', 'risks', 'cause', 'tobacco', 'health', 'hiv', 'solutions', 'young']","Promoting healthy behaviours during adolescence, and taking steps to better protect young people from health risks are critical for the prevention of health problems in adulthood, and for countries’ future health and ability to develop and thrive.

What made them leave?,The 200-year-old Kandapara brothel in Tangail town wears a deserted look following the eviction of about 600 hundred sex workers.

Photo: StarTangail municipal mayor Shahidur Rahman Khan Mukti has come up with a most intriguing theory explaining why more than 600 sex workers left the Kandapara brothel in a single night.If he is to be believed, these women left the brothel in the district because they decided to quit the work they have been doing for years. What motivated them all of a sudden into deciding, and collectively too, to go for a change of profession is not explained.At the level of the local residents, though, there is a different story. They assert that Shahidur and his men forced the sex workers out in order to grab the land of the brothel and its adjacent areas.Having been thus forcibly evicted on the night of July 12, these sex workers find themselves in double trouble -- they have nowhere to go and they have no income.   Many have taken shelter on the streets of Tangail sadar. Others are working as floating sex workers.One of them is 25-year-old Punnyo (not her real name). She said she made the streets of Tangail sadar her home along with some 1500 brothel residents, including children, aged sex workers and middlemen. She claimed she was sold to a sex trader in Kandapara by her lover, who betrayed her trust, a few years ago.     googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  ""Inside the brothel, customers had to pay and I had some kind of guarantee of financial security.

""Sex workers are at risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We used to give them two strong antibiotics every three months as per WHO and health ministry's guidelines.""Both the programmes have now been hampered, he said, adding: ""How can we locate them now?""Akhteruzzaman cited a study by ICDDR, B that shows floating sex workers are at greater risk of HIV-AIDs and STDs than those in brothels.After the eviction, Punnyo and a group of about 150 other sex workers are constantly on the run in fear of retribution by local goons and those who drove them out.""They are driving us away from this town,"" said Punnyo.She described how on Monday night someone posing as a customer contacted her and made a deal to buy her sex for Tk 30, about eight times less than she got in the brothel.

So unlike many sex workers who were a little well-off, I could not move to other brothels in Mymensingh or Jamalpur.""In fact, there is no way to go back to the Tangail brothel either.Visiting Kandapara on Wednesday, this correspondent found about 20 labourers knocking down the rooms built on over 300 decimals of land.Asked why they were doing it, they said the owners had sold the bricks of the rooms.Abdul Mannan, one of the owners living close to the brothel, said he owned 10 decimals of land and that he sold the bricks of his rooms.""I am not going to rent this place to sex workers any more,"" he said, adding that nobody had forced him or other owners to knock down the structures.""I will go to the mayor and seek his advice on how best the land can be used,"" he added.One sex worker, who claimed to have owned 11 rooms there, said, ""How can I sell anything? I am running for my life,"" she said.According to her, of the 357 decimals of land there 310 decimals belonged to 49 sex workers.But the municipal mayor, Shahidur, said most of the land was owned by 51 locals. ""One or two of the owners might have been sex workers but now they live in other neighbourhoods.""Talking to reporters on Tuesday, he caused fresh surprise when he said he was not aware that the sex workers had been evicted.But he admitted to The Daily Star that he was present at a meeting where members of a local mosque committee had spoken about demolishing the brothel.""I am the chairman of the mosque committee. I was attending the regular monthly meeting, where a few people stood up and delivered speeches on the issue,"" he said.""Their non-violent movement had been going on for long, and we did not realise anything like this would happen. And there is nothing to be done if someone willingly quits his profession.""The district administration is aware of the eviction and its consequences.Mahboob Hasan, deputy commissioner of Tangail, told members of the Sex Workers Network on Tuesday that he would look into their demand for a resettlement of the evicted sex workers.But the victims do not see much of hope.""Do you think I can ever get back to my land?"" said a female owner who rented out about 20 rooms in the brothel.""I was forced to sell the bricks of the rooms at a loss of 40 percent. If we had the courage to stand up against the eviction, we would not have left the 200-year-old brothel on a single night,"" she said, requesting anonymity.(Our Tangail correspondent contributed to this report.)","['brothel', 'workers', 'sex', 'land', 'night', 'eviction', 'tangail', 'owners', 'left', 'rooms', 'leave']","But now, heroin addicts assault me on the street, force me to have sex with them and leave without paying.""
Akhteruzzaman cited a study by ICDDR, B that shows floating sex workers are at greater risk of HIV-AIDs and STDs than those in brothels.

The looming threat of AIDS,Photo: Russell Thurston,,2010-12-11T00:00:00+06:00,"Photo: Russell ThurstonHealth officials and concerned citizens in the country are grappling with the national implications of the HIV/Aids crisis and have been trying to come up with an answer to combat the threat that it poses. Experts see clear indications that the disease that was once supposed to be confined to some specific areas is now spreading wider.Reports from India's National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) suggest that India had 2.27 million HIV affected people in 2009. These reports make people genuinely concerned since the virus may have crossed the borders with the traveling people and has started playing havoc in the country. Recalling the days when the first Aids case was detected in the country in 1989 -- the carrier being a returnee from abroad -- officials in the government argued that Aids was a western disease that would not affect our uniquely moral society.Out of 219 people diagnosed to be carriers of HIV virus till 2002 at BSMMUH at Dhaka, 111 were returnees from abroad, 26 of them later developed full-blown Aids and 20 of them died. Compared with the infection figures in African countries and India, Bangladesh is still considered a low HIV/Aids prevalent country. It is estimated that there are about 13000 HIV-positive people in the country now as revealed by WHO sources.UN experts have indicated that a disaster is waiting to happen in the Asian region, including Bangladesh. There are some 5 million new cases each year, of which 58% people under 25. Bangladesh has hundreds of sailors, construction workers and other professionals who work abroad for a time, and a continual tide of students and businessmen returning from overseas.Understandably, the growing number of HIV cases in India calls for stepping up efforts to halt the spread of the disease through cross border transmission. The most worrying aspect is the trafficking of teenage girls to India who eventually come back to Bangladesh, carrying with them HIV infection, and spread the disease.Villages in Bangladesh, these days, to say nothing of the cities and towns, are not, in fact, the bastions of sexual probity they are quaintly imagined to be. Studies show that Bangladeshi society, long considered so conservative, is more footloose than is commonly admitted. Experts have clear indications that the killer disease that once prowled the red light areas now stalks the bourgeois neighbourhoods.The increasing incidence of HIV infection in the country as revealed on the eve of the ""World Aids Day"" baffles the people and gives an alarming signal for all. Social researchers say: ""In our country, with all the economic problems, rising unemployment and drug abuse, only Aids was missing. Now we too haven't been spared."" If the number continues to increase, as it has done from 219 infected people in 2002 to 13,000 by the end of 2009, it will be especially ominous for the country since it does not have medical facilities, physicians or drugs to adequately treat the disease.In Bangladesh, Aids treatment is completely NGO-dependent. Sources close to the government revealed that some donor-assisted NGOs like Ashar Alo society, Open Sky Bangladesh, and Confidential Approach to Aids Prevention (CAP) are providing ARV medicine to some 452 AIDS- infected patients.Aids is now the fourth leading cause of death globally and the leading cause of death in Africa. But interventions seem dauntingly difficult because Asian societies keep the source under wraps, a vice that stems from ignorance and lack of proper education. Sex in our society is not a subject of polite conversation. Public health officials have long despaired of this taboo because it makes the task of raising public awareness of sexually transmitted diseases more difficult.In most cases in our country, marriages are arranged and sex education is non-existent. The actual number infected with the virus may be quite high. The majority of the people who are infected now don't even know they are ill. We are talking about a generation that will have developed Aids sometime after the year 2015. And the country simply does not have the wherewithal to deal with such a crisis.Promiscuity is the single most important way by which the scourge has the possibility of spreading. People must know its incubation period, that keeps the virus hidden and after a certain time explodes in a virulent form, almost like an epidemic. So, an infected person can pass the virus unknowingly to scores of people.Most people with such promiscuous behaviour do not use contraceptives while having sex since they do not know that it exposes them to sexually transmitted diseases. Most worrisome, the virus now percolates insidiously and afflicts low risk individuals like housewives and children of wealthy people.Experts attribute this shift in the sexual behaviour of middle class or lower income groups to changes of culture in the workplace as the major reason. Besides, lack of housing facilities in the work place has spawned a breed of workers who spend half of their working lives away from home and family. At the same time, women have become an increasingly visible part of the professional workforce in industries, garment factories, hotels and business houses. With all these factors taken together, one can only see the settings for an increasing number of casual sexual relationships.Social scientists point out that the growing affluence of the middle class and the influence of alien movies have something to do with changing moral values. Without contradiction, one can say that the influence of the West is not an escapable factor. We have borrowed the gloss, but not the ability to fight a crisis.While, maintaining multiple sexual relationships is now considered ""high risk"" behaviour in the West, in our country, it has just become a symbol of liberation. At the same time, women are shedding their inhibitions and sexual ambitions of both the groups are running high.In the face of the impending Aids threat  that is likely to jolt the country by the end of 2020,  the government from, now on, will have to launch an intensive programme to halt the spread of the disease. The health ministry must ensure that hospitals and clinics ensure safe blood transfusion of patients and think seriously about screening those who they thought might be using drugs -- focusing mainly on young unemployed men. Lastly, both the administration and people must contend with the fact that Aids is no longer a medical problem, it is a social problem.This is a county where people are more inclined to holding seminars and symposia and formulating policies on the World Aids Day every year, without trying to implement the policies. We only hope that the government this time will not cause any shift in the rationale of the national agenda.  Md. Asadullah Khan is a former teacher of physics and Controller of Examinations, BUET.

Criminalised sex workers at high risk of HIV in Asia



Barrister Md. Abdul Halim



THE criminalisation of sex workers, drug users, and men who have sex with men were highlighted as major sources of concern in the fight against HIV in Asia, at the world AIDS conference in Vienna on Wednesday, July 21, 2010.

Twenty-five countries in the Asia-Pacific region still impose the death penalty for offences related to the possession and abuse of drugs, creating a huge stigma that means abusers often avoid treatment for fear of imprisonment, said Anand Grover, a lawyer and special rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Council.

Injected drug use is acknowledged as one of the main causes of the spread of AIDS worldwide, alongside sexual transmission.

In some countries, ""drug users still have to go to jail before they actually can access harm reduction services"", said Rachel Ong, of the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV (APN+).

Meanwhile, over 15 countries penalise consensual same-sex behaviour, pushing potential HIV patients further underground, according to Anand.

This trend of criminalisation is not customary for the region but rather an ""alien British colonial legacy and we have to get rid of it"", he said provocatively.

In parts of India, small tablets of opium are traditional gifts, he noted, adding that in earlier times, ""sex workers... were revered, they were given a high status"".

The current trend needs to be reversed and these groups decriminalised, Anand urged.

Ong meanwhile criticised that Asian governments lacked visibility in the fight against HIV/AIDS, compared to the richer nations, which donate much of the aid to fighting the disease.

""The donors' block usually makes most of the decisions and it's very difficult for the implementing countries, or countries in 'the global south' as they call it, to actually voice their opinions.""

However, several Asian nations, such as Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Singapore -- which still has the death penalty for drug-related offences and where homosexuality is illegal -- are no longer developing countries and should make a bigger contribution to human rights, she said.

Promise to fight,,,2009-01-03T00:00:00+06:00,"Second SAARC conference on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases was organized by SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre (STAC) on 15-18th December, 2008 in Kathmandu.STAC started functioning in Kathmandu, Nepal since 1992 as one of the regional centres for SAARC with the objective to work for prevention and control of tuberculosis and HIV related tuberculosis in the region by coordinating the efforts of the National Tuberculosis Control Programmes of the member countries. Later on STAC has been mandated to work for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in the region (during birth it was named SAARC Tuberculosis Centre. HIV/AIDS was added in the name in 2006).While carrying out activities, STAC realised that it is also necessary to exchange knowledge based on research activities to have clear picture of the region and insight of newer ways. Keeping these in mind, STAC organised maiden conference in 2004 followed by the second one in 2008.The theme of this conference was HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases. As HIV destroys one's immune system, infected person becomes prone to opportunistic infections like tuberculosis and other respiratory tract infections. In such situation patients have to fight against multiple pathology. That is why, efforts needed to be made to disseminate knowledge not only on HIV but also infections like tuberculosis that takes the chance of immune suppression caused by HIV. That is exactly what STAC attempted in second SAARC conference on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases.Delegates from SAARC countries presented paper elaborating HIV situation of their countries. In India, an estimated number of PLHA is 2.47 million. An estimated 85,000 and 70,256 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Pakistan and Nepal respectively. Though it is a matter of great relief that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults is less than 1% in Bangladesh with an estimated number of infected 7500 we must not be complacent about the current data. HIV infection in Bangladesh is still believed to be confined among the vulnerable groups such as sex workers, injecting drug users because of their risk behavior.One presentation informed that 77.2% of male IDUs in Dhaka have reported borrowing or lending used syringes. Once the virus is leaked and spread in general population, we will have to face the HIV epidemic.We, as a nation have to be aware to prevent HIV infection. But what about those people who already are living with the virus? Do we have positive attitude towards them? Now time has come to stop scaring people in the name of HIV/AIDS. We have to understand that people can live with HIV infection.All we need to have a positive approach towards PLHA. Acquiring HIV is unfortunate, not crime. If Mr. Co-chairperson of that specific session, living with the virus can roam around the world (he has to attend a lot of conferences) raising his voice for the rights of PLHA, why not others can live.People with AIDS have to be within comprehensive coverage of ART. It is revealed from the conference that there is about ten times more DOTs center than ART centers in Nepal. ART needs to be made available at low cost to HIV positive people. They need to be given total support against all health hazards they could possibly suffer. If cushioned properly, people living with HIV/AIDS can also live a productive life.The writer is a Research Associate at James P.

Improving global health outcomes demands a unified effort,,,2008-12-06T00:00:00+06:00,"Recently published arguments that increased funding for HIV is to blame for the chronic underfunding of broader health systems are rooted in a simplistic analysis of how global health priorities are established.Tragically, these arguments risk pitting natural allies against one another, and obscure the very real synergies that exist between the global response to HIV and the push to strengthen health systems in poor countries. Those living with and vulnerable to life-threatening diseases in these countries stand to gain far more by unified efforts to expand overall funding for global health than they do by efforts to reapportion the inadequate resources now devoted to such issues.In the context of today’s global financial crisis, it is extremely short-sighted for health advocates to suggest that the urgent and very real non-HIV health care needs of the world’s poor could be solved simply by reallocating AIDS funding to other health issues. Such an approach let’s our political leaders off the hook, and in the midst of the political process used to allocate funding, all too often results in less, not more, funding overall.The hard-won progress against HIV/AIDS has come as the result of the tireless, frontline efforts of researchers, health care workers, advocates, volunteers, and people living with HIV (PLHIV) over nearly three decades.While we are seeing the fruit of those efforts in many places, the greatest challenges and the most significant costs are still ahead. An estimated 70% of PLHIV in need of treatment still do not have access to it. Many people at risk for infection have no access to proven prevention programmes, and stigma and discrimination still stymie both treatment and prevention initiatives.The success of the global response to HIV, including treatment and prevention scale up, is not in competition with the goal of strengthening health systems, but rather depends on it. No one understands this better than frontline AIDS professionals who regularly struggle to do their jobs, often with insufficient physical and human resources.Blaming the AIDS response for a shortcoming that was many decades in the making is unwarranted. It also fails to recognise how the roll out of HIV treatment has in many cases eased the pressure on such systems by reducing demand for hospital beds, thereby allowing them to be used for non-HIV patients, and by putting health care workers living with HIV back to work.The creation of new diagnostic laboratories, clinics and medical training facilities has and will continue to have broader, positive effects on public health in underserved communities, as will more aggressive screening and care for pregnant women living with HIV.The push for universal access has also had a major effect on global health advocacy by galvanising patients to demand their right to health care and combating stigma and discrimination against vulnerable populations. For the first time in decades, global health issues are front and centre on the international agendas of such bodies as the United Nations, the G8 and the African Development Forum.Many advocates for primary care, pre- and post-natal care, maternal health and sexual and reproductive health recognise the opportunities presented by this momentum and are finding ways, at the country and international levels, to join forces with those working on HIV to develop an even stronger movement for global health.As the AIDS movement gains traction and recent investments begin to demonstrate tangible progress, it is unfortunate that criticisms from those outside the field are appearing.Demands for a bigger slice of the global health funding pie, which was never big enough in the first place, is short-sighted, at best. The global response to AIDS provides an opening and a mandate to address the chronic under-financing of health systems in developing countries. We must act as a unified global community to seize this opportunity –– it is an opportunity we cannot afford to squander.The article is a Media Statement from Julio Montaner, President, International AIDS Society; Director, BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['effort', 'unified', 'improving', 'outcomes', 'aids', 'demands', 'living', 'response', 'health', 'systems', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'global', 'care', 'funding']","Recently published arguments that increased funding for HIV is to blame for the chronic underfunding of broader health systems are rooted in a simplistic analysis of how global health priorities are established.

"Towards universal access to prevention, treatment & care",,,2009-12-04T23:00:00+07:00,"December 1, 2009 was marked as the 21st anniversary of World AIDS Day. Together with its partners, the World AIDS Campaign set this year's theme for the Day as “Universal Access and Human Rights”. Global leaders have pledged to work towards universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care, recognising these as fundamental human rights. Strong commitment, sustainable programmes and urgent action are crucial to augment the progress in access to HIV/AIDS services.The prevalence of HIV/AIDS has increased up to 7 percent among Injecting Drug Users (IDU) in parts of Dhaka city, which is termed concentrated epidemic.  Although HIV prevalence is said low and it is less than 1% in other risk groups including sex workers, the risks involve in spreading HIV/AIDS are still very high.Despite dramatic developments in political commitment, funding and treatment provision, significant progress has not yet been made in prevention and eliminating stigma and discrimination. These are some major obstacles that hinder people to access HIV/AIDS services, especially Antiretroviral Treatment (ART).Even though injecting drug use is an important driving force behind the spread of HIV in Bangladesh; many of these people cannot access the services due to social stigma, lack of proper counselling, satisfactory rehabilitation programmes and their migrating nature.Again, sex workers cannot access proper services due to stigma, lack of condom use, risky sexual behaviour.  There is an urgent need to increase coverage of targeted interventions such as 100 percent condom use for sex workers, needle–syringe exchange programmes and substitution therapy for IDUs.It has long been recognised that gaining the upper hand against AIDS epidemics around the world will require rapid and sustainable expansion in HIV prevention. Integrated prevention programmes with most at risk population (MARPs) like IDUs, female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), vulnerable youth lead by Government can make a significant progress in fight against HIV/AIDS.The encouraging progress made in expanding access to treatment has not yet been properly matched with a parallel scale up of prevention. This is very crucial to ensure long-term success against the epidemic and the sustainability of treatment programmes. The health sector must play a much more effective role in HIV prevention, especially in expanding HIV testing and counselling, offering prevention services to people living with HIV/AIDS.Unless the gap in prevention, treatment and care is reduced rapidly, the epidemic will cause an irrevocable social and economic havoc in the region.Scaling-up of the HIV/AIDS strategy in the region involves developing a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS as well as addressing the need to expand coverage geographically to reach more people. It also focuses on increasing coverage to different population types, improving the quality and scope of services, and ensuring that the involved systems are accountable.The ultimate goal is to guarantee the delivery of a comprehensive intervention and programme to reduce the transmission of HIV/AIDS and lessen its impact on individuals and societies.Established public private partnership for high quality prevention, care and support services intended for responding the HIV epidemic throughout the country. Many non-government entities are engaged in implementation of project activities in collaboration with national AIDS/STI programme. However, low prevalence rate indicates that prevention is possible and has worked. So, based on our experiences and lessons learnt, priorities in programmes would be continued to focus on most vulnerable and un-served key populations at full coverage with evidence base approaches.We hope to see that Bangladesh will make a significannt difference in halting the HIV epidemic through standard prevention model. For this, we need to implement effective, sustainable and strong comprehensive action plans for protecting the nation from HIV/AIDS.The writer is a development professional working on HIV/AIDS.

International AIDS Candlelight Memorial Day in Bangladesh

Lighting the path to a brighter future





Every year the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial draws thousands of communities together across the globe to light candles and demonstrate support for those who have been affected by HIV/AIDS. The International AIDS Candlelight Memorial Campaign, a programme of the Global Health Council, based in USA, is a 12-month mobilisation project that encourages communities and individuals around the world to become more involved with HIV/AIDS work through participation in a worldwide memorial. The Memorial takes place every year on the third Sunday of May. The date for this year's International Candlelight Memorial was May 21, 2006, 3rd Sunday of the month, where worldwide coalition of coordinators has joined for orchestrating local candlelight memorial, a program of the Global Health Council for that day. The communities all over the world gathered together in solidarity to light the candle and remember those who have been impacted by HIV/AIDS. The Theme of this years' memorial was ""Lighting the Path to a Brighter Future"". The campaign has four main objectives: 1. To honor the memory who were lost to AIDS 2. To show support for those living with HIV and AIDS 3. To raise community awareness and decrease stigma related to HIV/AIDS; and 4. To mobilise community involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said, ""We must make people everywhere understand that the AIDS crisis is not over; that this is not about a few foreign countries, far away. This is a threat to an entire generation, that it is a threat to an entire civilisation..."" Memorial observed in Bangladesh This year Rotary Club of Dhaka East (RI District 3280), in collaboration with UNFPA, ACNielsen Bangladesh, Social Marketing Company, Sanofi-Aventis, STD/AIDS Network and many other NGOs working on HIV/AIDS commemorated the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial at Dhaka Press Club. A large number of people including journalists and press people participated in the event and expressed their solidarity. In addition, other organisations such as ICDDRB, Mukto Akash, Bandhu Social and other NGOs have observed this event at different places in Bangladesh. Impact Through observing this event, it helped increasing awareness, understanding, volunteerism, reducing HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination and fundraising opportunities. This has also created a sense of global solidarity toward PLWHA (People Living with HIV/AIDS).

Confronting AIDS in Asia,"AS a Korean, and the first UN Secretary-General from Asia in more than 30 years, it's no surprise that I often speak of my home continent as a model for economic development. Yet, when it comes to the AIDS epidemic, I am more disheartened than proud. Across Asia, AIDS remains the most likely cause of death of people in their most productive years.

Meanwhile, the death toll mounts, with some 440,000 people succumbing to AIDS each year.",,2008-03-28T00:00:00+06:00,"AS a Korean, and the first UN Secretary-General from Asia in more than 30 years, it's no surprise that I often speak of my home continent as a model for economic development. Yet, when it comes to the AIDS epidemic, I am more disheartened than proud.Across Asia, AIDS remains the most likely cause of death of people in their most productive years. At the rate we are going, the current 5 million Asians infected with HIV will grow to 13 million by 2020. Meanwhile, the death toll mounts, with some 440,000 people succumbing to AIDS each year.Asia's flourishing economic prosperity does not help groups that are most vulnerable to the disease. People living with HIV -- including many in low-risk groups -- are denied their basic rights to health.This is deplorable, considering how little is required to contain the epidemic and help those in need. A new report, ""Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an effective response,"" by the Commission on AIDS in Asia, an independent body initiated by UNAIDS, finds that annual investment of just thirty cents per capita can reverse the epidemic through prevention. That would translate into saving the lives of more than 200,000 people each year.I know my continent has the resources, the technology and the ability to undertake this ambitious and life-saving mission. Asia's fast-growing economies have emancipated millions of poor people. Most countries on the continent are on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, our common vision for building a better world in the 21st century.But if we fail to act, we could threaten the very prosperity that places Asia in a position to respond effectively now. We are in danger of spinning into a vicious circle where the AIDS epidemic grows so serious as to undermine economic growth and social resilience, leading to more and more infections at ever-greater cost.Experience shows Asia's ability to act in the face of grave threats. We saw this in the response to SARS five years ago. Beyond the immeasurable good of saving lives, action will bring a tangible economic boost. For every dollar we spend on preventing HIV today, the report notes, we will save eight dollars on treatment in the future.Our response to AIDS is not only about money. It is, above all, about people. The stigma associated with AIDS can be worse than the disease -- robbing people of access to basic human rights and health care, preventing them from living a dignified life, and deterring them from getting tested for HIV.Some of my most inspiring experiences as Secretary-General have been my meetings with UN+, the group of our staff members living with HIV. Their courage and expertise have given me new and invaluable insights into the epidemic. Hearing from these people, who speak with such directness about their lives, I felt ashamed of the discrimination that people living with HIV often face around the world, and perhaps especially in Asia.Painful as these lessons may be, I value them and intend, on my next visit, to visit a facility or organisation addressing the needs of those living with HIV and AIDS.Listening is important. But beyond that we must engage with people living with HIV as we develop policies and carry out programs to address the epidemic.Women and girls are the main caregivers -- and they are also disproportionately vulnerable to HIV infection. They need special attention. We must tackle social norms that prevent women from protecting themselves, including through better legislation, or better enforcement of existing laws.And we must guard against legislation that blocks universal access by criminalising the lifestyles of vulnerable groups. We have to find ways to reach out to sex workers, men who have sex with men and drug users, ensuring that they have what they need to protect themselves.It starts with Asian Governments showing leadership to invest more substantially in the fight against AIDS and move resolutely to stamp out stigma and discrimination.This June, the UN General Assembly will hold a high-level meeting offering an opportunity to take stock and advance the global response to AIDS. I personally will do all I can -- as a Secretary-General and an Asian -- to be at the vanguard of this effort. I look to the leaders of Asia to do the same.Ban Ki-moon is Secretary-General of the United Nations.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['need', 'epidemic', 'secretarygeneral', 'aids', 'economic', 'confronting', 'response', 'vulnerable', 'asia', 'hiv', 'living']","Yet, when it comes to the AIDS epidemic, I am more disheartened than proud.

Myths and fears,"source: BDHS, 2011 Universal access to reproductive health (RH) is one of the sub-targets for the Millennium Development Goal number five which is to improve maternal health. One of the major barriers to improve the universal access to reproductive health is myths and fears associated with RH.",,2013-08-28T00:50:43+06:00,"source: BDHS, 2011Universal access to reproductive health (RH) is one of the sub-targets for the Millennium Development Goal number five which is to improve maternal health. One of the major barriers to improve the universal access to reproductive health is myths and fears associated with RH.In rural areas of Bangladesh, there is prevalence of local knowledge about RH that differs significantly from the medical/scientific school of thought. For instance, there is a certain belief regarding menstruation that a woman should not visit specific places or avoid certain foods during that time. These ideas deriving mainly from the elderly members of the population, can present challenges to girls beginning their menstrual cycles. As a result, girls are kept in the dark about proper medical knowledge and are stopped from reaping the benefits of modern medical innovations.A more common fear regarding RH is the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. In Bangladesh the concept of HIV/AIDS usually carries a negative connotation with it and anyone suffering from the disease is looked upon with a sense of skepticism. In addition, misinformation regarding prevention and spread of HIV/AIDS is rampant. These two factors coupled together stop many men and women from accessing medical support as they are afraid to get tested or admit positive results for fear of stigmatization. Due to this, statistical data on those living with HIV/AIDS is not accurate and is likely to be an underestimation.Another socially-created anxiety is that surrounding the exposure to sex education in Bangladesh. There is a popular belief that sex education and exposure to sex-education materials will lead to more adolescent sexual activity. This puts many to risk as they are kept in the dark regarding many STDs and their preventions leading to greater health hazards. Moreover, many people can shy away from seeking medical support upon contraction of STDs due to the stigma attached to that.Another problem is that many men and women withdraw from consulting with nurses or doctors of the opposite sex. For instance, a male patient often finds it uncomfortable to openly discuss his problems relating to RH with female doctors or nurses. Conversely, a female patient feels reserved to talk about her problems with health providers of the opposite sex. This inhibition serves as a barrier for many from attaining RH support.In order for RH programs and policies to be effective, it is important that these policies take into account the role of religious attitudes in Bangladesh. A considerable degree of RH organizations received favorable cooperation from community religious leaders. However, when it came to topics of intimacy between unmarried people, these leaders refused to cooperate. This leaves a certain section of people outside the circle of RH services.An interesting point to note is that Sylhet and Chittagong need the highest priority when it comes to reproductive health services. Modern contraceptive prevalence rate is the lowest and the rate of unmet need for family planning is the highest in these two divisions. It should be pointed out that Sylhet and Chittagong also have the lowest secondary school enrolment rates, implying they are lagging behind in education compared to other divisions. Lack of education can be one of the reasons why awareness about RH is low in those divisions.Access to proper RH is crucial as it not only ensures good health to the parents but also to the children. Attention must be given in order to eradicate the barriers in order to improve access to RH in Bangladesh otherwise Millennium Development Goal number five 'Improving maternal mortality' would not be attained.The writer is the head of research at The Daily Star and can be reached at faaria.ts@gmail.com    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['medical', 'hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'sex', 'reproductive', 'health', 'rh', 'fears', 'order', 'myths', 'regarding', 'education']","source: BDHS, 2011Universal access to reproductive health (RH) is one of the sub-targets for the Millennium Development Goal number five which is to improve maternal health.

The minister said a large number of women and children are being trafficked to India, Pakistan and the Middle East countries.

And most of them got affected by HIV/AIDS as they are forced to prostitution, slavery and sex slavery, he added.

The minister emphasised the need for raising awareness about the deadly disease to check its spread as Bangladesh has been identified as 'high-risk country'.

The government has set up 98 centres for blood screening to prevent the spread of AIDS, he added.

Major General Dr. ASM Matiur Rahman said the women and children become more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS after being trafficked to another country as they do not have control over their profession and working environment.

Several socio-economic factors like poverty, low-level of literacy, gender inequality, high density of population, and increased mobility made the South Asian region more vulnerable to AIDS epidemic, he said.

He called for proper law enforcement, gender equality and empowerment of women to reduce the vulnerability of women and children to HIV/AIDS.

In his keynote paper, Prof. Nazrul Islam of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University said that Bogra, Brahmanbaria, Chapainawabganj, Cox's Bazar, Dhaka, Dinajpur, Gopalganj, Jessore, Lalmonirhat, Mymensingh, Narayanganj and Satkhira have been identified as areas from where the women and children are picked up.

He said India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan are also facing the trafficking problem and organised crime syndicates are involved in this crime.

Ashok K Rao of Freedom Foundation, India, emphasised the need for proper rehabilitation of the trafficking survivors.

He said that HIV-positive people face stigma, discrimination and exploitation in the society and they are deprived of human rights.

He called for showing more sympathetic attitude towards them.

Representatives from India and Pakistan and national and international NGOs took part in the conference.","['india', 'daily', 'hivaids', 'minister', 'trafficking', 'women', 'children', 'vol', 'vulnerable', 'web', 'num', 'aids', 'trafficked', 'pakistan', '59', 'star', 'edition']","The minister said a large number of women and children are being trafficked to India, Pakistan and the Middle East countries.

First gene-edited babies claimed in China,A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.,,2018-11-26T11:34:46+06:00,"A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics.A US scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes.Many mainstream scientists think it’s too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus.He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done.There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press. “I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He told the AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science.Photo: APSome scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it.It’s “unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal. “This is far too premature,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. “We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal.”However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat.” “I think this is justifiable,” Church said of that goal.In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems.He Jiankui speaks during an interview at a laboratory in Shenzen. Photo: APIt’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it’s not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.He Jiankui (HEH JEE’-an-qway), who goes by “JK,” studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies.The US scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He’s two companies.The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods.Embryologist Qin Jinzhou looks through a microscope at a laboratory in Shenzen. Photo: APHe said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes.Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate.He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym “Bai Hua,” told the AP that it’s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed.Zhou Ziaoqin places an embryo in a storage tube at a laboratory in Shenzen. Photo: APHere is how He described the work:The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added.When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said.Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do.Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm.They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes. “It’s almost like not editing at all” if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said.Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered. “In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you’re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,” Musunuru said.The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ “main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,” Church said.Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it’s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said.There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials.It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program.The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he “absolutely” thinks they were able to understand the risks.Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine. “That might be a layman’s way of describing it,” he said.Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials.The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they’re adults.Zhou Ziaoqin places an embryo in a storage tube at a laboratory in Shenzen. Photo: APFurther pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a “first” was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered.He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts.Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants’ HIV infection from being disclosed.“We think this is ethical,” said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel.Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He’s lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts.The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.” “I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”","['editing', 'pregnancy', 'babies', 'participants', 'china', 'risks', 'research', 'geneedited', 'chinese', 'gene', 'embryos', 'human', 'hiv', 'claimed']","China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.

Change in men's behaviour vital,Guests at a discussion titled “Men's involvement in the context of HIV prevention in Bangladesh” organised by The Daily Star at The Daily Star Centre in the city yesterday. Photo: STAR,,2011-11-21T00:00:00+06:00,"Guests at a discussion titled “Men's involvement in the context of HIV prevention in Bangladesh” organised by The Daily Star at The Daily Star Centre in the city yesterday. Photo: STARPositive changes in sexual behaviour patterns of men, particularly the young, are crucial to a prevention of HIV/AIDS, said health experts yesterday.Though males hugely contribute to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, the authorities do not put much effort into engaging them in a prevention of the diseases, observed the experts.The focus is only on women's reproductive health, which is not enough. Therefore, they suggested, extensive studies should be conducted to find innovative ways to bring men under HIV prevention programmes.The observations came at a roundtable titled ""Men's involvement in the context of HIV prevention in Bangladesh"", jointly organised by the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and The Daily Star at the latter's conference hall in the city.Though HIV prevalence in the country is low thanks to religious and cultural values, such diseases threaten to turn into a pandemic as a large number of people here take drugs through injections.Besides, men are increasingly reluctant to use condoms, even while having sex with sex workers, the speakers said at the roundtable.In this highly male-dominated society, men exercise their power to influence women's sexual and reproductive health choices. Therefore, involving only women is not enough to prevent HIV, said Khandaker Ezazul Haque, HIV officer of UNFPA.The authorities need to work with men to change certain attitudes and behaviour patterns, he added. Attention should also be given to changing ideas of masculinity in them.Unicef HIV/AIDS specialist Bridget Job-Johnson said a recent baseline survey had found that many young people, aged between 15 and 24, have unsafe sex.Around 35 per cent of the women diagnosed with HIV get infections from their male partners, she said, calling for a renewal of the commitment to the task of preventing the deadly disease.Hasina Begum, UNFPA Bangladesh assistant representative, said studies in Senegal and Thailand have shown that men's involvement in HIV/AIDS prevention programmes proves to be very effective.UNFPA Representative Arthur Erken said projects intended to change men's sexual behaviours need a long time to achieve success. And for that the government has to pursue its development partners to fund those for longers period of time, he noted.Erken, who moderated the discussion, also suggested integrated programmes focusing on reproductive health and prevention of HIV/AIDS for both men and women.Fadia Sultana, senior manager of Save the Children, said there should be a clear understanding of what changes have to be brought into men's sexual behaviour and what technique has to be adopted to do that.She suggested incorporating HIV/AIDS issues in textbooks to make sure that boys and girls were well informed in this regard.Speakers at the discussion also recommended taking measures on a priority basis for some targeted groups like young population, garment workers, street children, and transport workers.""Even if half of the five lakh street children take drugs through injections, what happens to the future of HIV prevalence?"" asked Brother Ronald Drahozal, executive director of Apon, a drug rehabilitation centre.Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of The Daily Star, said though HIV prevalence was low in Bangladesh, there was no scope for complacency. The issue has to be brought into the public domain to create more awareness.Abdul Wahed, line director of National AIDS/STD Programme; The Daily Star Strategic Affairs Editor Brig Gen (rtd) Shahedul Anam Khan; World Health Organisation HIV/AIDS Consultant Enamul Haque, Toitomboor's International and Culture Editor Nasnain Sabihnayak, Family Health International Country Director Misti McDowell and Technical Director Shamim Jahan, Samir Kumar Howlader of International Organisation for Migration; Nazmul Alam of ICDDR, B; Gias Uddin of Family Planning Association of Bangladesh; and Safat Hasan of National Youth Forum also spoke at the roundtable.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['prevention', 'hivaids', 'bangladesh', 'behaviour', 'change', 'men', 'hiv', 'mens', 'health', 'sexual', 'vital', 'director', 'young']","Positive changes in sexual behaviour patterns of men, particularly the young, are crucial to a prevention of HIV/AIDS, said health experts yesterday.

A challenging perspective,"FOR the first time in more than 35 years since Aids was identified the epidemic seems to have been arrested, according to the 2009 epidemic data. One of the major contributing factors for the reduction is the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/Aids signed in 2001.",,2010-04-08T00:00:00+06:00,"FOR the first time in more than 35 years since Aids was identified the epidemic seems to have been arrested, according to the 2009 epidemic data. One of the major contributing factors for the reduction is the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/Aids signed in 2001.However, the diminishing rate of infection is just the tip of the iceberg and has not fully revealed the socio-economic consequences of HIV/Aids epidemic disrupting the productive flow of life. It is now established that HIV/Aids is not merely a health concern because its expansion encompasses all the dimensions unique to the individual it infects, the family it affects and the community that it impacts -- as such each epidemic is different.Therefore, the new paradigm for addressing HIV/Aids is to ""know your epidemic.""   Declining trend of infection in one region cannot fully provide the global scenario as there are now an estimated 40 million HIV/Aids cases in the world. In 2008 alone 2.7 million new infections occurred and 2 million people died of Aids related illness.Fortunately, for Bangladesh, a ""high risk and low prevalence country,"" the national HIV/Aids program is prepared to contain it. It has progressed extensively, covering the various aspects of prevention, care and support and treatment. But Bangladesh, besieged by a myriad of socio-economic concerns, requires pre-emptive measures that must focus on evolving issues for immediate redress.The correlation between climate change and HIV/Aids may be an atypical notion, but the United Nations Millennium Development Goal integrating HIV/Aids as a development agenda suggests that global organisations are taking cognisance of the environment of risk determined by poverty and climate change impact.The most pervasive result of climate change and environment degradation is population displacement. Research findings show that the growth of environmental displacement in Bangladesh is likely to be close to about half of total population in 2020.Bangladesh is exposed to severe natural disasters; floods and droughts are regular phenomena that force people to migrate from rural to urban settings. They end up as climate refugees in the streets and proliferating urban slums. This influx has resulted in rapid and unplanned urbanisation in Bangladesh. According to International Organisation for Migration, Bangladesh, urban population may reach about 68 million, or 37 percent of the total population, by 2015.A substantive proportion of this segment becomes chronically mobile in search of work and subsistence. This landless and homeless mass merges with the existing ultra-poor, resulting in population increase in urban slums and burgeoning poverty.Evidence shows that HIV/Aids and poverty move in a vicious cycle of cause and effect and, therefore, the global efforts for containing the epidemic focus on poverty as a significant determinant for its spread. Population density mixed with poverty is the recipe for any communicable disease to spread.HIV/Aids is described as more of an urban phenomenon, hence the situation is conducive for an epidemic to set in. For Bangladesh this is very alarming.The revised National HIV/Aids strategy puts emphasis on the external migrant labour work force as a vulnerable segment and identifies this group as being the most at risk.  But the majority of the people internally displaced due to climate change related factors remain outside the social security and HIV/Aids prevention program.NGOs, civil society and grassroots organisations are making efforts to reach the climate refugees in the urban streets and slums but, without a national policy and coordination of the government machinery, these endeavours remain sporadic and isolated.The national HIV/Aids program is a well coordinated mechanism engaging the stakeholders and developing innovative approaches for visible impact. For the first time, HIV/Aids prevention awareness has broken the denial and silence barrier in the country through mass media.This progress runs the risk of failure if the program does not acknowledge the multiplying challenges. The standard way of preventing and containing communicable disease is ""early warning rapid response system,"" which has to reach all, with focus on the high-risk segment. The national program effectively launched this design.Now the emphasis should be on strengthening the integrated approach to initiate the discourse on climate change and HIV/Aids from the perspective of ""climigration,"" and capture the most vulnerable, under-served and increasing number of people.In 2007, Bangladesh launched a National Action plan aimed at reducing the disease burden from current and projected risks due to climate change by empowering and equipping health system institutions in the country.Hence, there is no reason to delay the inclusion of climate change and environment degradation related displaced population. The 7th Round of National Serological Surveillance shows that there is a concentrated epidemic amongst the injecting drug users and in one locality within Dhaka 10.5 percent of injecting drug users where found to be HIV positive.Increasing poverty due to the impact of global economic recession, increase in climate related migration and accelerated mobility of population may change the course of the still low prevalence status and silently develop it into a generalised epidemic. Time is of the essence in addressing HIV/Aids ""right now, right here and in the right way.""Health research per se and HIV/Aids surveillance, specially at the national level, needs to widen their scope to find out the implications of climate change for future impacts on health and related issues, and develop a tiered health service system strengthening process that is dynamic, flexible, manageable and sustainable to address the evolving needs.Most importantly the government needs to focus on resettlement strategies and their implementation, mobilising the available resources and integrating them systematically into multi-sector operations.There has to be a concerted political will and effort to reach beyond the traditional frameworks of treating the root causes of HIV/Aids.

So, the WB on June 16 warned the government of discontinuing the project if the process cannot be completed by June 30.“We don't want service disruption as it will lead a huge number of high-risk group to a vulnerable condition and also would tend to increase the prevalence of AIDS/STD in the country,” said Dinesh Nayar, team leader of HNPSP (Health Nutrition and Population Sector Programme).Under the HATI project, the injecting drug users (IDUs), brothel, street, hotel and residence-based sex workers and their clients and MSMs (males having sex with males) were provided services to control HIV/AIDS by around 200 NGOs. The time frame of service providing was fixed initially for 18 months from January 2009-June 2010 after completion of the 2nd phase of the project in December 2008.But the dilly-dallying of the NASP to select NGOs to provide service to those high-risk groups lead 120,000 population to be deprived of getting services from April 2009 under three packages, including intervention for street-based sex workers, hotel and residence-based sex workers and internal migrant/client of sex workers as the activities are closed since April 2009.The reason is that the NGOs that could not win the bidding process stopped working while the new NGOs, which won the bidding, are yet to go through final agreement and cannot start their activities yet.But the rest three packages, which include interventions of brothel-based sex workers, IDUs and MSMs that continued their activities till June, might be stopped now, raising the toll of vulnerable people to 1,69,000 as fresh bidding is yet to be completed.Without showing any apposite reason, NASP re-tendered for these three packages cancelling prior proposal from interested NGOs and bidders again submitted the proposal to NASP.But if the government fails to choose the NGOs properly within a very short time and if the WB does not continue the project, the future of approximately 169,000 target population will be uncertain, said the activists working with the vulnerable groups, adding that many of the Drop in Centres (DICs) have been closed by this time from where the high-risk groups used to receive services.Talking to The Daily Star, Programme Manager of NASP Abdur Rahman, however, said WB would not create any problem as in a meeting on June 25, the government and the WB reached an understanding that the bidding would be completed within a very short time soon after revising the operational plan.He further said that service is not interrupted anywhere.But the fact is that Care Bangladesh has already stopped its activities under the HATI project.“The 32 DICs which were run by the Care directly to provide services to the IDUs have been closed from June 30,” said Selina Ferdous, team leader of Care Bangladesh, adding that they sent a letter to the government regarding this in 1st week of June and as the government neither responded to the letter nor signed any agreement with them, they stopped providing services.“HIV prevalence would increase if the beneficiaries are deprived of getting services,” said Prof Nazrul Islam of Virology department at BSMMU, adding that very few people were brought under the coverage and if they are dejected in this way, it will be harmful for society.The achievements of last five years would be wiped out if the programme is halted even for few days, according to experts.The NGOs continuing their activities under HATI project also apprehended that taking the chance of weaknesses of HATI, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) is capturing the targeted interventions. For this reason, those who would win the bidding process won't have any place to work for.However, Save the Children USA, which is managing the fund and technical side of GFATM fund, said it has been working with 45 NGOs and as per the government decision, it is working with a small group of IDUs at a specific point at old Dhaka in the city where the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is highest among the IDUs.“We are working here just for an interim period,” said Deputy Director in Programme Implementation and Management Amjad Ali.Considering AIDS a national priority issue, the government established NASP as a separate wing under the health and family welfare ministry.

Laying emphasis on women empowerment, Rokia said, “We now want the girls to be educated to ensure women empowerment.”Praising the efficiency that the students of the first batch of AUW have achieved in last four months since they started their course in April this year, Rokia hoped that they would definitely be the future leaders in the region.AUW Access Academy Executive Director Dr B Regina Papa said the university has an international outlook but it would reflect the aspirations of the people in Asia.Dr Dil Afroze Quader, special adviser to the vice chancellor of AUW, gave the vote of thanks.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['region', 'rokia', 'malaysia', 'auw', 'aids', 'women', 'asian', 'different', 'female', 'started', 'public', 'awareness', 'fight', 'edn', 'education']","Speakers at a seminar in the port city yesterday underscored the need for proper education among the women to create competent leadership for fighting AIDS and social problems prevailing in the South and South East Asian region.

Mixed messages on sex work undermine HIV prevention

Civil society is preparing to challenge a recent government decision in Bangladesh to exclude “prostitution” as a profession on new voter cards on the grounds it effectively blocks sex workers' access to HIV prevention and life-saving health care.

On 17 August the Bangladesh Election Commission (BEC) announced “prostitution” would be recognized for the first time as a profession on new voter ID cards. But pressure from conservative religious groups led the BEC to reverse its decision, according to Shahnaz Begum, president of Sex Workers Network (SWN), a local NGO that works in half of the nation's 64 districts.

Election commissioner Sohul Hossain told IRIN the term “sex worker” was omitted in order to prevent commercial sex work, in line with Article 18(2) of Bangladesh's constitution, which states that “gambling and prostitution” should be “discouraged”.

But activists are seizing upon Article 40 of the constitution, which gives citizens the right to “enter upon any lawful profession or occupation”, arguing that women, therefore, can choose sex work as a profession.

This decision is “ripe for a public interest challenge”, said Khaled Chowdhury, a lawyer at the Supreme Court. “Sex work is not illegal, but as moral and social issues are involved, it is not encouraged. The decision of the EC [Electoral Commission] may have an impact [on the acceptance of sex workers], as voter ID cards are now essential in many aspects of a citizen's life.”

ID cards are necessary to open a bank account, apply for a passport, and to register property. While not required for health services, almost all other government forms require an ID card as proof of identity.

Limited legality

When the government tried to shut down two large brothels in Dhaka, the capital, a decade ago, 100 sex workers fought back - and won. As a result, sex work is now legal for women over 18, pimps and brothel owners.

But the ruling offers sex workers little protection, as police still frequently harass them, which, according to Begum, can lead to unsafe sex practices. “Clients are often taken to a dark alley and the sex workers have to rush because they are on the lookout for police. If sex work was properly recognized they could take the time to convince their clients to use a condom.”

To make matters worse, a sex worker in Dhaka who gave her name and age as Tania, 28, said police often demand half her average daily earnings of US$7. And without police protection, she has little recourse when clients are abusive. “Yesterday a client gagged and beat me. I don't want to live this life any more.”

Health care

The government has offered no-cost health care to sex workers at designated clinics around the country since 1978, but the Health Ministry reports that only 2,000 sex workers used these services in 2009 (0.5 percent of the 400,000 sex workers the NGO SWN estimates are working nationwide).

Begum said the government's mixed messages about sex work are hurting the fight against HIV because sex workers who seek medical treatment are often turned away on the grounds they are “bad women”.

A consistent government stance on sex work would help prevent such discrimination, she added. “The legal framework for sex workers exists, but it is not implemented. The mixed public health messages from the government and Election Commission are undoubtedly harmful for reducing the spread of HIV.”

NGO clinics

There are dozens of NGO-run drop-in centres nationwide that provide free HIV counselling, condoms and medicines, and a referral system for HIV testing to sex workers and their clients. IRIN spoke to 10 sex workers: All said they preferred to visit NGO clinics due to the conservative attitudes of public health staff.

In 2007, 67 percent of sex workers reported using a condom with their most recent client, according to the UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) 2008 Progress Report.

According to the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in 2009 estimated HIV prevalence among Bangladesh's 160 million people was less than 0.1 percent. The rate for sex workers was about 1 percent, according the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

However, the Global Fund warned that a highly mobile population, coupled with poverty and a low level of awareness about HIV, threaten to increase prevalence.

And until the law can protect sex workers and guarantee their access to health care, civil society leaders taking their case to court say that Bangladesh's status as a low HIV prevalence country may change.

“HIV is not spreading at an alarming rate, but I believe it would decrease further if the government gave [it] full recognition,” said Begum.

Legal protection is one of the issues to be addressed at the first UNAIDS consultation in Asia on sex work and HIV to be held 12-15 October in Pattaya, Thailand.

Recent surveys reveal that the number of injecting drug users (IDUs) in Bangladesh is rising. What is more frightening is that many of them are HIV positive. Indiscriminate needle sharing and unprotected sex among the IDUs pose a high risk of the virus spreading into the general population. As the World AIDS Day approaches on December1 SWM takes a look at the threat of an epidemic in Bangladesh in the context of inadequate state interventions and the efforts of a few organisations to introduce sustainable methods to rehabilitate IDUs and contain the spread

of the virus. MoniIruzzaAman a farmer from Elaipur village in Rupsha upazila and his wife were in for the greatest shock of their lives when they took their sick son to Khulna Shishu Hospital. Blood tests revealed that the infant was HIV positive. This prompted the doctors to get blood samples from the other family members. All of them - the father, mother and two other children were tested positive for HIV. A physician who knows the family, suspects that the mother may have been infected with the virus when she received six bags of blood 11 years ago during the complicated delivery of her first child. This frightening tale gives a glimpse of the gravity of the problem. First, of the complete lack of awareness about HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and secondly that we have no idea about how fast and how widely it is spreading. While sexual intercourse is the most obvious way for the virus to be transmitted from one person to the other, needle sharing between drug users has been found to be the most common cause for the spread of the virus. Last year, a survey detected a near HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs) in a pocket of central Bangladesh. The fifth round of HIV surveillance by the Centre for Health and Population Research of the ICDDR,B (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) reports, ""The HIV epidemic in Bangladesh, from an epidemiological perspective, is evolving rapidly. While still a low prevalence country for overall HIV rates, a small pocket of IDUs under second generation surveillance, has shown an HIV prevalence increase from 1.4% to 4% to 8.9% (in one locality) in the past three years."" The prevalence rate is what health experts consider a concentrated epidemic in a particular social section. It also means there is too high a risk of the epidemic fanning out for the society to remain complacent about. But, Bangladesh continues to remain indifferent to the frightening report. Since the first case detected in 1989, only 465 cases of HIV infection were officially reported until December 2004. Of the infected, 87 have developed AIDS and 44 have died. On the other hand, even back in 2002, UNAIDS estimated that some 13,000 adults and children were HIV positive in the country, which by now should have increased at least three-fold, considering the upward trend detected in the ICDDR,B survey. Explaining the chasm between the government and the UN estimates, National AIDS/STD Program (NAP) states, ""Significant underreporting of cases occurs because of the country's limited voluntary testing and counseling capacity. The social stigma attached to the disease is a further impediment."" When we consider the five unfortunate members of the farmer family, this is even more relevant. Many IDUs sell their blood to get money to buy drugs, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. As the NAP says, ""Bangladesh relies on professional blood-sellers to meet most of the transfusion needs of its people"" Referring to the jump of HIV prevalence among a section of IDUs from 1.4 percent to 8.9 percent over just three years time, NAP observes the virus can spread rapidly within the group, then through their sexual partners, many of them sexual workers and their clients into the general population. There are lessons for us to learn from what happened in Vietnam and Nepal as a consequence of reluctance of the authorities to intervene quickly in similar situations. According to a November 2001 NAP document, ""No drug injectors in the northern Vietnam city of Haipong were infected with HIV just two years ago. Now, HIV prevalence in this group has risen above 60 percent. Since new data confirm that drug injectors in Bangladesh share needles even more frequently than they do in Vietnam, similar rises are inevitable here at some point in the future, unless needle sharing falls drastically."" Even at that time, in 2001, when the third round of sero and behavioural surveillance on HIV infection found its prevalence among IDUs to be 1.7 percent, brothel-based sex workers 0.3 to 0.5 percent and floating sex workers 0.5 percent, NAP cautioned, ""The information now available should set alarm bells ringing for Bangladesh."" Now, at the end of 2005, the alarm bells should be clamouring even louder. The latest Behavioural Surveillance Survey (BSS) data indicates an increase in risk behaviour such as sharing of needles and a decline in condom use in sexual encounters between IDUs and female sex workers. Around 70 percent of the IDUs routinely share needles. The BSS data also indicates that the IDU population is well integrated into the surrounding urban community, socially and sexually, thus raising a grave concern about the spread of HIV infection. The fifth BSS shows a large proportion of the IDUs to have commercial and non-commercial female sex partners and condom use is infrequent. A significant number of IDUs - 4.3-6.7 percent - has also sold blood over the last year. Moreover, IDUs travel from other cities to the capital to inject drugs, increasing the chance of spreading the virus. While passing by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) one cannot miss seeing a number of people looking like they have just come out of hell. Their skin ashen, with ill-health, they wear tattered dirty rags and sit around in scattered groups, sharing a syringe or two to get their daily 'fix'. A particularly dangerous practice of the IDUs is called 'shooting gallery', says Iqbal Faruk, a director of Crea, a pioneering rehabilitation service provider to drug addicts in Bangladesh. ""In fear of getting caught red--handed by the police, they share a large syringe to inject drugs very quickly. This practice is particularly widespread in Rajshahi and also in some pockets of Dhaka,"" he elaborates. Another alarming aspect is the very high prevalence of Hepatitis C (HCV) among the IDUs, which the NAP puts at 83 percent. NAP says, ""This is comparable to levels in countries that are experiencing a concentrated and growing HIV epidemic."" Hepatitis C causes damage to the liver and can lead to fatal diseases such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. The hepatitis C virus can be contracted through transmission of infected blood or body fluids by transfusions, needleshaving, sexual intercourse or from an infected mother to her baby. The fifth sero survey also reveals that about 8 percent of heroin addicts often switch to injectable drugs as an alternative. Thus they too should be counted among those who share needles in shooting drugs. Barely two months old, Modhu, a baby boy, lives in a rehabilitation centre for drug addicts at Lalbagh in Old Dhaka. He is actually lucky to be alive. His mother, an intravenous drug user resorted to prostitution to sustain her habit and was admitted at the centre in an advanced stage of pregnancy. If she were not here, Modhu might not have seen the light of life at all or might have ended up forsaken on a footpath. His mother certainly could not have borne the costs of a caesarean or the subsequent complications of a premature baby. She was also in no state to take care of a child, being preoccupied with how to get her next fix. Modhu was born in the small hours of October 2. ""His mother had been in labour since the previous evening,"" says Lavlu, Crea-Modhumita rehab centre-in-charge. ""We took her first to Azimpur maternity centre. But when the hospital staff learnt about her drug addiction and her occuptaion, they refused to admit her. The same thing happened when we went to Bangladesh Medical College and Hospital. At last we managed to get her admitted to Ibne Sina Hospital."" ""The amniotic sac was ruptured, and it was a pre-mature delivery at only seven and a half months of pregnancy. The birth weight was low, too only 1.9 kg,"" pitches in Dr. Baquirul Islam Khan, who left his prestigious job as programme manager of Grameen Kalyan to manage the Crea-FHI HIV Prevention Project. ""So, we had to go for a caesarean section and keep the child in an incubator for several days. Then he caught bronchopneumonia and we had to transfer him to Shishu Hospital,"" he adds. When the woman returned to the rehab centre with the baby, the 30 plus inmates including 11 women and the 25 staff members felt a sudden shift in the environment. Two months into its launching, the centre seems more like a home than a detention camp. They decided to name the boy Modhu and if any girl-child is born here in future to name her Mita. Modhu-Mita has become the brand name of a range of HIV/AIDS prevention services such as the needle exchange programme, drop-in and crisis support centres for drug addicts, medical facilities for sex workers etc. These services are provided under the IMPACT project of Family Health International (FHI). IMPACT works with government and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) at the community level to strengthen the care and support systems, to prevent HIV transmission and to promote behavioural change among the high-risk groups. The fifth Behavioural Surveillance Survey found virtually no change in the behavioural patterns of the most high-risk groups between 1997 and 2004. This has shaken up all the agents associated with HIV/AIDS, prevention and control. The FHI and its partners including the government, CARE, Marie Stopes and USAID have realised the urgency of a new and more comprehensive approach to combat the menace. Formerly most of the government, NGO-run and private sector clinical facilities used to offer short-term, usually 14-day, detoxification services to drug addicts including the IDUs, leaving out a crucial follow up rehabilitation. Detoxified patients, without having psychological therapy, social and financial rehabilitation, and counselling, went back to their addiction, particularly those who had lost their means of livelihood. Considering the new findings, IMPACT early this year, decided to launch a completely free and comprehensive package of physical, social and financial rehabilitation for the drug addicts. This initiative offered for the first time an opportunity for the dirt-poor addicts to return to the social mainstream. IMPACT has contracted three renowned organisations Apon, Crea and Ahsania Mission working with the rehabilitation of drug addicts, to provide this service in Dhaka, which is the most high-risk zone in terms of an HIV epidemic. Preference is given to the destitute, IDUs and women. The government, too, is going to expand its 40-bed central treatment centre for drug addicts to a 250-bed one, of which 100 beds will be for patients seeking detoxification and 150 beds for rehabilitation. Of the three IMPACT partners working with the Modhumita brand, Apon will launch a rehab centre exclusively for female drug addicts and Ahsania Mission for males only. They are in the process of setting up the centres. Crea has already opened its centre at Lalbagh that tends to both male and female patients. The patients are referred by CARE drop-in centres but can also seek treatment voluntarily, by themselves, Crea Executive Director Tarun Kanti Gayen, a psychologist working for around two decades in this field. The basic rehab process takes six months, followed by support services, said Gayen. Of the six months, 14 days are for detoxification, then three months for various rehab therapies and training, and the rest are for day-care services, followed by after-care. Again, the detox service is available in three categories: in-house, home and community detoxification. The last two categories are particularly novel. Home detoxification is most suitable for certain categories of addicts such as women, elderly people and service-holders, to whom taking admission to a rehab centre poses the risk of getting stigmatised by society. However, in home detox, the family members of the patient have to be intensely involved in caring for the patient. The patients also are required to go through the rest of the programme at the centre, with leave to stay at home only overnight. In community detoxification, on the other hand, the entire community becomes involved by providing the accommodation for a detox camp, volunteer staff, etc. The Crea-Modhumita has already carried out a community detox programme at Hazaribagh in the city, says Dr. Khan. The October 14-27 programme held at the local community centre started with 24 patients. The local city corporation ward commissioner, Mujibur Rahman, played a key role in arranging the venue, while a local youth club came up with the volunteer staff. Of the initial 24 patients, one had to be transferred to the DMCH as his condition became medically critical and one was expelled for violent behaviour. The remaining 22 successfully completed the course. Gayen says the community detoxification method has proved to be highly successful and sustainable in India, particularly in the southern states. It is because, after detoxification, the patients are helped to get a job and more importantly are treated with compassion and understanding by community members. Thus it also helps eradicate the stigma and segregation attached to drug addiction. This approach, Gayen noted, has the potential to revolutionise the drug addiction and HIV scenarios in Bangladesh, where the government, NGO and private-sector interventions are either too meagre or too ineffectual to make any real difference. Elaborating on the difference between the previously available interventions and that of Crea-Modhumita, Dr Khan says, ""They did not link other essential psycho-social services for relapse prevention, for changing behavioural pattern and mindset, and for increasing self-efficacy with detoxification, which we are doing. After admission to the centre, we screen the patients for sexually transmitted infection (STI) and provide abscess management, bio-safety, counselling to the patients and their family members, as well as vocational training."" At present, patients get in-house training in block printing, tailoring, embroidery and carpentry. Dr Khan says the range of training area will be widened gradually. Those who already have some kind of vocational skills will be referred to higher training institutes. ""We will get the patients graduating the course to form self-help groups and are trying to get funds to provide them with micro-credit to set up small businesses or enterprises so that they can survive financially. We are also considering launching a sort of recovery home for the women who have no shelter or family or have lost it to drug addiction, to help them stay clean,"" Khan adds. As of end-October, 38 patients including 11 women joined the Modhumita course, says Tuheen, a staff member of the centre, against the target of treating 475 in-house patients a year. Half of them, he says, are IDUs. The identity of patients who know they are HIV positive as well as those who are found so in tests are kept strictly confidential. They are completely free to decide whether to get treatment and/or counselling or not. The HIV/AIDS services are provided by Jagori of the ICDDR,B while Marie Stopes helps treat the STI cases. Mariam (not her real name) a patient, says that she has not been taunted or harassed by the male-in-mates of the centre. She was referred to this centre by a CARE drop-in centre in September. After the 14-day detoxification, she went home for a day and relapsed when she heard her husband had married again. For two days she lived her former life of addiction, but then realised her mistake and returned to the centre to start recovering once again. Mariam was introduced to drugs at a very young age. ""I was married at the age of 17. My husband used to drink, smoke ganja and take other stuff. We lived in City Palli. I started to smoke pot with him. After two/three years I began to drink Phensidyl and then started taking heroin."" To feed her addiction, she started to steal from her mother and relatives' homes. Every day, she needed at least 300 taka and sometimes spent up to 1,000 taka on drugs. Eventually, she fell into prostitution and injecting drugs with others in the profession. Mariam has a nine-year-old boy who does not live with her. Only her mother may give her shelter now on the condition that she stays off addiction and returns to normal life. ""I want to be good again, so that nobody can blame me anymore. Then I will bring my son to me."" She is learning embroidery and tailoring, and hopes to make a living from it someday. Under the IMPACT-Modhumita drive, Apon, Crea and Ahsania Mission together aim at rehabilitating at least 3,000 drug addicts in three years from now. But, considering the huge number of drug addicts _ around 4600000 in the country according to FHI estimates (including some 25 to 30 thousand IDUs) _ 3,000 is just a drop in the bucket. The intervention appears even more inadequate as a recent baseline survey by CARE in 20 districts reports the tendency of drug injecting to be rising rather than falling. The government must acknowledge the extent of the threat of the spread of HIV. While the prevalence is higher among marginal groups such as IDUs and sex workers; it is from these groups that the virus will reach the general populace because of lack of knowledge about the risks of needle-sharing, unprotected sex and transfusion of untested blood. Along with state interventions, communities must take responsibility to educate its members about HIV and take care of them when they are sick.

With the support of UNICEF we took gynaecologists, paediatricians and virologists to Thailand to see their treatment and care procedures. Once they understand then they feel confident about the treatment protocol of such patients. In my opinion it is easier to be infected with Hepatitis C or tuberculosis virus than HIV,” she adds.“In general an HIV positive person is treated with a judgmental attitude from health service providers irrespective of the nature of their health needs. It is seen that any health needs, particularly those associated with surgery where there are chances of bleeding, are avoided by the service providers. They are afraid of transmission of infection to themselves or infecting their instrument and other accessories in the operation theatre or other in-patient services. This could be easily prevented if the institutions adopt universal precaution services; which mean adequate sterilization of instruments and proper precaution of service providers for preventing cross transmission of any infection including hepatitis or HIV,” says Dr Ziya.“It's a standard mandatory procedure irrespective of giving service to a HIV positive person or not. In reality all the institutions of Bangladesh lack in proper universal precaution services and monitoring, so they are reluctant to provide surgical services to an HIV positive person. It's not a matter of any extra modern technology or instruments,” explains Dr Ziya.UNICEF is working to support services in the of PMTCT (Prevention of Maternal To Child Transmission), where they are raising awareness of clinicians, nurses and other staff, identifying pregnant HIV positive women and providing testing kits and other reagents, drugs, and support for proper deliveries of HIV positive mothers whether normal or Caesarean.

Towards 'zero discrimination',,,2013-12-03T00:00:00+06:00,"While welcoming the solid progress being made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, United Nations officials marked World AIDS Day with urgent appeals for the international community to work even harder to end stigma, discrimination and complacency, to stop new HIV infections among children and to ensure access to care and treatment for all those that need it. “On this World AIDS Day, I am more optimistic than ever.Much of the world is accelerating progress in responding to HIV,” said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, with major drops in new infections and deaths and progress in realising the target of ensuring 15 million people have access to antiretroviral treatment by 2015. “This is crucial to halting and reversing the AIDS epidemic for good,” he added.But, the UN chief continued, as revealed in the UNAIDS 2013 World AIDS Day Report, there are still worrying signals that some regions and countries are falling behind.

Where men and women face the same disease, men often seek health care less than women.  In countries with generalised HIV epidemics, for example, men are less likely than women to take an HIV test, less likely to access antiretroviral therapy and more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses than women. Similarly, male TB patients appear to be less likely to seek care than female TB patients.The report also highlights the difference in causes of death between men and women – some biological, some influenced by environmental and societal factors, and some impacted by availability of and uptake of health services.Of the 40 leading causes of death, 33 causes contribute more to reduced life expectancy in men than in women. In 2016, the probability of a 30-year-old dying from a non-communicable disease before 70 years of age was 44% higher in men than women.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  Global suicide mortality rates were 75% higher in men than in women in 2016. Death rates from road injury are more than twice as high in men than in women from age 15, and mortality rates due to homicide are 4 times higher in men than in women.Life expectancy has improved since 2000Between 2000 and 2016, global life-expectancy at birth increased by 5.5 years, from 66.5 to 72.0 years.  Healthy life expectancy at birth - the number of years one can expect to live in full health- increased from 58.5 years in 2000 to 63.3 years in 2016.Life expectancy remains strongly affected by income. In low-income countries, life expectancy is 18.1 years lower than in high-income countries. One child in every 14 born in a low-income country will die before their fifth birthday.For the first time, this year, WHO’s Global Health Statistics have been disaggregated by sex. This new analysis has provided insights into the health and needs of people around the world. But many countries still struggle to provide gender disaggregated information.","['drives', 'access', 'likely', 'men', 'world', 'expectancy', 'women', 'countries', 'rates', 'lowincome', 'gaps', 'health', 'life', 'services', 'uneven']","The World Health Statistics 2019 – disaggregated by sex for the first time – explains why.

Bangladesh's community clinics could be a model,Global leaders and activists in the fight against AIDS consider Bangladesh's community clinics as an opportunity and a possible model to reduce HIV infection as part of a global agenda to eliminate the virus by 2030.,,2016-03-15T01:56:27+06:00,"Global leaders and activists in the fight against AIDS consider Bangladesh's community clinics as an opportunity and a possible model to reduce HIV infection as part of a global agenda to eliminate the virus by 2030.There are some 11,000 community clinics at the grassroots level meant to provide maternal and neonatal, family planning and nutritional services and establish linkage with the medium and tertiary level hospitals.Adopting a “Dhaka Declaration” on the closing day yesterday, the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) said it recognises Bangladesh's community clinics as a model to provide services to reduce maternal mortality and “as an opportunity to reduce mother to child transmission of HIV as well”.The congress emphasised greater integration of HIV response with regular health systems, mainstreaming it in development programmes. It requested donors, governments and bi-lateral and multi-lateral organisations to invest adequately.ICAAP acknowledged that resource generation for AIDS response should not be an exclusive responsibility of developing countries.“Rather, it should be a global shared responsibility for which resources should be allocated based on the relative vulnerability of societies, rather than prevalence rates alone and accordingly cooperate for such resource generation,” said Bangladesh's State Minister for Health and Family Welfare Zahid Maleque while presenting the Dhaka declaration.The ministry and Partners in Population and Development organised the three-day event at International Convention City Bashundhara. Some 2,000 participants from across the globe attended.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  According to World Health Organization, there were approximately 36.9 million people, including 2.6 million children, worldwide living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2014. Besides, 34 million people died from AIDS-related causes so far, including 1.2 million in 2014.Government statistics say Bangladesh has registered 3,674 cases of HIV infection since detection of the first case in 1989.However, experts say the estimated number of people living with HIV is around 9,500, making Bangladesh a low-prevalence country.However, existence of vulnerable communities such as sex workers and transgender people, of a large number of migrants and men having sex with men are still matters of concern.Zahid said there exists a lack of technical capacities to predict, understand and combat the HIV epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region. He called upon relevant United Nations agencies and other international organisations to support the national and regional HIV responses.He stressed on promoting health, dignity and human rights of key affected populations and engaging the communities in designing and implementing the programmes.Addressing as chief guest, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said treatment of HIV patients was extremely important because everyone has the right to live with dignity and healthcare. He said the poor, if infected with HIV, become the worst victims.“We want to eradicate poverty by 2024 and do the same in terms of AIDS,” Muhith said.Health Minister Mohammed Nasim said the Asia-Pacific region made significant progress in reducing infections and AIDS-related deaths, but there were still some pockets where the trend was slightly alarming, which requires immediate and focused intervention.UNAIDS Representative Dr Salil Panakandan said, “Fighting AIDS is not a finished job. We need to work together to end the disease by 2030.”Health Secretary Syed Monjurul Islam also spoke.","['bangladeshs', 'model', 'community', 'clinics', 'reduce', 'minister', 'aids', 'million', 'international', 'health', 'hiv', 'global']","Global leaders and activists in the fight against AIDS consider Bangladesh's community clinics as an opportunity and a possible model to reduce HIV infection as part of a global agenda to eliminate the virus by 2030.

First-ever WHO list of essential diagnostic tests,"Today, many people are unable to get tested for diseases because they cannot access diagnostic services.",,2018-05-27T00:00:00+06:00,"Today, many people are unable to get tested for diseases because they cannot access diagnostic services. Many are incorrectly diagnosed. As a result, they do not receive the treatment they need and, in some cases, may actually receive the wrong treatment. For example, an estimated 46% of adults with Type 2 diabetes worldwide are undiagnosed, risking serious health complications and higher health costs. Late diagnosis of infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis increases the risk of spread and makes them more difficult to treat.To address this gap, World Health Organisation (WHO) recently published its first Essential Diagnostics List, a catalogue of the tests needed to diagnose the most common conditions as well as a number of global priority diseases.The list concentrates on in vitro tests, i.e. tests of human specimens like blood and urine. It contains 113 products: 58 tests are listed for detection and diagnosis of a wide range of common conditions, providing an essential package that can form the basis for screening and management of patients. The remaining 55 tests are designed for the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of “priority” diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus and syphilis.Some of the tests are particularly suitable for primary health care facilities, where laboratory services are often poorly resourced and sometimes non-existent; for example, tests that can rapidly diagnose a child for acute malaria or glucometres to test diabetes. These tests do not require electricity or trained personnel. Other tests are more sophisticated and therefore intended for larger medical facilities.“Our aim is to provide a tool that can be useful to all countries, to test and treat better, but also to use health funds more efficiently by concentrating on the truly essential tests,” says Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines, Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals. “Our other goal is to signal to countries and developers that the tests in the list must be of good quality, safe and affordable.”    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  For each category of test, the Essential Diagnostics List specifies the type of test and intended use, format, and if appropriate for primary health care or for health facilities with laboratories. The list also provides links to WHO Guidelines or publications and, when available, to prequalified products.Similar to the WHO Essential Medicines List, which has been in use for four decades, the Essential Diagnostics List is intended to serve as a reference for countries to update or develop their own list of essential diagnostics. In order to truly benefit patients, national governments will need to ensure appropriate and quality-assured supplies, training of health care workers and safe use. To that end, WHO will provide support to countries as they adapt the list to the local context.WHO will update the Essential Diagnostics List on a regular basis. In the coming months, WHO will issue a call for applications to add categories to the next edition. The list will expand significantly over the next few years, as it incorporates other important areas including antimicrobial resistance, emerging pathogens, neglected tropical diseases and additional non-communicable diseases. Source: World Health Organisation","['diagnostic', 'diagnosis', 'essential', 'diagnostics', 'firstever', 'countries', 'test', 'health', 'list', 'diseases', 'tests', 'intended']","To address this gap, World Health Organisation (WHO) recently published its first Essential Diagnostics List, a catalogue of the tests needed to diagnose the most common conditions as well as a number of global priority diseases.

“AIDS Jaago”: Films that awaken,"A scene from “Migration”, directed and produced by Mira Nair.",,2009-12-06T23:00:00+07:00,"A scene from “Migration”, directed and produced by Mira Nair.What could be more opportune on World AIDS Day (December 1) this year than a series of short films by well-known Indian film directors that combine a socially relevant theme with gripping storylines?That's a brief rundown of “AIDS Jaago” (AIDS Awaken), a series of four short dramatic films, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on HIV-AIDS, which were screened at the American Centre in New Delhi.The films: “Migration” (directed and produced by Mira Nair, of “Monsoon Wedding”, “Mississippi Masala” and The Namesake” fame), “Blood Brothers” (directed by Vishal Bhardwaj the award-winning filmmaker behind “Omkara”), “Positive” (by Farhan Akhtar, a most prominent young filmmaker) and “Prarambha” (The Beginning) by renowned cinematographer and director Santosh Sivan.What binds the films together is that each of them convey their message forcefully, without the didactic droning that such works are prone to. In  “Migration” we have a star cast of Shiny Ahuja, Irrfan Khan, Sameera Reddy and Raima Sen (grand daughter of legendary actress Suchitra Sen). This Mira Nair film reveals the criss crossing of rural and urban India through the rural protagonist Shiny Ahuja who migrates to Mumbai in search of work. His life is changed forever after an encounter with a bored homemaker (ably played by Sameera Reddy) whose husband  (Irrfan Khan) is a closet gay. He returns to his village and his young wife (Raima Sen) only to discover that he is HIV positive and that his newborn child has also contracted the deadly virus.The films carry nuances not only of agony and despair but also of hope and courage.  Take “Blood Brothers”, for example. With Siddhartha (of “Rang de Basanti”), Pavan Malhotra, Ayesha Takia and Pankaj Kapur in the cast, we get to see how a young man with a positive HIV diagnosis (which turns out to be negative later) allows his life to fall to pieces, while another man whose file has got mixed up with the former, knows that his is HIV positive, yet carries on with optimism and courage.More than rallies and long-winded discussions, films of this calibre can go many miles in dealing with the stigma and discrimination that are conjoined with the disease.Director Mira Nair, the brain behind the “AIDS Jaago' project, has been quoted as saying, “We cannot underestimate the potential of films to change behaviour and transform the world.” Needless to say, more such films that raise awareness on this blight and demolish the numerous myths that surround the disease are necessary.As recent figures indicate, an estimated 33 million people live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. India and Bangladesh are regarded as the hotspots for the disease. The “AIDS Jaago” series could strike a responsive chord in audiences in the subcontinent.  They could also act as a clarion call to a complacent public that believes that HIV/AIDS is a distant threat and all victims pariahs of society.     googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['hivaids', 'nair', 'positive', 'aids', 'awaken', 'sen', 'mira', 'jaago', 'series', 'films', 'young']","What could be more opportune on World AIDS Day (December 1) this year than a series of short films by well-known Indian film directors that combine a socially relevant theme with gripping storylines?

Frozen Shoulder: symptoms you should know,Pain and stiffness can worsen over time until your shoulder feels frozen in one position. Here is how to get things moving again.,,2018-07-29T00:00:00+06:00,"Pain and stiffness can worsen over time until your shoulder feels frozen in one position. Here is how to get things moving again.What is frozen shoulder?It is pain and stiffness in your shoulder that happens slowly. It can worsen until your shoulder seems “frozen” in one position. Although it may take as much as a few years to get completely better, it can improve long before then, especially if you do physical therapy to help with recovery.CausesDoctors do not know exactly what causes it, though some things make you more likely to have it. For example, it can happen if you can not move your shoulder very well because of an injury or surgery, or if you have diabetes, which can worsen symptoms and make them last longer. Thyroid problems, Parkinson’s disease, heart disease, and certain HIV medications also seem to raise your odds of getting frozen shoulder.Who gets it?It is most common if you are in your 50s or 60s, and it is rare for anyone under 40. Women get it more than men. And if you get frozen shoulder on one side of your body, you are up to 30% more likely to get it on the other side.Physical examYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms, injuries and medical history. Then s/he will check your shoulder. S/he will move it herself to see where the pain and stiffness start. This is your passive range of motion. Then s/he will ask you to move it yourself. That is your active range of motion. At the limit, it may feel like your arm is stuck. If you have frozen shoulder, your passive and active range of motion will be less than normal.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  TestsAn “injection test” may help narrow down the cause of your symptoms. Your doctor gives you a shot in your arm that dulls the pain. With most shoulder problems, this gives you a bigger range of motion, but it will not change it much if you have frozen shoulder. Doctors typically only use imaging tests like X-rays, ultrasounds and MRIs to rule out other conditions.ExercisesOnce your frozen shoulder pain starts to ease up, your doctor might suggest arm exercises. A physical therapist can give you moves to do as homework. Take it easy at first. If you “push through the pain,” you could make things worse.MedicineNSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen may curb pain and swelling. More powerful drugs called steroids are sometimes injected directly into the joint. But it can be tricky to get them into just the right spot, and even these will only provide temporary relief of your symptoms.SurgeryYour doctor may suggest this, usually in the “frozen” stage, if nothing else works. There are two methods, sometimes used together. The first is manipulation while you are “asleep” from general anaesthesia. The surgeon moves the joint until it stretches or even tears the tissue. The second method, called arthroscopy, cuts the affected tissue directly. Your surgeon works through small cuts in your skin, using special tools.RecoveryFrozen shoulder gets better for a lot of people within a year if they do physical therapy and use pain medicines and steroid shots if needed. Even without those methods, most people get better within a couple of years, though if you have diabetes, it may be harder to recover. Surgery works pretty well as long as you stick with your physical therapy afterward to rebuild and keep up your strength and mobility.","['things', 'know', 'doctor', 'shoulder', 'motion', 'works', 'pain', 'physical', 'frozen', 'range', 'symptoms', 'worsen']","What is frozen shoulder?

They also stressed the importance of expanding the role of people living with HIV in the planning and provision of health care as a part of the solution.“HIV and global health advocates have enough common enemies, chief among them political complacency and inadequate human and financial resources,” said Dr. Luís Soto Ramírez, Local Co-Chair of AIDS 2008 and Head of the Molecular Virology Unit at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán and Coordinator of the Clinical Care Committee of CONASIDA, Mexico’s National AIDS Council. “In the struggle to recognise health care as a human right, we are natural partners.”“If the urgency of AIDS and the sheer magnitude of human loss we are now experiencing is not enough to compel us to provide even the most basic level of health care to those living in low-income countries, then we, as a global community, are morally bankrupt,” said Dr. Pedro Cahn, International Co-Chair of AIDS 2008 and President of the International AIDS Society and Fundación Huésped in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “If, in the context of AIDS, we walk away from this challenge, we may never get another chance.”More evidence to weigh in determining when and how to start treatmentAccording to Anton Pozniak (United Kingdom) of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, the questions of “when to start?” and “what to start with?"" remain central to people living with HIV and their clinicians as they consider antiretroviral therapy. The move to start treatment earlier is gaining momentum in light of evidence that those untreated patients with CD4 counts above 350 have significantly higher rates of non-AIDS related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. Pozniak stated that clinical trials are needed to weigh the benefits of starting earlier with the downsides of earlier therapy, including toxicity, resistance and maintaining long-term adherence.Debates regarding which therapies to use in initiating treatment also continue in those countries where there is an abundance of choice. The first randomised clinical trial to compare the use of boosted protease inhibitors (PI) with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), both as the anchor of initial treatment regimens, found virological or immunological benefits to both approaches. Pozniak reviewed data on monotherapy with boosted PIs, which may save money and spare users the long-term toxicity of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). He also noted some unexpected toxicities associated with regimens using NRTIs as the backbone of treatment. Some nucleosides are used extensively in resource-poor countries despite these toxicities, because of lower costs. Pozniak also presented evidence of the effectiveness of tailored combinations for treatment-experienced patients. He concluded that in situations where there is a choice of therapies, treatment of HIV has become focused on minimising toxicities and maximising convenience, and that this choice should be offered to all people living with HIV.Strengthening health systems through greater involvement of PLHIVAccording to Morolake Odetoyinbo (Nigeria), CEO of Positive Action for Treatment Access, the greater involvement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) can be a key component of efforts to strengthen fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries. These already fragile systems have been further taxed by the HIV epidemic, which has depleted the health workforce due to illness and death, and magnified the impact of existing malnutrition. Odetoyinbo also warned that lack of treatment literacy and unstable drug supplies are leading to HIV drug resistance and multi-drug resistant TB.Highlighting the existing involvement of PLHIV as counselors, peer educators, and spokespersons, Odetoyinbo explained how PLHIV can do even more to help strengthen health systems if their involvement is rooted in their existing capacities and skills, and not used to simply fill quotas. According to Odetoyinbo, there also must be an environment that allows professionals living with HIV to be actively involved in health systems. PLHIV should have multi-dimensional roles as advocates, watchdogs and managers, and should also be active participants in decision-making bodies responsible for the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of programmes.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['involvement', 'understanding', 'start', 'aids', 'living', 'improved', 'countries', 'greater', 'pozniak', 'health', 'treatment', 'systems', 'strategies', 'hiv', 'care', 'optimal']","Experts warned that the global shortage of health care workers hampers both goals and demands a collective response.

UN calls for strong action to eliminate violence against women

The United Nations marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women with calls for states to take legal action against the global scourge, for societies to change a mindset that permits such abuse, and for women themselves to stand up and speak out against a culture of shame.

“Violence against women remains pervasive worldwide,” Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message. “It is the most atrocious manifestation of the systemic discrimination and inequality women continue to face, in law and in their everyday lives, around the world. It occurs in every region, country, and culture, regardless of income, class, race or ethnicity.”

Noting that leaders at September's UN World Summit pledged to redouble efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and the girls, he stressed that this required a change of the mindset, still all too common and deep-seated, that violence against women is acceptable.

“That means leadership in showing, by example, that when it comes to violence against women and girls, there are no grounds for tolerance and no tolerable excuses,” he declared.

The UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) said violence against women is both a cause and consequence of rising rates of HIV infection: a cause because rape and sexual assault pose a major risk factor for HIV transmission, and a consequence because HIV-positive status makes women more likely to be targeted for abuse.

“Violence against women is the most pervasive violation of human rights, occurring every day, in every country and every region, regardless of income or level of development,” UNIFEM Executive Director Noeleen Heyzer said, citing a UN World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that nearly one in four women will be raped, beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime, sometimes with fatal consequences.

She called for three major actions to break “this vicious cycle” of violence: countries must pass and enforce laws to deter acts of violence against women and reduce the spread of HIV; women who have suffered abuse must speak out to break the culture of shame and stigma; and awareness must be raised on the links between violence against women and HIV/AIDS, especially by the media.

“Together we must prevent and punish violence against women,” UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid said. “Social norms and attitudes that condone discrimination and violence against women and girls can be changed. This is the first step, which requires awareness raising, behaviour change and social mobilization.”

She, too, called for strengthened legal protections as well as the provision of health information and services.

Urging stronger efforts to fight violence against women, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour also called for a change of mindset.

“We urge States to challenge societal values that support discrimination against women and legitimize violence against them, adopt specific legislation addressing domestic violence and end impunity for crimes committed against women,” she said in a message co-signed by the Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Yakin Ertürk.

The first-ever WHO study on domestic violence, released, shows that intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence in women's lives - much more so than assault or rape by strangers or acquaintances. The study reports on the enormous toll physical and sexual violence by husbands and partners has on the health and well-being of women around the world and the extent to which partner violence is still largely hidden.

“

This study shows that women are more at risk from violence at home than in the street and this has serious repercussions for women's health,” WHO Director-General Lee Jong-wook said. “The study also shows how important it is to shine a spotlight on domestic violence globally and treat it as a major public health issue.”

The Women's Health and Domestic Violence Against Women study, based on interviews with more than 24,000 women from rural and urban areas in 10 countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia and Montenegro, Thailand and Tanzania, calls for action by policy makers and the public health sector, including integrating violence prevention into a range of social programmes.

Saying protecting refugee women from violence was one of his top priorities, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres said in a message to all UNHCR staff: “We know that they are constantly subject to violence, abuse and exploitation in many operations around the world.”

“Discussions with women and girls across all regions, be it Colombia, Darfur, Bangladesh, (the former Yugoslav Republic of) Macedonia, or Pakistan, unfortunately confirm that in addition to rape and sexual abuse, girls can be harassed and subject to violence as they go to school, collect firewood, or go to work, as well as through traditional harmful practices and domestic violence.”

A global call to action for science-based drug policy,,,2010-07-03T00:00:00+06:00,"Three leading scientific and health policy organisations recently launched a global drive for signatories to the Vienna Declaration (www.viennadeclaration.com), a statement seeking to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies.The Vienna Declaration is the official declaration of the XVIII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2010), the biennial meeting of more than 20,000 HIV professionals, taking place in Vienna, Austria from 18 to 23 July 2010 (www.aids2010.org).“Many of us in AIDS research and care confront the devastating impacts of misguided drug policies every day,” said AIDS 2010 Chair Dr. Julio Montaner, President of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and Director of the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. “These policies fuel the AIDS epidemic and result in violence, increased crime rates and destabilisation of entire states — yet there is no evidence they have reduced rates of drug use or drug supply. As scientists, we are committed to raising our collective voice to promote evidence-based approaches to illicit drug policy that start by recognising that addiction is a medical condition, not a crime.”The Vienna Declaration describes the known harms of conventional “war on drugs” approaches and states:“The criminalisation of illicit drug users is fuelling the HIV epidemic and has resulted in overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences. A full policy reorientation is needed… Reorienting drug policies towards evidence-based approaches that respect, protect and fulfill human rights has the potential to reduce harms deriving from current policies and would allow for the redirection of the vast financial resources towards where they are needed most: implementing and evaluating evidence-based prevention, regulatory, treatment and harm reduction interventions.”Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, injecting drug use accounts for approximately one in three new cases of HIV. In some areas of rapid HIV spread, such as Eastern Europe and Central Asia, injecting drug use is the primary cause of new HIV infections. Legal barriers to scientifically proven prevention services such as needle programmes and opioid substitution therapy (OST) mean hundreds of thousands of people become infected with HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) every year. The criminalisation of people who inject drugs has also resulted in record incarceration rates placing a massive burden on the taxpayer. HIV outbreaks have also been reported in prisons in various settings internationally. This emphasis on criminalisation produces a cycle of disease transmission, along with broken homes and livelihoods destroyed. Yet these costs, along with the more direct costs of the ‘war on drugs’, produce no measurable benefits.The Vienna Declaration calls on governments and international organisations, including the United Nations, to take a number of steps, including:• undertake a transparent review the effectiveness of current drug policies;• implement and evaluate a science-based public health approach to address the harms stemming from illicit drug use;• scale up evidence-based drug dependence treatment options;• abolish ineffective compulsory drug treatment centres that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and• unequivocally endorse and scale up funding for the drug treatment and harm reduction measures endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations. The declaration also calls for the meaningful involvement of people who use drugs in developing, monitoring and implementing services and policies that affect their lives.The effectiveness of opioid substitution therapy (OST) and needles and syringe programmes is well-documented, though access to such interventions is often limited where HIV is spreading most rapidly. According to various scientific reviews conducted by WHO, the US Institutes of Medicine and others, these programmes reduce HIV rates without increasing rates of drug use. These cost-effective interventions also produce significant savings in future health care costs, and help people who use drugs access health care and drug treatment. No evidence exists demonstrating negative consequences of use of these programmes.“Reflecting the AIDS 2010 theme of Rights Here, Right Now, the Vienna Declaration is rooted in the belief that global drug policy must respect the human rights of people who use drugs if it is to be at all effective,” said AIDS 2010 Local Co-Chair Dr. Brigitte Schmied, President of the Austrian AIDS Society. “No one who is familiar with addiction would deny the negative impacts it has on individuals, families and entire communities, but those harms do not justify human rights violations. People addicted to illicit drugs have the right to evidence-based drug treatment, to interventions to prevent infection, and, if they are living with HIV, to antiretroviral treatment.”Those wishing to sign on may visit www.viennadeclaration.com, where the full text of the declaration, along with a list of authors, is available. The two-page declaration references 28 reports, describing the scientific evidence documenting the effectiveness of public health approaches to drug policy and the negative consequences of approaches that criminalise drug users.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['drugs', 'aids', 'action', 'policies', 'health', 'treatment', 'sciencebased', 'vienna', 'rights', 'declaration', 'hiv', 'policy', 'drug', 'global']","Three leading scientific and health policy organisations recently launched a global drive for signatories to the Vienna Declaration (www.viennadeclaration.com), a statement seeking to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies.

The Fear Of The Unknown,Monica stood at the edge of her own dining area behind the wooden door and stretched out her plate for food; just like an outcast.,,2013-05-24T00:10:38+06:00,"Monica stood at the edge of her own dining area behind the wooden door and stretched out her plate for food; just like an outcast. Her mother-in-law who was serving food to the other family members shovelled a few morsels of food on her plate and thrust it her way as if even touching her plate would infect her with the terrible virus.Monica Das, 26, is HIV positive. The deep vermillion powder on her forehead says Monica is a married Hindu woman. She lives with her in-laws in Keraniganj, a mofassil town on the outskirts of the metropolitan Dhaka.“My in-laws are orthodox and me being HIV positive is like a double jeopardy for me. They would not care to understand that I was infected by their son, my husband,” she opens up pouring out her frustrations. “I cannot put to words the amount of discrimination and prejudice I had to face because of my health condition. My infant child was taken away from me; I was not allowed to do household chores such as cutting fish or other tasks. I was barred from sitting with my family. My life was nothing less than hell,” she continues to relate.“Luckily for us, a peer counsellor from Ashar Alo Society, an organisation of PLHIV (People Living with HIV) came to our town and my husband got treatment from them and when he started improving, his family's attitude towards me slowly started to change. Now we are living in our own separate house with our daughter who is in Class III. She is HIV negative and we are doing well with my husband's small income as an ironsmith,” Monica recounts her life story from the last five years in a nutshell. She adds that if it was not for Ashar Alo she would still be forced to live a leper's life in the dark. Monica Das is a general member of AsharProdeep, the first HIV positive organisation for women in Bangladesh.“Ashar Alo Society is an organisation of PLHIV (People Living with HIV), working for those infected with and affected by HIV and AIDS, however few of us HIV positive women felt the need to have a different platform for women only, because there are many women related problems that could not be freely discussed in front of men. Thus Ashar Prodeep, (AP) the first HIV positive organisation for women in Bangladesh was formed,” says Neela Akter, Peer Counsellor and Secretary of AsharProdeep.“Ashar Prodeep started its journey from 2008 as a women's network led by a group of HIV positive women who came together to share information, experiences and enlist support from each other. It has formed a general committee with 35 members and an executive committee of 7 members. AsharProdeep was registered on January 10, 2010 under the Women and Children Affairs Bureau, Bangladesh,” Akter says.Ashar Prodeep seeks to create a stigma and violence – free society, to ensure treatment rights as well as establish basic rights for all PLHIV women and children in Bangladesh. “Increasing access to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment for PLHIV women to reduce HIV morbidity and mortality and make the support more effective through treatment education and empowerment of PLHIV women is the ongoing project of AsharProdeep, along with awareness building on treatment issue and empowerment of PLHIV women,” Akter explained their main purpose.AP also conducts one to one peer counselling, family counselling, spouse counselling and treatment adherence counselling. As a PLHIV women's organisation, Ashar Prodeep is working for HIV infected and affected women and their children in Bangladesh. PLHIV women are still facing stigma, neglect and discrimination at different levels, their needs are being excluded from the development plans of different agencies due to the lack of awareness, limited knowledge on rights based issues, misconceptions about HIV and AIDS, low literacy rates and inappropriate advocacy skills.Ashar Prodeep has been supported by UNICEF from 2012. “Our main focus is to help AP strengthen its organizational capacity in terms of logistics, chalking out guidelines or principles, help in policy development and provide support services for expansion to facilitate the most important part of their job which is counselling, treatment adherence by home advocacy,” says Dr M Ziya Uddin, HIV/AIDS Specialist, UNICEF Bangladesh.“The distraught women do not know about HIV/AIDS and care treatment. They do not receive treatment due to the fear of stigma and discrimination, lack of knowledge and family and social support. They do not speak about their health problems with family members for the fear of being deprived of their husbands' properties. To raise their concerns and provide them with a platform AP started some initial level activities like counselling, training on ARV drug adherence, human rights, gender, networking visits, referral linkages etc.“To strengthen AP's role as a new organisation, it is necessary to ensure good governance for which they need to develop human resoures and develop a financial policy to maintain transparency, develop personal policies and M&E manuals under this programme. AP will also have to organise different training programme and workshops for capacity building to develop their organisation so that they can establish themselves as an independent organisation and raise funds to work for the PLHIV women in Bangladesh,” feels Dr Ziya.Neela Akter is a strong, confident woman. She is HIV positive but that leaves no trace of despair in her. Her strength comes from the fact that she has seen life at its cruellest and she has successfully turned the wheels of her fate and once again she begun to dream of a better future.“My husband was an immigrant worker in Kuwait, I had one son and a shop of my own, I lived with my in-laws and things were going fine until January 2009 when my husband abruptly returned home sick. He did not tell me why he came back but I could see that he frequently became sick with fever, jaundice, diarrhoea. He said he had diabetes for which he was ill. We took him to the hospital but nothing was found wrong with him then finally we went to Suhrawardy where the doctors confirmed he had AIDS. I was nine months pregnant at that time with my daughter and my husband passed away shortly after being diagnosed. My brothers-in-law immediately asked me to get checked and when I tested positive they threw me out of my own house, took away my son, my shop and all my savings. It all happened almost simultaneously. I gave birth to my daughter and half an hour after her birth she was given medicines to protect her from being infected. The medicines continued until she was 18 months old and tested negative. My mother took me in and gave us shelter. I came to AP and found a job here. I got my son back. He is 18 years old now and I got him admitted to the Open University to finish his school finals. I have not looked back ever since,” Akter relates her story.Dedicated as she is Akter's counselling has helped many distraught women like her. It is easy for her to understand their troubles because she has been in their shoes. The stories of Khairun Nahar of Jessore or Nahar Akter of Brahmanbaria or Mahmuda Akter of Mirzapore are all similar. Some got infected by their immigrant worker husbands and some got infected while receiving blood transfusions  during delivery. Their stigma and discrimination, the sordid tales of their lives are all too common for PLHIV. Yet when they all sit together talking about their woes and problems they gather hope from each other to carry on with life. AsharProdeep gives these women the strength and confidence to know that being HIV positive is not the end; proper health care, regular medication and peer support can help them live relatively normal and respectable lives.The writer is Editor, Star Lifestyle.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['organisation', 'infected', 'positive', 'women', 'counselling', 'fear', 'support', 'treatment', 'unknown', 'plhiv', 'akter', 'hiv']","“My in-laws are orthodox and me being HIV positive is like a double jeopardy for me.

Cabinet okays draft law on prevention,The cabinet yesterday approved a proposed law aiming at preventing and controlling communicable diseases in the country.,,2016-05-10T00:00:00+06:00,"The cabinet yesterday approved a proposed law aiming at preventing and controlling communicable diseases in the country.The proposed law titled Communicable Disease Prevention, Control and Elimination Act, 2016 has a provision of jail term and fine for a person who is affected with such a disease but does not undergo medical tests for detection.Briefing reporters after a cabinet meeting at the Secretariat, Cabinet Secretary M Shafiul Alam said the affected persons concerned would also have to be examined in related and specified institutes to detect the types of their diseases.If a patient avoids medical tests to detect presence of diseases considered as transmittable, they would face one-year imprisonment or Tk 2 lakh fine, he added.Alam said one of the goals of the draft law is to protect people from communicable diseases as well as taking proper measures to create mass awareness about germs related diseases like Kala-Azar, HIV, Influenza, Nipah, Ebola and Typhoid.Under the proposed law, a patient or the affected persons would have to be screened and isolated to protect common people from being affected, he observed.Experts have termed the proposed law a “landmark and a milestone.”    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  “It's a landmark decision of the government. With enactment of the law, Bangladesh's health sector will move one step forward,” said Prof Dr AKM Shamsuzzaman, director of Communicable Disease Control of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). He told The Daily Star that communicable diseases would be eliminated more quickly with the implementation of the law.Communicable diseases like malaria, dengue, Filariasis, Kala-azar, all types of influenza, Nipah, HIV, viral hepatitis, among others, would be brought under the legal framework of the law, he added.Prof Shamsuzzaman further said, “We used to face difficulties in dealing with diseases which appear suddenly on any part of the country. With the enactment of the law, the health department will be able to involve other government bodies concerned including the law-enforcement agencies for controlling such outbreaks.”Emerging threats of diseases like Zika and communicable diseases which transmit frequently on bordering areas would be dealt under legal framework, he said, thanking the government for approving the proposed law.The health ministry moved to enact the law in 2014 but couldn't do so due to various bureaucratic tangles, according to insiders.The draft law was prepared in line with and replacing the Bangladesh Malaria Eradication (Repeal) Ordinance, 1977 and the Prevention of Malaria (Special Provisions) Ordinance, they said.As per the proposed law, the authorities concerned will create quarantine facilities for affected persons. The law also creates a scope for the government to take all kinds of assistance from other countries to prevent communicable diseases.16 UNIONS TO BE ADDEDAfter the cabinet meeting, the National Implementation Committee for Administrative Reforms (NICAR) with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair approved the LGRD ministry's proposal to add 16 unions to two Dhaka city corporations, doubling the areas of the capital.With the inclusion of eight unions each to Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), the size of the metropolis would be 270 square kilometres from the existing 129 square kilometres, said the cabinet secretary.He added the decision had been taken in order to provide better civic amenities to the people of these unions.Beraid, Badda, Bhatara, Satarkul, Horirampur, Uttarkhan, Dakkhinkhan and Dumni would be included in DNCC, while Shyampur, Matuail, Demra, Dania, Sarulia, Dakkhingaon, Nasirabad and Manda would be included in DSCC.Alam said the NICAR also approved a proposal to upgrade Karnaphuli Police Station of Patia in Chittagong to a new upazila.It will be the 490th upazila of the country and will be formed with five unions excluded from 22 unions of Patia upazila, he said.Replying to a query at his ministry office, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said they would face no financial burden with the doubling size of the city corporation areas. He added financial position of the two city corporations is quite well off.","['prevention', 'draft', 'unions', 'affected', 'cabinet', 'law', 'okays', 'persons', 'city', 'health', 'proposed', 'diseases', 'communicable']","The cabinet yesterday approved a proposed law aiming at preventing and controlling communicable diseases in the country.

AIDS crisis looming?,"There is a lot of prejudice and coldness out there because most people don't understand the seriousness of the affliction. Presumably, the task before the government is formidable. If AIDS is to be defeated, war must be waged against poverty, ignorance, stigmatisation, violence and promiscuity.",,2003-01-21T00:00:35+06:00,"There is a lot of prejudice and coldness out there because most people don't understand the seriousness of the affliction. Presumably, the task before the government is formidable. If AIDS is to be defeated, war must be waged against poverty, ignorance, stigmatisation, violence and promiscuity.In the 20 years since its effects were first medically recognised, the immunodeficiency virus is thought to have infected almost 60 m people around the world and that number grows by 16,000 a day. Plainly speaking, in human terms HIV is a disaster. Of those 60 m people, more than 22 m have already died of AIDS, the disease it causes without any medical intervention. Shockingly, around 3 m more will die over the next 12. But death caused by AIDS is something that is avoidable than deaths caused by nature. Moreover, AIDS kills predominantly in poor countries, compounding the problem.Almost 70 per cent of new infections and existing cases -- a daunting 28.1 m people -- are in sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS is now cutting 15 years of average life expectancy in this region. According to some estimates, it will slice 8 per cent of national incomes in the worst afflicted countries by 2010. Although a few countries such as Uganda are coming to grips with the disease through education, condom distribution and other preventive measures, lack of money and political will is thwarting efforts elsewhere.But Africa is not alone in its suffering. Eastern Europe now has the world's fastest growing AIDS epidemic, with 2,50,000 new cases in 2001. A projection by Imperial College, London suggests Russia may have 5 m people infected with HIV in five years time, 4 m of them suffering the symptoms of AIDS. Most worrisome, not only sub-Saharan Africa or Eastern Europe and Latin American countries, two of the world's most populous countries China and India are threatened. The Chinese government admits to 1 m infections -- widely regarded as an underestimate. India admits to 4 m.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });  In China, the same old story of downplaying the diseases still goes on. After China's first AIDS victim died in 1985, hospital authorities burned the man's belongings -- and even the furniture he used -- in a bonfire. HIV patients in China and in most of the African countries are facing social ostracism and government indifference. Shockingly true, in 1996, in China, Li Ning 9, a young kid got the affliction because of tainted blood transfusion. His father Li Suijun, a factory worker was fired from his job for his son being diagnosed to be infected with HIV. Many of the country's hospitals and health agencies are still will fully ignoring such grave health issues. To them, HIV was a foreigner's disease. But without effective countermeasures, says UNAIDS, the number of HIV cases in China could skyrocket -- reaching 10 million by 2010. However, the grim fact is: for HIV patients everywhere, contracting the virus evokes feelings of helplessness and isolation. In China, only a few individuals are lucky or well-connected enough to obtain AIDS ""cocktail"" -- a mix of drugs from Western countries that has proved effective in fighting the virus.It's now a common knowledge that by far the worst affected continent is Africa. That is where HIV, leapt the species barrier from chimpanzees to people some 70 years ago. But infection rates are rising, in several cases rapidly, in many Asian countries and in many of the successor states to the Soviet Union. At the moment, the place with the largest number of cases is South Africa.Encouragingly, the mood in Barcelona, Spain where the 14th AIDS Conference was held in the early part of 2002 took stock of the whole situation and agreed to take measures to stop the rot. The conference in the first place agreed to spread the use of condoms. Second, the best way to stop infection in children is to curb mother-to-child transmission with cheap, one-shot drugs given just before birth. Third, empower women to choose freely whether and with whom they have sex, and what sort of contraception they use. Fourth, perhaps above all, educate people about the risks they face. Encouragingly, several countries most notably Uganda, Senegal and Thailand have shown the way to mount steps in that direction.The drug treatment situation has changed much in the meantime. There was a time when the cure was too expensive to be worth considering: a year's course of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) cost $10,000 - 15,000. But now with the emergence of Global AIDS Fund and because of the drug companies ""tiered pricing"" for poorer parts of the world, and due to bilateral donations by the drug firms themselves, the cost per patient is just one dollar a day. But even then it is beyond the purse of most Africans. Only 30,000 people in that continent use it. Only diamond rich Botswana has an official anti-AIDS drug programme in place. Other countries await, fairy ""godmothers"" who will help them pick up the bill. According to estimate made public by Peter Piot, head, UNAIDS and Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General, the ""Global Fund announced will require $ 7 billion -- $Ê10 billion a year, but in practice it has attracted $ 2.1 billion in its first year of existence, chipped in largely from the Gates Foundation along with U.S government funding. A mathematical model developed in 2001 by Bernhard Schwartlander of the World Health Organisation and his colleagues estimated the maximum amount that could be spent usefully per year by 2005 as about $ 9 billion. Of that, $ 4.8 billion would be allocated to prevention, and $ 4.2 billion to treatment. At the moment, according to the Global HIV Prevention Working Group, a group of experts financed by the Gates and Kaiser Foundation, about $ 1.2 billion is spent on prevention in the world's poor countries. In a paper published in the ""Lancet"", another group of experts John Stover of Futures Group International and his colleagues, estimate that increasing spending on prevention to the tune of $ 4.8 billion that Dr. Schwartlander recommended could avoid 29 m infections by 2010 -- if the money were spent well.Strengthening the medical infrastructure of the poorer countries is a vital necessity and obviously it will cost more. The Commission for Macro-economics and Health (CMH), headed by Jeffrey Sachs, a well-known development economist based at Columbia University, reckons that infrastructure development would raise the price to $ 15 billion.The impoverished world have the example of Brazil in front of them, to have a grasp of what a well-organized treatment campaign can achieve in a country that is struggling an economic mess. In the backdrop of the prediction of the World Bank Model that about 1.2 m people in Brazil would be infected with HIV by 2002, effective anti-AIDS fighting campaign was launched. The actual figure is now 600,000. This is in part because 1,50,000 people are on HAART. Since HAART reduces a person's viral load to a negligible level, it helps to curb transmission to others besides maintaining the health of the patient. This treatment was made free at point of use by the Brazilian government in 1996, and as a direct result, the number of people dying of AIDS in Brazil has fallen by 50 per cent.In Bangladesh, tragedy and ruin stare the middle class in the face as the virus that causes AIDS moves beyond the red-light areas. The UNICEF report made public in the early part of December last year revealed that the country has now about 310 under-14 HIV infected children. Although the official figure puts the HIV infected persons at 248, the number has spiraled to 13,000 according to AIDS Epidemic Research Report published by UNAIDS in 2001. Most worrisome, the report adds, each day 6000 children are being infected with HIV in Bangladesh. Perhaps the most worrying aspect is the growing evidence of what HIV experts call ""transmission chains"" by which the virus percolates insidiously through social sub-strata and afflicts low risk individuals like housewives and children.Even in China where authorities viewed community organisations and independent researchers with suspicion, government has woken up. Like China, AIDS awareness classes should now be mandatory in all schools, colleges and universities in Bangladesh. Often the classes are the students' first exposure to sex education -- and other stark facts of life. Volunteers in the class would demonstrate how to sterilize hypodermic needles. Till now 70 percent of HIV cases in this region are spread via needle-sharing by drug users.Experts reason out the rise in HIV cases in the country other than tainted blood transfusion and needle-sharing to dramatic shift in the sexual behaviour of the middle class. Changes in workplace is cited as a major reason. Unemployment situation in the country has spawned a breed of travelling migrant workers who spend nearly half their working lives away from home. At the same time women in the country have become an increasingly visible part of the professional workforce. Put these factors together and you have the settings for an increasing number of casual sexual relationships. Experts further feel that the growing affluence of the middle class and influence of blue films proliferating the homes and clubs of a certain class of people have something to do with changing moral values. While in the West having multiple sexual partners is now considered a ""high risk behaviour"", in our region it has just become fashionable. Undoubtedly true, with pre-marital sex gaining increasing acceptance among the new generation, the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS has risen. Teenagers and those in the early 20s constitute a majority of the cases testing HIV positive. On the other hand, prostitutes these days are not confined to the restricted areas, they are roaming the streets, parks and secluded posh houses and hotels in the cities and towns. Doctors indicate these trends as danger signals.With HIV cases growing alarmingly, Bangladesh's over-burdened and crumbling health system apparently isn't able to cope with the looming epidemic -- not medically, not financially and certainly not emotionally. Some NGOs are quietly working to fill the gap. But there is a lot of prejudice and coldness out there because most people don't understand the seriousness of the affliction. Presumably, the task before the government is formidable. If AIDS is to be defeated, war must be waged against poverty, ignorance, stigmatisation, violence and promiscuity.Md Asadullah Khan, a former teacher of Physics, is Controller of Examination, BUET.","['m', 'infected', 'aids', 'countries', 'china', 'number', 'billion', 'health', 'cases', 'hiv', 'looming', 'crisis']","Most worrisome, not only sub-Saharan Africa or Eastern Europe and Latin American countries, two of the world's most populous countries China and India are threatened.

With HIV cases growing alarmingly, Bangladesh's over-burdened and crumbling health system apparently isn't able to cope with the looming epidemic -- not medically, not financially and certainly not emotionally."
Bangladesh among five nations with rising AIDS,"Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/AIDS infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, despite prevalence rates remaining low in the region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Colombo yesterday.",,2007-08-21T00:00:00+06:00,"Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/AIDS infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, despite prevalence rates remaining low in the region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Colombo yesterday.Over 2,000 officials, experts, healthcare workers and victims have gathered in Colombo for the conference to share their experience in fighting the spread of the disease and treating those who are already infected in the region, which has the second largest number of people affected by HIV in the world, with around 300,000 AIDS-related deaths a year.They will hold around 250 seminars, workshops, sessions and symposiums over five days between August 19 and 23 under the theme of ""Waves of Change, Waves of Hope.""UNAIDS officials yesterday said there are plenty of reasons to worry about AIDS in the region, ""Starkly underlined by the rising number of new infections in countries like China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.""However, other experts and practitioners said Bangladesh still has relatively low prevalence rates, with concentrated cases in Dhaka and three other cities, defying fears that an injected drugs users epidemic would have accelerated the spread of the infection to disastrous levels within 2008.The UNAIDS also observed that political instability directly affects the battle against HIV as programmes face a shortage of funds and treatment services and it becomes harder for people to access health services.Bangladesh has over 50 participants at the conference, a number of them taking part in sessions where they shared their experiences and observations, alongside participants from the region who identified social stigma and ignorance as some of the biggest challenges to preventing AIDS.""The Asia and Pacific region has a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, but the challenge across the countries is to keep the prevalence low,"" Deborah Landey, deputy director of UNAIDS, said at a news briefing before the conference.She also revealed that the prevalence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has come down from 8.3 million to 5.4 million in the region.That number, although considerable, remains far below the number in sub-Saharan Africa, where 25.8 million people are infected.Landey said each country must keep on its toes for new social trends in the spread of the virus, citing the example of rising infections among homosexuals in China.Strong political leadership that does not become complacent over relatively low levels of infection is vital for keeping the disease at bay, she said.Populations traditionally thought to be low-risk, including married women, are becoming more vulnerable, she said.Married women are exposed to becoming infected by their husbands and experts cited to reports from numerous countries, suggesting that more than half of the newly infected people were married women, she said.Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa opened the conference on Sunday.The congress will hold discussions on a range of subjects, including preventing infections among vulnerable groups, treatment of those already infected and eliminating social stigma for victims and their families, the organisers said.    googletag.cmd.push(function() {      googletag.display(""dfp-ad-news_details_after_2nd_paragraph"");    });","['region', 'bangladesh', 'nations', 'infections', 'prevalence', 'infected', 'aids', 'women', 'number', 'countries', 'spread', 'social', 'rising', 'low']","Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/AIDS infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, despite prevalence rates remaining low in the region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Colombo yesterday.
