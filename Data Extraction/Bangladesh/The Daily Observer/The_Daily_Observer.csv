London HIV patient becomes world's second AIDS cure hope,,,None,"London, Mar 5: An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors said.

Almost three years after receiving bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after coming off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the man's previous HIV infection. ""There is no virus there that we can measure. We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man. The case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, the doctors said, but does not mean a cure for HIV has been found. Gupta described his patient as ""functionally cured"" and ""in remission"", but cautioned: ""It's too early to say he's cured.""



The man is being called ""the London patient"", in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV.

Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free.



Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients.

Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called Hodgkin's Lymphoma.



In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him. ""This was really his last chance of survival,"" Gupta told Reuters in an interview.

The donor - who was unrelated - had a genetic mutation known as 'CCR5 delta 32', which confers resistance to HIV.

The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of ""graft-versus-host"" disease - a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipient's immune cells.



Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people - most of them of northern European descent - who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus.



Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key - or whether the graft versus host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said.

Sharon Lewin, an expert at Australia's Doherty Institute and co-chair of the International AIDS Society's cure research advisory board, told Reuters the London case points to new avenues for study. ""We haven't cured HIV, but (this) gives us hope that it's going to be feasible one day to eliminate the virus,"" she said.



Gupta said his team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. ""We need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,"" he said. The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details. -REUTERS","['worlds', 'hiv', 'aids', 'patient', 'gupta', 'man', 'known', 'cure', 'donor', 'virus', 'hope', 'london', 'case', 'doctors', 'second']","We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

HIV used to cure 'bubble boy' disease,,,None,"HIV used to cure 'bubble boy' disease

Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems.

Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants.

The gene therapy involved collecting the babies' bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth.

The ""correct"" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month.

Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, said in a statement: ""These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives.""

""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1,"" she added, referring to the most common type of SCID.

The patients were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco.

What is this syndrome?

The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber.

Nicknamed ""Bubble Boy"", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant.

Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency.

His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born.

What are other treatment options?

Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor. But according to St Jude, more than 80% of these patients lack such donors and must rely on blood stem cells from other donors.

This process is less likely to cure the bubble boy disease, and is more likely to cause serious side effects as a result of treatment.

Previous advancements in gene therapy provided alternatives to a bone marrow transplant, but these treatments sometimes involved chemotherapy and had implications for a range of other diseases, including blood disorders, sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and metabolic syndrome. -BBC

Some Rohingyas with HIV identified,,,None,"Many Rohingya refugee children and adults have been found infected with various contagious diseases including HIV/AIDs, Hepatitis B-C and Tuberculosis; posing serious threat to the health of the locals, experts said.

They also noted that Rohingyas driven out of Myanmar's Arakan State should be confined to a specific area so that this contagious diseases do not spread out.

Talking with different health experts, volunteers, government and non government officials, this correspondent came to know that besides facing many challenges like food, nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation, a good number of children are suffering from measles.

Already different news media reported that till now over 200 Rohingya children have died at Teknaf and Ukhiya upazilas in Cox's Bazar in the last week alone from malnutrition and a lack of medicare.

Of them, many children were suffering from diarrhea, fever, cold and skin diseases.

According to healthcare volunteers, a shortage of baby food and proper care, an inability of weakened mothers to breastfeed properly, and the spread of diseases have been causing these deaths in the Bangladesh-Myanmar border areas.

A 21-year-old Selina Begum who arrived in Cox's Bazar told this correspondent that her baby fell into the Naf river and drowned when the boat collided with another boat on Friday night.

Dr Puchanu, Superintendent of Cox's Bazar Sadar 250 Bed District Sadar Hospital said that a total of 14 patients suffering from infectious diseases were being treated at various hospitals Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Teknaf and Ukhiya.

The measles affected three children were admitted to hospital in Ukhiya, five affected with Hepatitis B and C have been taken to Teknaf for treatment, six infected with tuberculosis were taking treatment at Teknaf and Cox's Bazar and one infected with HIV/AIDs has been removed to Chittagong, he said while talking over phone.

However, a rubella and polio vaccination campaign for 1.5 lakh Rohingya refugee children started in Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas of Cox's Bazar on Saturday morning.

Dr Abdus Salam, Civil Surgeon of Cox's Bazar said all the children, aged between six months and 15 years, will be vaccinated for rubella (measles).

Children below five years will be administered polio vaccines while six-month-old to five-year-old children will be provided vitamin A capsules, the Civil Surgeon said.

When asked about the status of the Rohingya children, he said ""Most of the children we received here are either not vaccinated or poorly vaccinated. So we want a fresh start, he said.

He also confirmed the presence of rubella disease among Rohingya children.

Suman Baruya , Upazila Health and Family Welfare official of Cox's Bazar Sadar 250 Bed District Sadar Hospital noted that about 60 patients were admitted to the Teknaf 50-Bed Hospital. Of them, three are suffering from tuberculosis and jaundice.

Pronab Kumar Chowdhury, Chief of Child Health Department, Chittagong Medical College Hospital said that Myanmar did not provide Rohingyas any treatment facilities.

He also added that the two diseases measles and tuberculosis can spread out in the air through coughing, posing serious health threat to other children and refugees.

He noted that about 112 patients have received treatment from CMCH till August 26. Of them, about 90 people were hit by bullet and rest are burnt patients.

Till now two Rohingya refugees have died during receiving treatment, of them one was hit by bullet.

Besides such contagious diseases Rohingya refuges are also affected with HIV/AIDs diseases, health expert said.

Hafiz Ahmed, Divisional Coordinator of Ashar Alo Society (AAS), a non governmental organization gives HIV/AIDs treatment, said that about 508 patients have been admitted under this society. Of them about 37 are Rohingya refugees, who had been staying here for few years.

But recently one Rohingya refugee was identified as HIV/AIDs carrier, who crossed Myanmar border after August 25 violence.

Prof AQM Sirajul Islam, AIDS specialist, said as the number of Rohingya refugee increases they should be confined to a specific area so that it could be controlled.

However, Health Minister Mohammed Nasim said that Bangladesh government was contributing its best despite its limitation.

""Bangladesh is a small country with huge population. So continuing this aid to Rohingya refugee is difficult. So Myanmar government must take back their citizens,"" he said.

He made this comment during his visit to Rohingya Camp, in Ukhiya's Kutupalong under Cox's Bazar on Saturday.","['diseases', 'hiv', 'hospital', 'treatment', 'refugee', 'rohingyas', 'coxs', 'identified', 'teknaf', 'children', 'rohingya', 'bazar', 'health']","When asked about the status of the Rohingya children, he said ""Most of the children we received here are either not vaccinated or poorly vaccinated.

"HIV's ability to cause AIDS is weakening over time, study finds","Rapid evolution of HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, is slowing its ability to cause AIDS, according to a study of more than 2,000 women in Africa.Scientists said the research suggests a less virulent HIV could be one of several factors contributing to a turning of the deadly pandemic, eventually leading",,2014-12-02 00:00:00,"HIV's ability to cause AIDS is weakening over time, study finds Published : Tuesday, 2 December, 2014, Time : 4:12 PM, View Count : 22 Rapid evolution of HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, is slowing its ability to cause AIDS, according to a study of more than 2,000 women in Africa.



Scientists said the research suggests a less virulent HIV could be one of several factors contributing to a turning of the deadly pandemic, eventually leading to the end of AIDS.

Some 35 million people currently have HIV and AIDS has killed around 40 million people since it began spreading 30 years ago.



But campaigners noted on Monday that for the first time in the epidemic's history, the annual number of new HIV infections is lower than the number of HIV positive people being added to those receiving treatment, meaning a crucial tipping point has been reached in reducing deaths from AIDS.



Goulder's team conducted their study in Botswana and South Africa -- two countries badly hit by AIDS -- where they enrolled more than 2,000 women with HIV.



First they looked at whether the interaction between the body's natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent or able to cause disease.



Previous research on HIV has shown that people with a gene known as HLA-B*57 can benefit from a protective effect against HIV and progress more slowly than usual to AIDS.



The scientists found that in Botswana, HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B*57 more than in South Africa, so patients no longer benefited from the protective effect. But they also found the cost of this adaptation for HIV is a reduced ability to replicate -- making it less virulent.



The scientists then analyzed the impact on HIV virulence of the wide use of AIDS drugs. Using a mathematical model, they found that treating the sickest HIV patients -- whose immune systems have been weakened by the infection -- accelerates the evolution of variants of HIV with a weaker ability to replicate.



""HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate,"" Goulder said. ""Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.""



The study was published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

Talluto's defence lawyers had argued their client's actions were ""imprudent, but not intentional"".



However, those who asked him to wear a condom were told he was either allergic, or had recently been tested for HIV, news agency AFP reported.



When some of the women confronted him after discovering they were infected, he denied he was a carrier of the potentially deadly virus, which can lead to Aids.



As a result of his actions, another four people contracted the virus on top of the women he directly infected: three men and one baby.



Prosecutor Elena Neri told the court last month: ""His actions were intended to sow death.""

Cows could hold key to beating HIV,,,None,"WASHINGTON, July 21: Cows have shown an ""insane"" and ""mind-blowing"" ability to tackle HIV which will help develop a vaccine, say US researchers.

In a first for immunisation, the animals rapidly produced special types of antibody that can neutralise HIV.

It is thought cows evolved a supreme immune defence due to their complex and bacteria-packed digestive system.

The US National Institutes of Health said the findings were of ""great interest"".

HIV is a slippery and nefarious opponent. It mutates so readily that every time a patient's immune system finds a way of attacking the virus, HIV shifts its appearance.

However, a small proportion of patients eventually develop ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" after years of infection. These attack parts the virus cannot change.

A vaccine that could train the immune system to make broadly neutralising antibodies should help prevent people being infected in the first place.

But no jab can do the job.

Then researchers at the International Aids Vaccine Initiative and the Scripps Research Institute tried immunising cows.

""The response blew our minds,"" Dr Devin Sok, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website.

The required antibodies were being produced by the cow's immune system in a matter of weeks.

Dr Sok added: ""It was just insane how good it looked, in humans it takes three-to-five years to develop the antibodies we're talking about.

""This is really important because we hadn't been able to do it period.

""Who would have thought cow biology was making a significant contribution to HIV.""

The results, published in the journal Nature, showed the cow's antibodies could neutralise 20% of HIV strains within 42 days.

By 381 days, they could neutralise 96% of strains tested in the lab.

Dr Dennis Burton, a fellow researcher, said: ""The potent responses in this study are remarkable.

""Unlike human antibodies, cattle antibodies are more likely to bear unique features and gain an edge over HIV.""

Unusually for human antibodies, the broadly neutralising ones have a long and loopy structure. Cow antibodies are inherently more long and loopy.

So the cow immune system finds making the antibodies easily.

It is thought the cow's ""ruminant"" digestive system which ferments grass in order to digest it is a Wild West of hostile bacteria. So the animals have developed the antibodies needed to keep them in check.

It means cattle could eventually become a source of drugs to make more effective vaginal microbicides to prevent HIV infection.

However, the real goal is to develop a vaccine that encourages the human immune system to make the antibodies it currently finds a struggle.

That remains a significant challenge, but the cattle study could help point the way.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: ""From the early days of the epidemic, we have recognized that HIV is very good at evading immunity, so exceptional immune systems that naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV are of great interest - whether they belong to humans or cattle."" —BBC","['thought', 'beating', 'hiv', 'immune', 'antibodies', 'vaccine', 'system', 'develop', 'cattle', 'broadly', 'key', 'hold', 'cows']","It is thought cows evolved a supreme immune defence due to their complex and bacteria-packed digestive system.
It mutates so readily that every time a patient's immune system finds a way of attacking the virus, HIV shifts its appearance.
The required antibodies were being produced by the cow's immune system in a matter of weeks.
The results, published in the journal Nature, showed the cow's antibodies could neutralise 20% of HIV strains within 42 days.
""Unlike human antibodies, cattle antibodies are more likely to bear unique features and gain an edge over HIV."""
Common birth control drug ups risk of HIV,,,None,"Common birth control drug ups risk of HIV



Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is an injectable birth control shot administered every three months, which prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens the mucous layer around the cervix to block sperm from getting through.



According to researchers, transitioning away from DMPA could help protect women from becoming infected with HIV.



Human studies suggest DMPA use may raise the risk of HIV infection by 40 percent.



The findings suggest other forms of birth control should rapidly replace DMPA shots, the researchers noted.



The team wanted to review the underlying biological mechanisms that could contribute to increased risk of HIV infection for certain hormonal contraceptives but not others.



""To protect individual and public health, it is important to ensure women in areas with high rates of HIV infection have access to affordable contraceptive options,"" said first study author Janet P. Hapgood from the University of Cape Town in South Africa.



""Increasing availability of contraceptives that use a different form of the female hormone progestin than the one found in DMPA could help reduce the risk of HIV transmission,"" Hapgood added.



The team examined animal, cell and biochemical research on the form of progestin used in DMPA - medroxprogesterone acetate, or MPA.



MPA is used in birth control and as part of menopausal hormone therapy.



The analysis revealed MPA acts differently than other forms of progestin used in contraceptives.



MPA behaves like the stress hormone cortisol in the cells of the genital tract that can come in contact with HIV.



The researchers explained that the increased rate of HIV infection among women using DMPA contraceptive shots is likely due to multiple reasons, including decreases in immune function and the protective barrier function of the female genital tract.

People with HIV living longer: Study,"PARIS, July 18 : HIV-positive people in the world's rich countries now live nearly as long as those who don't carry the AIDS-causing virus, as drugs have cut the overall death rate in half, researchers said on Friday.Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) has cut the death rate from about 18 per 1,000 people between 1999 and 2001 to nine per 1,000 per",,2014-07-19 00:00:00,"PARIS, July 18 : HIV-positive people in the world's rich countries now live nearly as long as those who don't carry the AIDS-causing virus, as drugs have cut the overall death rate in half, researchers said on Friday.

Anti-retroviral treatment (ART) has cut the death rate from about 18 per 1,000 people between 1999 and 2001 to nine per 1,000 per year in 2009-2011, according to data from 200 clinics in Europe, the United States and Australia.

""These findings provide further evidence of the substantial net benefits of ART,"" said a study published in The Lancet medical journal. ""With the advent of effective anti-retroviral treatment, the life expectancy for people with HIV is now approaching that seen in the general population.""

Developed in the mid-1990s, ART drug combinations do not kill the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), but slow its development into full-blown AIDS.

Before the advent of ARTs, which have to be taken for life, people who contracted the virus generally died after a few years, mainly from opportunistic infections and cancers taking advantage of the lowered immune defences.

The study of 50,000 HIV-positive adults found that complications of AIDS, the final immune-compromised stage of infection, were still the most common death cause, at 29 percent. This was followed by non-AIDS cancers -- mainly lung cancer -- at 15 percent, liver disease with 13 percent and cardiovascular disease with 11 percent.

A decline in deaths among HIV-positive people from liver and cardiovascular disease may be due to generally healthier lifestyles -- less smoking and drinking, or the use of less toxic ARTs, said the study.

The reasons for a slight increase in non-AIDS cancers, however, were unclear.

""It is very encouraging that death rates are continuing to decrease among HIV-positive people.

Fighting the HIV Aids infection in Bangladesh may face a huge challenge in future due to resource constraints according to a leading NGO, as it called for expanded coverage and quality interventions for the people who are at highest risk of HIV.

""Although HIV-infected cases have been reduced in Bangladesh, there are some certain groups who are vulnerable to HIV and there is a chance of their spreading it. But we have no adequate resources or funds to address these groups,"" deputy director of Save the Children Sheikh Masudul Alam told a press briefing on Saturday.

Citing a UNAIDS report, he said Bangladesh spent US$ 19.4 million on the AIDS response in 2014, with only US$ 2.9 million of the total expenditure coming from domestic resources.

In 2014, Masudul Alam said, an estimated 138 mothers needed the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) services, but only 25 mothers received the service, which amounted to just 18 percent of mothers needing PMTCT services.

For lack of resources, around 63 children were infected with HIV in 2014 due to the mother to child transmission, he added.

National AIDS/STD Programme under the Health Ministry, The Global Fund, Save the Children and Dhaka Ahsania Mission jointly organised the media briefing at Ahsania Mission office in the capital ahead of the World AIDS Day to be observed on December 1.

Making his presentation, Masudul Alam said globally 36.9 million people are living with HIV and new HIV infections among adults and children were estimated at 2 million in 2014, a 35 percent decline since 2000.

In Bangladesh in 2014, it was estimated that 8,900 people were living with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, while 433 were reportedly infected in 2014. Some 563 deaths occurred last year due to the disease.

""In 2014, it was estimated that 309 children (aged 0-14 years) were living with HIV. The children have been infected mainly by mother to child transmission,"" he said.

UNAIDS data showed that 799 'young people' were living with HIV in Bangladesh in 2014. The reported number of new cases of HIV in 2014 among this group was 58. Women accounted for 30 percent of newly reported cases.

Masudul Alam said HIV is more prevalent among those who inject drugs, migrant workers, sex workers, male homosexuals and members of the transgender community in the country.

""HIV-affected people easily fall prey to tuberculosis (TB) as their immune system is disabled. TB is still a health burden to us. Screening is required in this regard,"" he said.

Director General of Press Institute of Bangladesh (PIB) Mohammad Shah Alamgir Hossain, Dhaka Ahsania Mission president Kazi Rafiqul Alam and its deputy director Iqbal Masud also spoke the press briefing.

The speakers urged the mass media to play their role to create awareness among people about HIV/AIDS for prevention of the deadly disease and thus saving people from dangerous consequences.

They said community-based HIV prevention and treatment as well as interventions involving marginalised groups need to be scaled up and made available to hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups.

Stressing the need for increasing financial allocation for successful HIV prevention programmes, the speakers said target groups need special attention and they should be provided with necessary services. ?UNB","['alam', 'living', 'hiv', 'fight', 'million', 'prevention', 'groups', 'estimated', 'natl', 'transmission', 'children', 'bangladesh', 'menace', 'resources', 'needed']","For lack of resources, around 63 children were infected with HIV in 2014 due to the mother to child transmission, he added.

HIV home test kit goes on sale in UK,"The first legally approved HIV self-test kit that allows people to get a result in 15 minutes at home has gone on sale in England, Scotland and Wales.Unlike other kits, these tests do not need to be sent off to a lab to get the results.It works by detecting antibodies",,2015-04-29 00:00:00,"HIV home test kit goes on sale in UK Published : Wednesday, 29 April, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 15

The first legally approved HIV self-test kit that allows people to get a result in 15 minutes at home has gone on sale in England, Scotland and Wales.

Unlike other kits, these tests do not need to be sent off to a lab to get the results.

It works by detecting antibodies on a small drop of blood, which are often only detectable three months after the infection is caught.

Experts warn that any positive tests must be reconfirmed at clinics.

Charities hope it will reduce some of the 26,000 people estimated to have undiagnosed HIV in the UK. An early diagnosis allows people to get treatment quickly and can prevent serious complications. And individuals successfully treated for HIV are less likely to pass the infection on.

This new 'do-it-yourself' test is made by company Bio Sure UK and can be bought online.

It works in a similar way to a pregnancy test, measuring levels of antibodies - proteins made in response to the virus - in a person's blood.

The device analyses a small droplet of blood, taken from the finger-tip using a lancet. Two purple lines appear if it is positive.

The first legally approved HIV self-test kit that allows people to get a result in 15 minutes at home has gone on sale in England, Scotland and Wales.Unlike other kits, these tests do not need to be sent off to a lab to get the results.It works by detecting antibodies on a small drop of blood, which are often only detectable three months after the infection is caught.Experts warn that any positive tests must be reconfirmed at clinics.Charities hope it will reduce some of the 26,000 people estimated to have undiagnosed HIV in the UK.

Forgotten antibody 'keeps away' HIV,,,None,"NEW YORK, July 25: A group of scientists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute have zeroed in on a new defense against HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS. Led by Ruth Ruprecht, M.D., Ph.D., the team used an animal model to show for the first time that an antibody called Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was effective in preventing infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure. Worldwide, an estimated 90% of new cases of HIV-1 are caused through exposure in the mucosal cavities like the inside lining of the rectum or vagina.



""IgM is sort of the forgotten antibody,"" Dr. Ruprecht, Scientist and Director of Texas Biomed's AIDS Research Program, said. ""Most scientists believed its protective effect was too short-lived to be leveraged as any kind of protective shield against an invading pathogen like HIV-1.""

The study is published in the July 17, 2018 edition of the journal AIDS. The article is listed as ""Fast Track,"" indicating these new and exciting data should get special attention.



Rhesus monkeys at the Southwest National Primate Research Center on the Texas Biomed campus served as models for the in vivo study. Scientists first treated the animals with a man-made version of IgM, which is naturally produced by plasma cells located under the epithelium (the surface lining of body cavities). Half an hour later, the same animals were exposed to SHIV (simian-human immunodeficiency virus). Four out of the six animals treated this way were fully protected against the virus. The animals were monitored for 82 days.



Dr. Ruprecht's team found that applying the IgM antibodies resulted in what is called immune exclusion. IgM clumped up the virus, preventing it from crossing the mucosal barrier and spreading to the rest of the body. The technique of introducing pre-formed antibodies into the body to create immunity is known as passive immunization.



IgM has a high affinity for its antigens and ""grabs them very quickly and does not let go,"" Dr. Ruprecht explained. ""Our study reveals for the first time the protective potential of mucosal anti-HIV-1 IgM. IgM has a five-times higher ability to bind to virus particles compared to the standard antibody form called IgG. It basically opens up a new area of research. IgM can do more than it has been given credit.""



An accompanying editorial says Dr. Ruprecht has ""set off a new wave in evaluating the activity of IgM antibodies in neutralizing HIV-1...[and she and her group] have largely broadened the horizon of neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies, which, as single or combined agents, may be used for HIV-1 prevention and treatment.""



This investigation used resources that were supported by the Southwest National Primate Research Center grant P51 OD011133 from the Office of Research Infrastructure Programs, National Institutes of Health. -IANS","['mucosal', 'keeps', 'antibody', 'forgotten', 'hiv', 'ruprecht', 'aids', 'used', 'research', 'antibodies', 'igm', 'virus', 'hiv1', 'animals', 'away']","Led by Ruth Ruprecht, M.D., Ph.D., the team used an animal model to show for the first time that an antibody called Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was effective in preventing infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure.

'BD leading the battle against HIV,Health Minister Mohammed Nasim on Tuesday said that Bangladesh has been a global pioneer in AIDS prevention.,,2016-03-16 00:00:00,"'BD leading the battle against HIV/AIDS in Asia Pacific region' Banani Mallick Published :Wednesday, 16 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 32 Health Minister Mohammed Nasim on Tuesday said that Bangladesh has been a global pioneer in AIDS prevention.

""We will protect our citizens from HIV and we will make Bangladesh AIDs-free and remain an example for Asia Pacific region as well as the world,"" he made this comment while talking with the Daily Observer over phone just after the concluding day of the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia Pacific region.

Bangladesh government has taken different steps for raising awareness on AIDS and support programmes in 1985 when the first HIV case was reported.

About 2500 delegates from 56 countries accounting for 70 percent of world's population attended at the ICAAP12

Alongside Scientific and Academic Tracks, huge representation from the AIDS Community affected by AIDS which included PLHAs (People Living with HIV/AIDS); CSWs (Commercial Sex Workers); LG BT(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexuals and Transgender people); MSMs(Men having Sex with Men); and IDUs( Injecting Drug Users) were present in the conference.

Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith was present as chief guest at the closing session in the conference and said that human life is very precious and people should nurture it any cost.

55 AIDS patients among fresh influx of Rohingyas identified,,,None,"The Health Department of Cox's Bazar have identified and isolated 55 AIDS (HIV) patients for treatment among the Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar in the face of arson and gun attacks by Myanmar army and Buddhist monks recently.

Around 610,000 Rohingyas have so far crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar. Bangladesh is now at a high risk of HIV outbreak anytime, experts say.

Separate teams are working in Ukhiya and Teknaf to identify AIDS patients and to isolate them for treatment.

The Health Department is worried about the number of AIDS (HIV) patients, as the real figure might be higher than the figure touted.

Doctors say they believe that there may be more AIDS patients among the Rohingyas as Myanmar's position on the risk list of countries with AIDS patients is very high.

There are more than 250,000 AIDS patients in the country. They said that if the people with AIDS are not immediately identified and isolated then this disease can spread in Bangladesh.

The government has been giving all out support to the displaced Rohingya people and providing them shelter on humanitarian ground.

Cox's Bazar Civil Surgeon's office said it had provided medical treatment to people affected by various diseases, including HIV positive patients.

It is learned that on September 16, two women who came to Kutupalong Camp in Ukhiya were reported to be HIV positive. After that, four more women from the camp were told to be HIV positive.

One out of the six HIV positive patients died. The other five people are being treated at Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital.

‘Dangerous complacency’ to global HIV epidemic risks resurgence,,,None,"‘Dangerous complacency’ to global HIV epidemic risks resurgence

Experts said a stalling of HIV funding in recent years was endangering efforts to control the illness.

As things stand, the world is no longer on course to end the pandemic by 2030 - a target agreed by UN member states, say experts in The Lancet.

They call for urgent changes in how the disease is treated and controlled.

About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids. And there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year.

New cases of HIV/Aids have been falling in recent years.

But the Lancet Commission said the fall was happening too slowly to reach the UNAids target of 500,000 new infections by 2020.

While HIV rates were falling overall, they remained persistent in marginalised groups, younger people - particularly women - and in developing countries, all of whom were less likely to access treatment, the commission said.

Experts said HIV funding had remained flat in recent years, at about £14.7bn - roughly £5.4bn short of the estimated amount needed to achieve the UNAids targets.

Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International Aids Society and professor at University of Cape Town, South Africa, said: ""Despite the remarkable progress of the HIV response, the situation has stagnated in the past decade.

""Reinvigorating this work will be demanding - but the future health and wellbeing of millions of people require that we meet this challenge.""

The Lancet Commission also called for more collaboration between health professionals and for HIV treatment to become better incorporated into other areas of healthcare.

This would mean an end to HIV ""exceptionalism"", where specific funding and services have been provided for HIV alone, and could include combining HIV screening with screening for other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

In India, for example, if HIV testing and treatments were combined with those for syphilis among women sex workers and gay men it could reduce the number of new HIV cases at a national-level by 7% between 2018 and 2028, the report estimated.

""Health systems must be designed to meet the needs of the people they serve, including having the capacity to address multiple health problems simultaneously,"" Prof Chris Beyrer said.

In 2002, when the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced its HIV prevention programme in India with a grant of $100 million, the Health Ministry accused it of being alarmist. Yet, according to Naco's estimate at the time, 4.8 million Indians were HIV positive. The number of AIDS orphans, at more than 2 million, was the largest in the world. A health crisis of epidemic proportions was being predicted. Yet, by 2009, there were concrete signs of reversal, and today India's HIV positive population is estimated to have come down to 2.1 million.

This book by Ashok Alexander, in charge of the Gates' Avahan programme, gives a sense of the challenges facing those working to contain the spread of HIV. The first part is a collection of impressions, largely from field trips he took to map and understand the risk groups. The vulnerable included injection based drug users, transgender persons, the group of MSM and truck drivers, but mostly the sizeable population of female sex workers.

The unorganised nature of sex work and their victimisation by the police, society, family and clients turned out to be a large hindrance in the HIV programme.

In India, only about 7% of sex work takes place from brothels; mostly, it is practised from homes and in the streets, these sex workers forming an ""invisible majority"" of those who had to be reached out to.

Hence, the Thai government's successful intervention in the 1990s to create awareness about HIV prevention and stop unprotected sex work was difficult to replicate here; ""large, well-regulated, legal brothels are a boon for HIV prevention,"" Alexander finds out.

The other challenge came from sex workers themselves. Insisting on clients using condoms could deprive them of their meagre earnings and expose them to violence; in a daily struggle for survival, the risk of HIV was intangible.

Avahan funded NGOs across States with high HIV prevalence - Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Manipur and Nagaland. Where the work involved sex workers, the issue was to get these dispersed people together.

Alexander recounts the complexity through the experience of Ashodaya in Mysuru, which mobilised the sex worker community into running the programme. They had to first build trust by providing them what they needed most: security, and not just from physical violence and police harassment. Crucial was a safe place to meet, and a clinic of their own they could visit without being stigmatised. It was a successful experiment that still continues.

HIV prevention clearly requires a multi-faceted approach, and Alexander's book recognises, above all, the contribution of sex workers in one of India's biggest public health success.

Transgender migrant 'killed' by US,,,None,"Transgender migrant 'killed' by US



Human rights campaigners have accused the US of ""institutional murder"" after a transgender immigrant died in US custody while seeking asylum.

Roxana Hernandez, 33, was being held by immigration authorities in New Mexico when she fell ill.



The US says the Honduran, who was HIV positive, is the sixth person to die in an immigrant detention facility in the past eight months.



She had travelled in a migrant caravan disparaged by President Donald Trump.



Friends say Ms Hernandez had fled violence, hate and stigma in Central America.



""She saw in the United States the opportunity to start a new life free of abuse, risk and threats,"" said a statement issued by a coalition of immigrants' rights groups.



After applying for asylum at the US border, Ms Hernandez was detained for deportation, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said, citing previous convictions in Texas for theft, prostitution and illegally entering the country.



According to ICE, Ms Hernandez was ""processed as an expedited removal"" when she applied for admission at the San Ysidro port of entry in California on 9 May.



Six days later, on 15 May, she was transferred to the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico.



Two days after that, on 17 May, she was admitted to Cibola General Hospital ""with symptoms of pneumonia, dehydration and complications associated with HIV"".



She died early in the morning of 25 May having been transferred to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque by air ambulance.



The preliminary cause of death was given as ""cardiac arrest."" A post-mortem examination is to be carried out.



""Roxy died due to medical negligence by US immigration authorities,"" said the three immigrant groups - Pueblo Sin Fronteras, Al Otro Lado and Diversidad Sin Fronteras - adding: ""In other words, she was murdered.""



The campaigners released a statement from a fellow detainee, who wanted to be known only as Stacy, alleging that her friend had fallen ill when she was locked up for five days in a notoriously cold holding cell known as an ice box.



Stacy claimed that Ms Hernandez was refused access to a doctor despite coughing, vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea and severe pain all over her body.



""The ICE officials yelled at her"" because she was sick, Stacy was quoted as saying. ""She didn't get medical care until she arrived at Cibola.""



According to the organisers, Ms Hernandez was one of at least 267 members of the migrant caravan, including 23 transgender people, who crossed the border into California to apply for asylum.



The immigrants' rights groups are calling for dignified and humane treatment for all asylum seekers, medical care sensitive to the needs of transgender people and those with HIV, and the closure of all immigration detention centres.



ICE said Ms Hernandez was the sixth detainee to die in its custody since 1 October 2017.



In a statement the agency said ""the appropriate"" authorities had been notified about the death along with the consulate of Honduras in Houston, Texas, which, ICE said, would attempt to notify her next of kin.



Stacy said she feared she would be next.



""Because of what happened, I feel bad and am afraid that the same could happen to me, since I have HIV,"" her statement concluded.



Earlier this month, a 20-year old indigenous Guatemalan woman, Gomez Gonzalez, was shot dead in Texas by a US border patrol officer who said a group of migrants rushed towards him.

Roxana Hernandez, 33, was being held by immigration authorities in New Mexico when she fell ill.The US says the Honduran, who was HIV positive, is the sixth person to die in an immigrant detention facility in the past eight months.She had travelled in a migrant caravan disparaged by President Donald Trump.Friends say Ms Hernandez had fled violence, hate and stigma in Central America.""She saw in the United States the opportunity to start a new life free of abuse, risk and threats,"" said a statement issued by a coalition of immigrants' rights groups.After applying for asylum at the US border, Ms Hernandez was detained for deportation, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said, citing previous convictions in Texas for theft, prostitution and illegally entering the country.According to ICE, Ms Hernandez was ""processed as an expedited removal"" when she applied for admission at the San Ysidro port of entry in California on 9 May.Six days later, on 15 May, she was transferred to the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico.Two days after that, on 17 May, she was admitted to Cibola General Hospital ""with symptoms of pneumonia, dehydration and complications associated with HIV"".She died early in the morning of 25 May having been transferred to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque by air ambulance.The preliminary cause of death was given as ""cardiac arrest."" A post-mortem examination is to be carried out.""Roxy died due to medical negligence by US immigration authorities,"" said the three immigrant groups - Pueblo Sin Fronteras, Al Otro Lado and Diversidad Sin Fronteras - adding: ""In other words, she was murdered.""The campaigners released a statement from a fellow detainee, who wanted to be known only as Stacy, alleging that her friend had fallen ill when she was locked up for five days in a notoriously cold holding cell known as an ice box.Stacy claimed that Ms Hernandez was refused access to a doctor despite coughing, vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea and severe pain all over her body.""The ICE officials yelled at her"" because she was sick, Stacy was quoted as saying. ""She didn't get medical care until she arrived at Cibola.""According to the organisers, Ms Hernandez was one of at least 267 members of the migrant caravan, including 23 transgender people, who crossed the border into California to apply for asylum.The immigrants' rights groups are calling for dignified and humane treatment for all asylum seekers, medical care sensitive to the needs of transgender people and those with HIV, and the closure of all immigration detention centres.ICE said Ms Hernandez was the sixth detainee to die in its custody since 1 October 2017.In a statement the agency said ""the appropriate"" authorities had been notified about the death along with the consulate of Honduras in Houston, Texas, which, ICE said, would attempt to notify her next of kin.Stacy said she feared she would be next.""Because of what happened, I feel bad and am afraid that the same could happen to me, since I have HIV,"" her statement concluded.","['ms', 'immigration', 'hiv', 'days', 'authorities', 'hernandez', 'medical', 'statement', 'ice', 'killed', 'migrant', 'transgender']","Transgender migrant 'killed' by USHuman rights campaigners have accused the US of ""institutional murder"" after a transgender immigrant died in US custody while seeking asylum.
Friends say Ms Hernandez had fled violence, hate and stigma in Central America.
According to ICE, Ms Hernandez was ""processed as an expedited removal"" when she applied for admission at the San Ysidro port of entry in California on 9 May.
Stacy claimed that Ms Hernandez was refused access to a doctor despite coughing, vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea and severe pain all over her body.
According to the organisers, Ms Hernandez was one of at least 267 members of the migrant caravan, including 23 transgender people, who crossed the border into California to apply for asylum."

AIDS prevalence in BD still low but vulnerability high: Experts,,,None,"Bangladesh is being considered a low prevalence country in terms of HIV/AIDS but it remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic given its dire poverty, experts say.

Many experts noted that injecting drug users are still the dangerous source of spreading such infection.

All these issues will be discussed in the upcoming 22nd International AIDS Conference 2018 scheduled to be held on 23rd July, a five-day programme, in the Netherland's capital Amsterdam.

The theme of AIDS 2018 is 'Breaking Barriers, Building Bridges' is drawing attention to the need of rights-based approaches to more effectively reach key populations, including in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the North-African/Middle Eastern regions where epidemics are growing.

The number is much higher in female injecting drug users than male including commercial sex workers is posing serious risks to the life of the young generation.

Pulock Raha, an expert of Unicef, said Bangladesh is still considered to be a low prevalence country in regards of HIV/ AIDs.

""Bangladesh is in the unique position to succeed to keep the AIDS epidemic from expanding. He also noted that the success behind this mission is taking comprehensive and strategically viable preventive measures.""

He also noted that the migrant workers are an important group which should be prioritized in the Bangladesh National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS. The first case of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh was detected in 1989. Since then 1495 cases of HIV/AIDS have been reported (as of December 2008).

However UNAIDS estimates that the number of people living with HIV in the country may be as high as 12,000, which is within the range of the low estimate by UNICEF's State of the World's Children Report 2009.

The overall prevalence of HIV in Bangladesh is less than 1%. However, high levels of HIV infection have been found among injecting drug users (7% in one part of the capital city, Dhaka1 ).

But other experts said Bangladesh remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic given its dire poverty, overpopulation, gender inequality and high levels of transactional sex.

Zia Ahmed, a HIV/ AIDS expert, said due to limited access to voluntary counseling and testing services very few Bangladeshis are aware of their HIV status. He suggested the mass awareness is very much needed for preventing such trend.

He also noted that injecting drug users, sex workers and men having sex with men are considered most at-risk groups to HIV infection in Bangladesh.

The latest report conducted by UNAIDS suggests Bangladesh stands at the tenth position in HIV deaths among Asian countries.

The report suggests that Bangladesh lost around 1,000 people in 2016 due to AIDs, says the report.

India has the highest number of deaths in Asia as per the report. The disease claimed 62,000 lives in India the same year.

The report also reveals a worrying fact that in the case of Bangladesh about 68 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) felt ashamed and 54 percent felt guilty due to their HIV-positive status.

AIDS 2018 aims to promote human rights based and evidence-informed HIV responses that are tailored to the needs of particularly vulnerable communities -- including people living with HIV, displaced populations, men who have sex with men, people in closed settings, people who use drugs, sex workers, transgender people, women and girls and young people--and collaborate in fighting the disease beyond country borders.","['prevalence', 'vulnerability', 'aids', 'experts', 'hiv', 'noted', 'low', 'users', 'high', 'sex', 'report', 'workers', 'bangladesh', 'bd', 'men', 'injecting']","Bangladesh is being considered a low prevalence country in terms of HIV/AIDS but it remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic given its dire poverty, experts say.

Between India and Africa's health,"At last month's India-Africa summit in Delhi, Prime Minister Modi met 54 African heads of state to discuss ways of deepening economic and security relationships between these countries.

Also on the agenda was public health, with the two sides exploring how to work together to improve healthcare.

For India, pharmaceuticals remain one of its main exports to Africa, making up around 16 per cent of total exported items, with India supplying 85 per cent of all of anti-retroviral drugs used to treat HIV. African ministers, meanwhile, are keen to learn from and follow India's success in developing a powerhouse drug manufacturing sector, both to secure their own medicine supplies and to give their economies a fillip. It is encouraging to see lower and middle-income countries, like India and those in Africa, taking charge of their own human and economic development priorities, without intervention from the West, and India can certainly be proud of its role in driving down the cost of HIV treatment in Africa and elsewhere through its supply of cheap drugs.

It would be unwise, however, to assume that what has worked for HIV will work for all the other myriad health problems faced by India and the African nations. HIV has been singled out for attention by Western governments, who have poured billions of dollars into building up the health infrastructure required to treat patients, in addition to paying for a large proportion of the (largely Indian made) anti-retroviral drugs currently relied on by African patients.

These days, outside a handful of sub-Saharan African countries, like South Africa, HIV/AIDS is only a small part of the disease landscape in developing countries, constituting only 3.1 per cent of all deaths (0.77 per cent in India). Far more people die from heart disease, stroke and lung disease. Amongst the poorest in African countries, and also in India easily treatable diseases, such as diarrhoea, remain a leading cause of death. India manufactures vast quantities of cheap medicines that could slash death rates for these diseases across Africa and India. The sad reality is that these medicines are simply not getting to those who need them, both at home and abroad.

India itself, home to 3,000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 drugs factories, struggles to make even the most basic medicines available to its citizens. One recent survey showed that in New Delhi, essential medicines are available in only a quarter of state-government facilities, which are the primary source of free medicines for a majority of India's low-income population. Things are equally bleak across sub-Saharan Africa where clinics and pharmacies frequently fail to stock basic medicines such as antibiotics.

Then there is the question of affordability. Even the cheapest off-patent medicines are unaffordable to the majority of people in India and Africa. A single asthma inhaler can cost 50 days' wages in Mozambique, while in India it can cost 2.3 days wages for the lowest paid government worker.

These prices are unaffordable to most people, compounded by long-term failures by African and the Indian states to create workable health insurance models. These failures lead to 63 million Indians sinking into poverty each year as a result of healthcare costs, something that rarely happens in OECD countries. Even if medicines are provided for free, it means little if the health infrastructure is not there to deliver them. There are only 0.7 physicians per 1000 population in India, well below the 3 to 4 seen in most high-income countries. Things are even worse in Africa: most countries don't record data but in Zambia and Zimbabwe, two countries that do, the figure is 0.2 and 0.1 respectively.

These are terrible statistics that are unlikely to improve while governments spend so little on health. In 2001, 189 African governments committed to spending 15 per cent of total government expenditure on health, the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Only Rwanda, Botswana, Zambia and Togo have met this commitment, whereas 19 Africa countries actually now spend less. India, meanwhile, only spends a dismal 4.3 per cent of government expenditure on health - nowhere near enough. But to truly improve healthcare in India and Africa, there needs to be much greater focus on the basics - recruiting and training staff, building infrastructure, working on pharmaceutical supply chains, committing funds and ensuring people have some form of insurance.r

Change perception about AIDS patients: President,President Abdul Hamid on Saturday underscored the need for changing the public perception and broadening the line of thinking about AIDS patients as many such victims are being neglected socially.,,2016-03-12 00:00:00,"Change perception about AIDS patients: President Observer Online Desk Published :Saturday, 12 March, 2016, Time : 5:58 PM View Count : 18 President Abdul Hamid on Saturday underscored the need for changing the public perception and broadening the line of thinking about AIDS patients as many such victims are being neglected socially.



""AIDS is not a curse. It’s a serious public health issue. But many people infected with AIDS are being neglected by society…it’s not deserving. We need to change the public perception and broaden our thinking process,"" he said.



The President said this while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) organised by Health and Family Welfare Ministry, Bangladesh and Partners in Population and Development (PPD) at International Convention City, Bashundhara.



ICAAP has been playing a pivotal role in raising public awareness, building political commitment, strengthening advocacy networks and disseminating knowledge and experiences on HIV issues among stakeholders in the region since its first congress in 1990.



President Hamid said, ""We need further attention to find out HIV patients who are living in disguise because they seem to become a serious threat since they may spread HIV among more people.""



It is time for the removal of discrimination, stigmatisation and ostracizing then people living with HIV/AIDS, observed Hamid adding that the plight of AIDS widows, AIDS orphans or for that matter children and spouses of people living with AIDS is very challenging.



""They’re marginalised to the brims of society. It is appalling to see that it is happening in an age which boasts of pushing the boundaries of science and technology to newer levels. Inter planetary travel seems easy, but looking inwards into our own selves is tough,"" the President noted.





About Bangladesh, President Hamid said the country has realised the importance of community resilience as a key factor in combating HIV/AIDS epidemic very early.



""We’ve made a significant progress in mitigating the spread of HIV but there’s no place for complacency. No society can be safe till all its members follow the simple rules that are essentially knowledge-based and behaviour-driven,"" Hamid added.



Observing that Bangladesh is not a high-risk country if go by statistics, he said but considering the complexity of viral

transmission, Bangladesh has accorded the highest priority to containing HIV transmission in the country as many of Bangladeshi young people are setting sail for overseas jobs around the globe every year.



""Therefore, we cannot allow any Bangladeshi citizen to fall victim to HIV. Not only for Bangladeshi, but also for the entire humanity we don’t want to leave anyone behind. Everyone should count,"" the President insisted.

"Thrust on monitoring, awareness of Hepatitis-C spread","Experts noted that like HIV, people could be infected with deadly Hepatitis -C through blood transfusion and sexual contact too, therefore it has become more risky for the Injecting Drug Users (IDU).This was revealed at an advocacy meeting on 'Importance of HIV and Hepatitis-C co-infection services for the IDUs,' organised",,2015-06-25 00:00:00,"Thrust on monitoring, awareness of Hepatitis-C spread Staff Correspondent Published : Thursday, 25 June, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 37 Experts noted that like HIV, people could be infected with deadly Hepatitis -C through blood transfusion and sexual contact too, therefore it has become more risky for the Injecting Drug Users (IDU).

This was revealed at an advocacy meeting on 'Importance of HIV and Hepatitis-C co-infection services for the IDUs,' organised by Light House Bangladesh, a leading National non government organization in the capital city on Wednesday.

The experts told the meeting that in the developing countries the HIV/Hepatitis C virus co-infection epidemic is growing day by day but scopes are very limited to prevent these.

Referring to the present attitudes towards drug use, health experts noted that addressing harm reduction is crucial and engaging more people with Hep-C message like prevention, diagnosis and treatment is needed.

Biman Kumar Saha, Additional Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, attended as Chief guest while Dr. Safiqul Islam, Line Director, National AIDS/ STD Programme (NASP), chaired the meeting.

Biman Kumar said that economic progress was not possible keeping a nation ill, therefore participation of all sections of people was very important for creating mass awareness against HIV/ Hep-C.

He also requested Shafiqul Islam, Line Director of NASP, to update him on future planning in discussion with Commutation Disease Control (CDC) personnel.

Biman Saha stated that he will cooperate in every aspect of the programme and suggested Light House Bangladesh to conduct follow up meetings as well.

He also sought to raise the issue in the upcoming meeting of Sector Program Planning which is going to take place today.

Ezazul Islam Chowdhury, Senior Programme Manager of ICDDRB, presented a study on Hepatitis-C focusing on the importance of Hep-C service integration and current scenario of Bangladesh.

The study shows that the prevalence of Hep - C among the IDUs of Chapai Nawabganj and Kansat was a major concern amid unavailability of Hep-C service in Bangladesh country programme.

Stressing on prevention of blood borne deadly viruses, other experts and participants said that that in perspective of Bangladesh health systems it need to be supported and provide Hep-C treatment regardless of cost.

The meeting recommended adding the issue in the upcoming sector program support.

Line Director - NASP also expressed his interest and commitment to cooperate to integrate the issue in the sector program.

Rashid, Chief Executive, Light House Bangladesh also suggested a regular surveillance is needed to detect the exact number of Hep-C patients.

Beside Melisa John, Director of Population Health Nutrition and Education of - USAID and different development partners, GO/NGO representatives participated the meeting.

GENEVA, May 19 : Global life expectancy increased by five years between 2000 and 2015, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, crediting progress in Africa against HIV, AIDS and malaria.

The gains made over the last 15 years are the largest since the 1960s, when the world -- especially Europe and Japan -- saw broad socio-economic improvements linked to the recovery from World War II, WHO said.

On average, a child born in 2015 can expect to live 71.4 years -- with females (73.8 years) having better prospects than males (69.1 years), according to data published in WHO's annual World Health Statistics report.

Director-general of the UN agency, Margaret Chan, said major strides had been made against ""preventable and treatable diseases"", especially through widened access to antiretroviral therapy for HIV.

The last 15 years have helped reverse the regressions seen through 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic ravaged much of Africa sparking declining health indicators across the continent.

Despite progress in the world's poorer countries, WHO stressed that there remain significant life expectancy gaps between developed and developing nations. ?AFP","['africa', 'aids', 'published', 'world', 'global', 'expectancy', '2000', 'progress', 'health', 'especially', 'life']","Global life expectancy up five years since 2000: WHO Published :Friday, 20 May, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 15GENEVA, May 19 : Global life expectancy increased by five years between 2000 and 2015, the World Health Organization said on Thursday, crediting progress in Africa against HIV, AIDS and malaria.

HIV+ couple thrown out of locality,"KOLKATA: An HIV-positive couple, who had come to terms with their affliction and were preparing for a new life, were assaulted and thrown out their North 24-Parganas locality by relatives and neighbors on Saturday afternoon, reports Times of India.The battered couple went to police, who helped them return to their home.

The battered couple went to police, who helped them return to their home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the taboo that still surrounds the disease. Fortunately, some neighbours have come forward to support them.



The couple has a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them.



The husband, a small-time trader, is 35 years old and his wife 32. She was the first to be detected with HIV during a routine test during her pregnancy in 2006. Her husband was also asked to undergo the test and he, too, tested positive.



After the initial shock, they took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counseling. They decided to keep their condition under the wraps when doctors told them that they could lead a normal life under medication and care.



""The doctor who is treating us advised us of the precautions to take to prevent transmission. We have a daughter who is not infected. We have to take precautions to prevent the disease from spreading to her. The doctor also told us to start saving for antiretroviral therapy,"" the wife told TOI.



A few days ago, her husband's younger brother stumbled upon their secret. He lives in the same house with his wife and two children. As soon as he came to know that his brother and sister-in-law were HIV-positive, he made life miserable for them.



According to the couple, he kept demanding that they leave the house because they were putting him and his family at risk.



""No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,"" she added.



Outnumbered and getting no assistance from locals, the couple and their daughter went to the police and narrated their trauma. Officers immediately sent a team to escort them back to the locality.



""The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband's brother. We have taken down their complaint. We will take strong action against the accused,"" said Barrackpore detective chief C Sudhakar.



When a police contingent accompanied the couple back to their house, the accused were nowhere to be found. After ensuring that the couple was safely in their house, police left a stern message with locals not to bother them in the future. Police are looking for the man's brother and his associates involved in the attack. Sources say he has fled the area with his family.

Rights of women to reproductive health,"In Bangladesh, though many progresses have been achieved regarding women's rights, there are certain areas such as reproductive health where they are being deprived of their rights mainly due to the society's outlook. There are many teenage girls who fell to trouble because of lack of knowledge on reproductive issue.",,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Rights of women to reproductive health Md Sazedul Islam Published :Wednesday, 9 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 25 In Bangladesh, though many progresses have been achieved regarding women's rights, there are certain areas such as reproductive health where they are being deprived of their rights mainly due to the society's outlook. There are many teenage girls who fell to trouble because of lack of knowledge on reproductive issue. If they were aware, they could avoid undesirable situation. But the reality is different, resulting in sufferings for them. The teenage girls cannot share reproductive-related matters with their parents, hence the problem gets complicated. Awareness is very essential for dealing with the situation. According to UNICEF Bangladesh, there are 27.7 million adolescents aged 10-19 years in Bangladesh---13.7 million girls and 14 million boys---making up about one fifth of the total

population.

Most of the adolescents are not aware of sex education; hence they suffer from many diseases such as HIV/AIDS and many other sexual problems. Guardians are not open enough with their children. They never want to talk to their children about sex education because they think that this will decrease their sense of morality. In many situations, adolescents want to know about sex, but they do not get help or information. Proper steps are needed in this regard. These are topics of open discussions with adolescents with sex education being added to school textbooks and guardians' relationships with their children being friendly.

Sex is a biological affair and essential for existence for human being. Sometimes, it may cause many problems and the present world has been facing the problems immensely and HIV/AIDS is one of them. Besides HIV/AIDS, unsafe and unprotected sex cause many other problems such as sexually transmitted diseases or infection.

Ignorance about sexuality, contraception, responsible sex behaviour can expedite teenage pregnancies, abortion and premature death. To solve the problems, human beings need to acquire proper knowledge on safe, healthy and protected sexual behaviour. For this reason sex education for the teenagers or school-going children is very important.

Another issue is hygiene management. Teenage girls and women face severe problem in hygiene management during their menstruation period. Mothers almost never speak to daughters about menstruation, so a girl's first period can be frightening for herself. Menstruation is surrounded by silent, shame and social taboos that are further manifested in social practices. In many cultures restricted mobility, freedom and normal activities and services are in practice. Women and girls in poor families tend not to seek medical help even for serious infections. On top of it, there is reluctance to discuss reproductive health issues. Most Bangladeshi families are too poor to buy sanitary pads and instead, use rags torn from old saris and other cloths. The majority of the girls have no access to clean and safe sanitary products, or to a clean and private space in which she can change menstrual cloths or pads and wash them.

Menstruation is supposed to be invisible and silent, and sometimes, women and girls are supposed to be invisible and silent, too. Many girls and women are subject to restrictions in their daily lives simply because they are menstruating. Besides the health problems due to poor hygiene during menstruation, the lack of facilities and appropriate sanitary products may push menstruating girls temporarily or sometimes permanently out of school, having a negative impact on their right to education.

Cleanliness is not maintained at toilets of many schools. Attendance at school is still a main problem because there is no proper place to change cloths at school. Most of the girls return home during the day if they need to change their cloths, which means they miss at least one hour of school. Parents, social workers and the authorities of the educational institutions should come forward so that the girls get proper atmosphere for hygiene management while staying at educational institutions.

Menstruation health management in Bangladesh is awfully alarming as 80 per cent of girls are accustomed to using old pieces of cloths during menstruation, according to a study published last year. About 40 per cent of girls do not go to school for three days on an average during their menstrual period and they reuse the old pieces of cloth without washing those in hygienic manner or drying those properly, said the report. The report, prepared by assessing the health manners of students, stressed on menstrual health of girls at the national level. The Policy Support Unit of Local Government Division has conducted 'The Baseline Survey on National Hygiene' in association with ICDDR,B.

In some instances, women are forced to observe dietary restrictions. There are still taboos over the issue. It is thought that certain foods should be avoided by the girls and the women during their period. There is widespread belief that menstrual blood is polluted and dangerous and that the menstruating body is weak and shameful, leads to behaviour that exposes women to health risks.

Poor hygiene leads to increased health problems. Poor menstrual hygiene is linked to lower reproductive tract infections, urinary tract infections and others, indicating higher anaemia and infertility, said Dr Nowsheen Sharmin Purabi, a teacher of Gynecology department of Anwer Khan Modern Medical College in the capital.

Education on sexuality, reproductive health and other related issues are needed and this should be included in the textbooks. Our teachers and educational institutions should be prepared to handle the issue, said Dr Purabi, adding that there should be special corner at the hospital for treating the related cases, because it will help the girls maintain privacy and better deal with the situation.

UN backs BD proposal for extension of WTO waiver on pharma patents,Two leading bodies of the United Nations have supported a request made by Bangladesh at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for extending Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) beyond its current deadline of 1 January 2016.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),,2015-05-24 00:00:00,"UN backs BD proposal for extension of WTO waiver on pharma patents Business Correspondent Published : Sunday, 24 May, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 14 Two leading bodies of the United Nations have supported a request made by Bangladesh at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for extending Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) beyond its current deadline of 1 January 2016.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in a joint statement on Thursday said they backed Bangladesh's proposal made at the WTO in February last for extension of TRIPS LDC Waiver. and is now before the

The proposal now being considered by the WTO TRIPS Council sought for an extension of the period under which LDCs are exempt from applying protections for pharmaceutical related patents and clinical data.

""Millions of people rely on access to affordable, assured quality generic medicines,"" the statement quoted UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé as saying,

""WTO Members have before them a critical opportunity to help least-developed countries to reach health and sustainable development goals-failure to support them could put millions of lives at risk,"" he was further quoted in the statement.

The classification of LDCs is contingent on a number of key human development indicators, including levels of poverty, literacy and infant mortality.

Access to adequate healthcare, including affordable medicines, remains a key challenge in most LDCs affecting millions of lives. The flexible intellectual property arrangements currently available to LDCs are a crucial tool for improving health.

""While much progress has been made in scaling up access to HIV treatment, much more will be required in the post-2015 era to achieve the vision of a life of dignity for all, leaving no one behind,"" the statement also quoted UNDP Administrator Helen Clark as telling.

The percentage of people living with HIV who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy has been reduced from 90 per cent in 2006 to 63 per cent in 2013.

LDCs and developing countries have effectively used transition periods to scale up access to treatment for HIV and its co-infections by importing or manufacturing lower-cost generic medicines.

Access to medicines such as sofosbuvir used to treat chronic hepatitis C remains a grave challenge in LDCs because of high prices. Sofosbuvir can cost as much as $ 84 000 for a 12-week course in developed country markets. Lower prices via generic licenses are being offered by the patent-holder in some developing countries, but would still place a considerable burden on health budgets.

A company in Bangladesh, making use of its LDC status, has launched its own version for $900 for the 12-week course. While this price is also out of reach of many patients in LDCs, with the possibility of other manufacturers emerging in LDCs there is potential for greater competition and further price reductions.

There is another transition period in place which UNDP and UNAIDS have previously backed, that exempts LDCs from implementing their WTO intellectual property obligations for all fields of technology but this period expires in 2021.

The proposed transition period on pharmaceutical products, for as long as an LDC remains an LDC, is necessary on top of that general transition period, for the longer-term security it would provide for patients, manufacturers, donors and LDC governments alike.

In accordance with the recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, UNDP and UNAIDS urge all WTO Members to support the LDC request for a transition period on pharmaceutical related patents and clinical data for as long as a country remains an LDC.

They said this at a discussion on ""To Improve Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights for Young Key People"" organized at BRAC Center Inn on Thursday.

The objective of the dissemination seminar was to inform the findings of a three-year project taken up by the Project Management Unit of Link-Up Bangladesh, Marie Stopes Bangladesh and Population Council supported by the Netherlands through International HIV/AIDS Alliance, UK implemented in five countries (Bangladesh, Myanmar, Uganda, Ethiopia and Burundi).

Chief guest at the function Mohammad Wahid Hossain, NDC, Director General, Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP), said, ""To save the young and adolescent groups a massive awareness programme should be launched in the country.""

All the sessions of the seminar were chaired by Dr Fahmida Sultana, (Service) MNCH, DGFP.

Link Up programme was designed to provide information and health services to those most at risk aged between 10 and 24 years.

These vulnerable groups include female sex workers, homosexual men, trans-genders, vulnerable youth (transport workers, fish processing workers), young boys who live in city streets, factory workers (garment workers) and people with HIV.

A total of 240,972 young populations were provided information and sexual and reproductive health services and over 76,000 directly received medical services from Marie Stopes Clinics during the three years project.

The Link Up Programme conducted training for the medical professions to enhance their capacity building and most importantly conduct stigma reduction training to change their attitude.","['seminar', 'basic', 'reproductive', 'programme', 'services', 'told', 'young', 'workers', 'vulnerable', 'bangladesh', 'sexual', 'rights', 'health']","Sexual, reproductive health basic rights of young people, seminar told Staff Correspondent Published :Friday, 29 April, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 32 Speakers at a seminar in the city said young people must be imparted with sexual and reproductive health education for ensuring inclusive development of the younger generation.

But many scientists insist that some problems are not so easily solved. Sooner or later, they argue, the movement that crystalised in the can-do culture of 1980s California will hit the brick wall of the scientifically impossible.

The most recent controversy was in November, when Chinese scientist He Jiankui claimed to have created the world's first genetically edited babies, who he said were HIV-resistant. The backlash from the scientific community led to his work being suspended, as questions were raised not just about the quality of the science, but the ethics of the research.

PARIS, Dec 21: Brain implants, longer lives, genetically modified humans: for the prophets of transhumanism -- the scientifically assisted evolution of humans beyond our current limitations -- it is just a matter of time.But many scientists insist that some problems are not so easily solved. Sooner or later, they argue, the movement that crystalised in the can-do culture of 1980s California will hit the brick wall of the scientifically impossible.The most recent controversy was in November, when Chinese scientist He Jiankui claimed to have created the world's first genetically edited babies, who he said were HIV-resistant. The backlash from the scientific community led to his work being suspended, as questions were raised not just about the quality of the science, but the ethics of the research.Some of today's giants of technology appear to take a similar view.

Deep-rooted homophobia,"Who knew cleaning wipes had so many diverse uses? Removing spilt pasta sauce from dining tabletops; exterminating bacteria in kitchens; wiping away the gay. According to research released last week, straight people show the need to",,2014-06-03 00:00:00,"Deep-rooted homophobia Owen Jones Publish Date : 2014-06-03, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 72 Who knew cleaning wipes had so many diverse uses? Removing spilt pasta sauce from dining tabletops; exterminating bacteria in kitchens; wiping away the gay. According to research released last week, straight people show the need to ""physically cleanse"" at the very thought of contact with gay men. ""Yuck"", was my initial reaction - sadly, a response reciprocated among many of the study's participants - but they do provide a fascinating insight into what makes homophobia tick. Let me explain what the researchers at Goldsmiths University found. In the first study, British students who were asked to imagine borrowing a phone from a gay man came up with significantly more words about cleansing in a word-completion task. In another study, Portuguese students were offered either a yellow pencil or yellow disinfecting wipe after the experiment; those who imagined borrowing a phone from a gay man were more likely to choose the wipe. And, finally, Polish students - again asked to imagine borrowing a phone from a gay man - expressed a preference for cleaning products. Seems pretty definitive: on a subconscious level, gay men are seen as a contaminant, something to be washed away. ""Ugh, I've got gay on me!"", if you will.

As a gay man, maybe I should be hurt, hesitant in future to offer my hand in greeting to another person in case I trigger a subconscious urge to reach for the anti-bacterial gel. But actually the findings intrigued me, because prejudice can only be washed away (if you will) when it is understood. One possible explanation is what you could call an HIV/Aids crisis hangover. HIV was, after all, once the ""gay plague"" (Aids was originally christened Grid - gay related immune deficiency); good old-fashioned homophobia fused with the dread of a frightening illness. From my experience, this isn't a phenomenon exclusive to straight people: some gay men admit that their own chronic fear of HIV is down to an internalised sense of shame. But actually, Agnieszka Golec de Zavala - one of the researchers - tells me this is one of the least interesting explanations.

The most compelling theory is that this impulse to scrub off gayness has everything to do with group identity. Cleansing is about separating: it has ""a very social meaning"" as de Zavala puts it. If you have established a clear division with another group, that they are ""the other"", and you convince yourself that you have nothing in common with them, then any form of interaction becomes contamination. It makes sense: cleansing is often used as a metaphor to separate ourselves from groups we disapprove of. How many of us have joked ""I hope you had a bath afterwards!"" to a friend who has spent time with some perceived undesirables? In its most sinister form, cleansing has underpinned the rhetoric of racist totalitarian regimes: the Nazis were fixated with ""racial purity"" and Mussolini was obsessed with the colour white. ""Ethnic cleansing"" is the perverse euphemism for terrorising other ethnic groups.

This entirely gels with a proper understanding of what homophobia is. Rather than a straightforward dislike or fear of gay people, homophobia is often about ""gender policing"": protecting the boundaries of what it is to be a man. Homophobia is not only directed at gays, after all: straight men suffer it, too. From an early age, those who don't conform to a certain type of masculinity - not being aggressive enough, not speaking about women in sufficiently degrading terms, not being athletic, and so on - risk being labelled a ""poof"". This has everything to do with sexism and misogyny. Both straight men who don't conform to type and gay men are seen as womanly, and being like a woman is considered degrading.

The rather creepy research findings show that the more conservative the man, the stronger the impulse to wash away gay contact. Hardly surprising: more conservative men tend to have a stronger belief in gender difference, in protecting a more unreconstructed masculinity. Gay men are the ultimate menace to this identity, a threat to heterosexual solidarity: the contagion to be washed away.

That's why - without sounding complacent - homophobia is ultimately doomed. Being a man isn't a static concept. Before the 18th century, it was widely believed that men and women were part of the same sex, and that women's vaginas were actually penises tucked inside the body.

The idea of a rigid division between the genders only became dominant in the 19th century: but, with the rise of the women's and LGBT movements, this division has been dramatically eroded. According to the Social Attitudes Survey, in 1987, nearly half of Britons agreed that ""a man's job is to earn money; a woman's job is to look after the home and family""; but that has now toppled to around one in 10.

Young Thais urged to forgo sex,"Valentine's DayBANGKOK, Feb 11 : Bangkok city officials are urging young Thais to forgo sex on Valentine's Day this weekend and visit temples instead, as a far better way to mark the day of love.Thailand has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, public health officials say,",,2015-02-12 00:00:00,"Valentine's Day Young Thais urged to forgo sex Published : Thursday, 12 February, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 22

Valentine's DayBANGKOK, Feb 11 : Bangkok city officials are urging young Thais to forgo sex on Valentine's Day this weekend and visit temples instead, as a far better way to mark the day of love.

Thailand has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, public health officials say, and faces HIV infection rates among its gays comparable to those in Africa's AIDS hotspots.

The Feb. 14 celebrations are a popular Western import in tourist-friendly Thailand, but the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is worried about teenagers making love.

Media surveys have shown teenagers in Thailand pick Valentine's Day as the perfect day to lose their virginity.

""If kids really love each other, it's better for them to go and free birds and fish or go to the temple,"" Pirapong Saicheua, an official of the city authority, told Reuters.

Freeing caged birds is an auspicious Buddhist ritual that believers in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia see as a way of enhancing their merit, or karma.

""Better to put your minds at ease,"" Pirapong added. ""Don't obsess over something inappropriate for your age.""

Predominantly Buddhist Thailand remains mostly conservative despite its reputation as a hotspot for gay bars, nightclubs and massage parlours.

This year, an administration worried over the spike in teenage pregnancies has made available 3.5 million condoms in nearly 80 healthcare centres and city hospitals.

Thailand's health ministry also plans to install condom vending machines in high schools, said Sophon Mekthon, who heads the ministry's disease control department.

Most students welcomed the project, first tested in 2010, but it was opposed by parents who fear the machines could encourage teenagers to have sex.

""Two out of three kids gave positive feedback, but around 90 percent of parents strongly disagreed,"" said Sophon.

Still, young people in Bangkok say there is little chance of moral guardians persuading them to rein in sexual activity.

""I think sex can't be prohibited,"" said Khemaphat Santong, a 21-year-old student at the city's Chulalongkorn University.

C-section delivery increasing alarmingly,,,None,"C-section delivery increasing alarmingly



According to the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), 15 pregnant women per day and 5,200 women per year die due to this caesarean delivery.



According to Rajshahi District Civil Surgeon-2017 information, caesarean service has been provided to 4,910 mothers through different NGOs, private clinics and hospitals in different upazilas of Rajshahi.



Of them, 13 newborns and 6 mothers died. On the other hand, there were 6,251normal deliveries, but no mother died.



Around 80 percent of caesarean sections happen at private hospitals and clinics. For a caesarean delivery, they charge up to 15 thousand to 50 thousand taka. Because of this, doctors advise for Caesarian section in most cases.



Initial study of Maternal Mortality and Health Care Survey (BMMS) in Bangladesh found that 196 mothers died in the C-section cases. At present, this Caesarean delivery has become a cause of deep concern in the country.



Women with caesarean surgeries experience excessive bleeding, more pain, and children born after 39 weeks may have respiratory problems. Also, if the mother wants to take another child then different complications arise and it can be risky.

Preserved Child Health, Nutrition and HIV / AIDS Wing Director Dr. Ishtiaq Mannan said, most Caesarean delivery is unnecessary in Bangladesh. However, it is a serious problem in the village level. Because there may not be all the doctors experienced. It can be more risky if it does operation.



According to experts, it was used in the country as a strategy to reduce the birth rate. Caesarean is risky than normal delivery and later many problems arise. C-section surgery is relatively painful. But private hospitals see the section as commercial for the sake of higher profits. The hospital also lacks quality control and lack of ethics.

Caesarean is delivery of baby through mother's womb surgery. Around 6 inches below the mother's stomach was cut and the child was taken from there. After that, the stove was cut off from the carpet area. This is an emergency process.



Meanwhile, patients and their relatives have to be under pressure by doctors about delivery of C-section. In most cases, mothers are admitted to hospital in the last stages. Due to this, instead of normal delivery for reducing the risk of mother and child, doctors opted for C-section. But if anyone contacts with specialist doctors from the beginning of his pregnancy then it is possible to avoid risk of 60 to 70 percent.



According to the Family Planning Department, there is a trained manpower problem. Staff need minimum 1 year training for normal delivery. Currently the training has been done for 6 months. But there is a lack of trained staff across the country.

Experts for comprehensive sex education for adolescents,,,None,"Speakers on Sunday said comprehensive sex education is very important for adolescents to deal with difficulties they face in life.

It can be likened to a mixed bag of satisfaction and disappointment, in terms of progress made in meeting the MDGs. These goals were adopted in September 2000 by the world leaders at the United Nations headquarters. The MDGs range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education, all by the target year of 2015.

A review of the progress made in reaching the MDGs during the penultimate year of the deadline set by the UN is a must-do job. The UN itself has published a progress report that also speaks of mixed results. The poor developing countries would generally be successful in meeting some of the targets by the timeframe. But it would take some more time for them to reach a few important goals such as reducing the child and maternal mortality rates and boosting the number of children attending primary education. However, the UN in its report published in July last claimed that the MDGs had made 'profound' difference to people's lives in the poor developing regions of the world.

Bangladesh, according to the government report, has also made some laudable progress in achieving a good number of MDGs including those of poverty reduction and child and maternal mortality rate. But it is unlikely to reach some of the other key targets within the UN-set deadline. Employment generation, gender equality, improvement of the nutritional status of the population and forest coverage are among the areas where progress has been rather unsatisfactory.

The MDGs set eight goals under which there are 21 targets and 60 indicators with targets to measure the progress. According to the report, Bangladesh is, in general, on track in achieving partial success in areas like eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equity and empowering women, reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. The country, however, lagged behind in achieving three goals - combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development - which needed more attention. The current employment rate for the country's population aged 15+ is 59.3 per cent. The country will not be able to achieve the target of ensuring employment for all by 2015, and the percentage of women in wage employment needs to be raised to 50 per cent by 2015 which is now only 19 per cent.

Notwithstanding the fact that Bangladesh is being frequently cited as a role model in MDG achievement globally, its failure to make a satisfactory level of progress in meeting the targets concerning employment, primary education, adult literacy, women empowerment, nutritional and forest coverage will continue to hurt most the impoverished section of its population.

There is no denying that the developed economies, particularly the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) countries have failed to keep their promises on making available at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) to the developing and least developed countries, including Bangladesh, as official development assistance (ODA) to help the latter achieve MDGs. The development assistance that Bangladesh has been receiving since the launching of the MDGs is not enough for achieving the targets. However, the failure to keep commitments on the part of the rich and developed countries on resource transfer is nothing new. It has happened time and again.

But what remains more important is the prudent use of domestic as well as foreign funds through the right kind of projects and programmes that would directly or indirectly help achieve the MDGs. Wastage and misallocation of scarce resources in public sector programmes are quite common features in Bangladesh. Thus, there is an urgent need to make improvements in the utilization of public resources. More importantly, the government should ensure greater involvement of the private sector to supplement, not to supplant, its own initiatives that are purported to meeting MDGs and also other national development goals.

According to the seventh MDG Bangladesh Progress Report, as quoted in the press, the country made progress in achieving some indicators of millennium development goals. The said report also mentioned that in other important targets including ensuring employment for all, increasing share of women in wage employment, adult literacy and completion of primary schooling, Bangladesh lagged behind. However, in the assessment of the Planning Ministry, it emerged that Bangladesh, still considered as a Least Developed Nation, has met some other Millennium Development Goals. What has most economists stumped is that Bangladesh will certainly not attain the targets by 2015 and there has been lack of promised international support for achieving such.

Under these circumstances, developed nations must come forward with more private investment in Bangladesh, which would prove more effective in helping Bangladesh to achieve the goals. Seemingly, Bangladesh is on the right track in achieving the goals set, but lack of adequate infrastructure and assistance from developed countries poses a big hindrance to bridge the gap of unmet goals. It is high time the government, experts and industry insiders came together to ensure a better standing of Bangladesh in the global context by helping to lead the country in the right and effective direction. Ultimately such goals must be achieved by our own efforts.

At the top of it, to attain a sustainable development level, there must be strong and honest political leadership with the will to deliver good governance free from corruption and vices of over-politicisation of the affairs of the state down to the ground level.r

How to ensure every development dollar counts,,,None,"In 2017, $146 billion was spent on aid and development. Even this large sum remains a fraction of what would be needed to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, despite the scarce resources, there is surprisingly little discussion about setting priorities in development spending.

In international polls and on the world stage, developing countries are very clear about their priorities: Improved health care and education, more and better jobs, less corruption, and solutions to nutritional challenges. Unfortunately, these areas are not necessarily where rich countries direct funds.

In fact, if current trends hold, the world will fail to achieve the SDGs' targets for 2030 in a host of areas: Maternal mortality, tuberculosis, family planning access, HIV, non-communicable disease mortality, pre-primary and primary school access, stunting, wasting, undernourishment, violence against women, birth registration, water access, gender equality in public leadership, sanitation access, and air pollution.

But, instead of allocating development funding to try to speed up progress in these areas, much of it is being directed elsewhere. To take the most glaring example: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that more than 20 percent of development aid is being spent on climate change-related projects and activities.

Clearly, more could be achieved in health, education, and other areas if one-fifth of development spending did not go toward projects like rolling out inefficient solar ""microgrids,"" which tick a ""climate"" box for donors but do little to transform lives. Climate concerns rank last or near last among policy issues in global polls of developing countries.

How could development funds be better used? Cost-benefit analysis can play a vital role in shining a light on interventions and investments that achieve the most for every dollar spent.

The Copenhagen Consensus Center, the think tank that I lead, undertook a comprehensive study of the 169 SDG targets. It examined the entire menu of development options and added prices and detailed information about what each could achieve. This analysis revealed that, of the 169 targets, 19 represent the best value for money.

Consider the often overlooked - and politically frowned-upon - development target of universal access to family planning, which the analysis showed would cost $3.6 billion annually. Ensuring that women have control over pregnancy would mean 150,000 fewer maternal deaths and 600,000 fewer orphaned children per year. It would also lead to a demographic dividend, boosting economic growth. The total benefits to society from every dollar spent would reach some $120.

Similarly, investment in child nutrition pays lifelong dividends because a healthy diet enables better brain and muscle development. Well-nourished children stay in school longer, learn more and end up being much more productive members of society. The evidence suggests that providing better nutrition for 68 million children each year would produce more than $40 in long-term social benefits for every dollar spent.

Or consider tuberculosis, the planet's most deadly (and most overlooked) infectious disease. Tuberculosis hits the world's poorest people and mostly affects young adults at an age when they have just become parents and economically active. Families lose incomes and children lose parents. Our analysis shows that investment in expanding tuberculosis testing and treatment delivers $43 of social benefits for each dollar spent.

An expert panel of economists, including two Nobel laureates, found that every dollar spent on these and the rest of the 19 most effective global development targets would return $20-$40 in long-term social benefits. In contrast, allocating funds evenly across all 169 targets would yield benefits worth less than $10 per dollar spent. In other words, focusing first on taking the most effective actions would be the same as doubling or even quadrupling the aid budget.

Cost-benefit analysis by the Copenhagen Consensus Center is now helping set national priorities in Bangladesh and Haiti, and at the state level in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh in India. In Bangladesh, the findings have supported the government's roll-out of more efficient and transparent e-procurement policies and more focused nutrition initiatives; in Haiti, they are underpinning the decision by the government and donors to fortify local flour with vital micronutrients to save young lives.

The challenge is to expand this approach further. Cost-benefit analysis should not dictate how every aid and development dollar is spent. But the clock continues to tick toward 2030, and the world is behind schedule on many of its development targets. If we ignore economic efficiency, we risk failing to make the needed progress against humanity's greatest challenges.

Bjorn Lomborg, a visiting professor at the Copenhagen Business School, is Director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center. His books include ""The Skeptical Environmentalist,"" ""Cool It,"" ""How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place,"" ""The Nobel Laureates' Guide to the Smartest Targets for the World,"" and, most recently, ""Prioritizing Development.""

Sexual violence: A serious public health problem,,,None,"Sexual violence: A serious public health problem



â€œThere are varieties of reasons why male rape is under-reported, including shame, guilt and fear of not being believed or of being denounced for what has occurred. Myths and strong prejudices surrounding male sexuality also prevent men from coming forward.â€



Apart from physical force, it may involve psychological intimidation, blackmail or other threats -- for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person aggressed is unable to give consent -- for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding the situation.

Sexual violence includes rape, defined as physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration -- even if slight -- of the vulva or anus, using a penis, other body parts or an object. The attempt to do so is known as attempted rape. Rape of a person by two or more perpetrators is known as gang rape. Sexual violence can include other forms of assault involving a sexual organ, including coerced contact between the mouth and penis, vulva or anus.

A wide range of sexually violent acts can take place in different circumstances and settings. These include, for example: rape within marriage or dating relationships; rape by strangers; systematic rape during armed conflict; unwanted sexual advances or sexual harassment, including demanding sex in return for favours; sexual abuse of mentally or physically disabled people; sexual abuse of children; forced marriage or cohabitation, including the marriage of children; denial of the right to use contraception or to adopt other measures to protect against sexually transmitted diseases; forced abortion; violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including female genital mutilation and obligatory inspections for virginity; forced prostitution and trafficking of people for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

There is no universally accepted definition of trafficking for sexual exploitation. The term encompasses the organized movement of people, usually women, between countries and within countries for sex work.

Such trafficking also includes coercing a migrant into a sexual act as a condition of allowing or arranging the migration. Sexual trafficking uses physical coercion, deception and bondage incurred through forced debt. Trafficked women and children, for instance, are often promised work in the domestic or service industry, but instead are usually taken to brothels where their passports and other identification papers are confiscated. They may be beaten or locked up and promised their freedom only after earning -- through prostitution -- their purchase price, as well as their travel and visa costs.

Studies from both industrialized and developing countries reveal that forced first intercourse is not rare. Unfortunately, there are few reliable statistics on the number of boys and men raped in settings such as schools, prisons and refugee camps.

Most experts believe that official statistics vastly under-represent the number of male rape victims. The evidence available suggests that males may be even less likely than female victims to report an assault to the authorities.

There are varieties of reasons why male rape is under-reported, including shame, guilt and fear of not being believed or of being denounced for what has occurred. Myths and strong prejudices surrounding male sexuality also prevent men from coming forward.

As is the case with female victims of sexual assault, research suggests that male victims are likely to suffer from a range of psychological consequences, both in the immediate period after the assault and over the longer term.

These include guilt, anger, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction, somatic complaints, sleep disturbances, withdrawal from relationships and attempted suicide. In addition to these reactions, studies of adolescent males have also found an association between suffering rape and substance abuse, violent behaviour, stealing and absenteeism from school.

Among the various ways of reducing the incidence of both sexual violence and HIV infection, education is perhaps the foremost. For young people, above all, there must be comprehensive interventions in schools and other educational institutes, youth groups and workplaces.

School curricula should cover relevant aspects of sexual and reproductive health, relationships and violence. They should also teach life skills, including how to avoid risky or threatening situations -- related to such things as violence, sex or drugs -- and how to negotiate safe sexual behaviour.

For the adult population in general there should be full and accessible information on sexual health and the consequences of specific sexual practices, as well as interventions to change harmful patterns of behaviour and social norms that hinder communication on sexual matters.

It is important that health care workers and other service providers receive integrated training on gender and reproductive health, including gender-based violence and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV infection. For rape victims, there should be screening and referral for HIV infection.

Also, the use of post exposure prophylaxis for HIV --- given soon after the assault, together with counselling --- may be considered. Similarly, women with HIV should be screened for a possible history of sexual violence. Voluntary counselling programmes for HIV should consider incorporating violence prevention strategies.

Sexual violence is a common and serious public health problem affecting millions of people each year throughout the world. It is driven by many factors operating in a range of social, cultural and economic contexts. At the heart of sexual violence directed against women is gender inequality.

In many countries, data on most aspects of sexual violence are lacking, and there is a great need everywhere for research on all aspects of sexual violence. Of equal importance are interventions. These are of various types, but the essential ones concern the primary prevention of sexual violence, targeting both women and men, interventions supporting the victims of sexual assault, measures to make it more likely that perpetrators of rape will be caught and punished, and strategies for changing social norms and raising the status of women.

It is vital to develop interventions for resource-poor settings and rigorously to evaluate programmes in both industrialized and developing countries. Health professionals have a large role to play in supporting the victims of sexual assault -- medically and psychologically -- and collecting evidence to assist prosecutions.

The health sector is considerably more effective in countries where there are protocols and guidelines for managing cases and collecting evidence, where staffs are well-trained and where there is good collaboration with the judicial system.

Ultimately, the strong commitment and involvement of governments and civil society, along with a coordinated response across a range of sectors, are required to end sexual violence.

Sexual violence is defined as: any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work. Coercion can cover a whole spectrum of degrees of force.Apart from physical force, it may involve psychological intimidation, blackmail or other threats -- for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought.

He had told a human genome forum in Hong Kong that there had been ""another potential pregnancy"" involving a second couple.

A provincial government investigation has since confirmed the existence of the second mother and that the woman was still pregnant, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The expectant mother and the twin girls from the first pregnancy will be put under medical observation, an investigator told Xinhua.

Blood safety

We must make sure it is safe for people to give blood and for patients to receive donated blood. Blood safety information is provided below:

Screening

Donors are examined for signs and symptoms of diseases that can be transmitted in a blood transfusion, such as HIV, malaria, syphilis, and viral hepatitis. Screening may include questions about risk factors for various diseases.

Donor preparation

The donor is also examined and asked specific questions about their medical history to make sure that donating blood is not hazardous to their health. The donor's haemoglobin level is tested to make sure that the loss of blood will not make them anaemic. Pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature are also evaluated. The safety of donating blood during pregnancy has not been studied thoroughly, and pregnant women are usually deferred until six weeks after the pregnancy.

Advantages of blood donation

Generally, a human being has at least 5-6 litres of blood. During blood donation, we donate 250 -400 ml of blood which is only 10 per cent of total blood. Moreover, blood consists of water, which is replaceable within 24 hours.

Blood donation allows bone marrows to produce new blood in body.

RBC has a life span of 120 days. So, within 3 months RBC of blood break down and stimulates growth of new blood RBC. Blood donation is really a healthy process.

Blood donation keeps your heart and liver healthy and prevents cardiac and hepatic diseases.

During blood donation screening procedure is done which identifies whether a person has any of these diseases: Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malaria, syphilis, HIV (AIDS).

Blood donation helps to keep our cholesterol under control.

Excessive amount of iron is called heamochromatosis. So, regular blood donation helps to prevent this.

It also helps to keep your weight in control.

Grave dilemma: South African cities short of cemetery space,,,None,"Grave dilemma: South African cities short of cemetery space

They were preparing the grave to be reused as towns across South Africa are fast running out of space to bury the dead.

Population growth, migration to urban areas and an influx of foreigners has put huge pressure on land in urban areas. Adding to the problem is a cultural resistance to the practice of cremation.

Between 45 and 60 graves are re-opened each week on average to allow for second burials in Johannesburg, the country's largest city and economic hub.

Authorities warn that if no action is taken to change how the dead are laid to rest, urban areas will run out of room in as little as 50 years.

""Burial space is fast diminishing. This is caused by the fact that Joburg is currently experiencing high migration,"" said Reggie Moloi, the city's cemeteries and crematoria manager.

Johannesburg is not the only city in South Africa battling the shortage.

The southeastern coastal city of Durban raised the alarm more than a decade ago.

The city had an unusually high death rate in the 1980s, having been particularly hard hit by political violence and HIV/AIDS, say officials.

- 'Run out of burial space' -

""We noticed that cemeteries then filled up in a shortest period of time and that quite soon ... (we were) going to run out of burial space,"" Thembinkosi Ngcobo, the head of parks in eThekwini, which includes Durban, told AFP.

People seeking burial space could soon be turned away, he warned. ""We are facing a very serious problem.""

""The situation is dire and not readily understood... because to the eye it seems there is sufficient (space),"" said Denis Ing, deputy chairman of the South African Cemeteries Association.

The public did not grasp the scale of the problem, he said.

The crisis has pushed officials to think creatively about how best to dispose of the dead.

While recycling graves has helped ease the situation, cremation still faces significant resistance from African communities, which see it as unnatural and against tradition.

At Roodepoort near Soweto, the Sipamla family buried 87-year-old mother and grandmother Caroline Sipamla in the same grave as her son.

Crackdown on sex trade in China’s Dongguan,"HONG KONG, Feb 10 : Chinese authorities have carried out a rare crackdown on the sex trade in the",,2014-02-11 00:00:00,"Crackdown on sex trade in China’s Dongguan Publish Date : 2014-02-11, Publish Time : 21:08, View Count : 1 HONG KONG, Feb 10 : Chinese authorities have carried out a rare crackdown on the sex trade in the ""sin city"" of Dongguan following a candid report by the state broadcaster on the underground industry, reports Reuters.

China outlawed prostitution after the Communist revolution in 1949, but it returned with a vengeance following landmark economic reforms three decades ago, and has helped fuel a rise in HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases.

While the government carries out periodic crackdowns, it is unusual for state media to cover them in such a high-profile way or for top officials to comment on the problem, underscoring worry about the explosion of the sex trade.

Media said 67 people were arrested and 12 venues were shut down in a sting operation involving thousands of police in the Dongguan region at the heart of China's Pearl River Delta industrial hub in the southern province of Guangdong.

Provincial Communist party boss Hu Chunhua, stressed the need ""to conduct an extensive trawling-style crackdown on the entire city"", according to a report in the Nanfang Daily.

Two city police chiefs had been suspended, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported.

China's main state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), aired a half-hour report on Sunday chronicling what appeared to be extensive and open prostitution in five towns across Dongguan.

Secretly shot footage showed scantily clad women parading on a stage and managers of venues speaking openly about prostitution services.

The CCTV report was widely watched across China and followed with interest and widely commented on social media.

While periodic sweeps against vice have been carried out, including during sensitive periods such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, the industry has thrived. Law enforcement often appears to be lax.

The Dongguan region has long been known as a hub for the sex industry.

Authorities there said last month the city had seen a high incidence of HIV/AIDS amid rumors that more than 2,700 sex workers had been infected, according to the Global Times, a Chinese tabloid owned by the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily.

Ending violence against women,,,None,"Ending violence against women

It is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives. However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime.



Women who have experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence report higher rates of depression, having an abortion and acquiring HIV, compared to women who have not.

Similar to data from other regions, in all four countries of a multi-country study from the Middle East and North Africa, men who witnessed their fathers using violence against their mothers, and men who experienced some form of violence at home as children, were significantly more likely to report perpetrating intimate partner violence in their adult relationships. For example, in Lebanon the likelihood of perpetrating physical violence was more than three times higher among men who had witnessed their fathers beating their mothers during childhood than those who did not .



It is estimated that of all women who were the victims of homicide globally in 2012, almost half were killed by intimate partners or family members, compared to less than six per cent of men killed in the same year. In Latin America and the Caribbean according to official data from 16 countries, a total of 2, 554 women were victims of femicide in 2017.



Adult women account for 51 per cent of all human trafficking victims detected globally. Women and girls together account for 71 per cent, with girls representing nearly three out of every four child trafficking victims. Nearly three out of every four trafficked women and girls are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation [4].



It is estimated that there are 650 million women and girls in the world today who were married before age 18. During the past decade, the global rate of child marriage has declined-from one in four young women (aged 20-24) being married as children, to almost one in five. Still, in West and Central Africa-where this harmful practice is most common-over four out of 10 young women were married before their 18th Child marriage often results in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupts schooling, limits the girl's opportunities and increases her risk of experiencing domestic violence.



At least 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone female genital mutilation in the 30 countries with representative data on prevalence. In most of these countries, the majority of girls were cut before age five. With population movement, female genital mutilation is becoming a practice with global dimensions, in particular among migrant and refugee women and girls.



Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Out of these, 9 million adolescent girls were victimized within the past year. In the vast majority of countries, adolescent girls are most at risk of forced sex by a current/former husband, partner or boyfriend. Based on data from 30 countries, only one per cent ever sought professional help.



Globally, one out of three students (aged 11 and 13 to 15 years) have been bullied by their peers at school at least on one day in the past month, with girls and boys equally likely to experience bullying. However, boys are more likely to experience physical bullying than girls, and girls are more likely to experience psychological bullying, particularly being ignored or left out or subject to nasty rumours. Girls also report being made fun of because of how their face or body looks more frequently than boys. School-related gender-based violence is a major obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls.



Twenty-three per cent of female undergraduate university students reported having experienced sexual assault or sexual misconduct in a survey across 27 universities in the United States in 2015. Rates of reporting to campus officials, law enforcement or others ranged from five to 28 per cent, depending on the specific type of behavior.

One in 10 women in the European Union report having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15 (including having received unwanted, offensive sexually explicit emails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on social networking sites). The risk is highest among young women between 18 and 29 years of age.



In a multi-country study from the Middle East and North Africa, between 40 and 60 per cent of women said they had ever experienced street-based sexual harassment (mainly sexual comments, stalking/following, or staring/ogling), and 31 per cent to 64 per cent of men said they had ever carried out such acts. Younger men, men with more education, and men who experienced violence as children were more likely to engage in street sexual harassment.



Results from a national Australian survey show that almost two out of five women (39 per cent) aged 15 and older who have been in the workforce in the last five years have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace during that period, compared to one out of four (26 per cent) of their male counterparts. Regarding most common perpetrators, in almost 4 out of 5 cases (79 per cent) one or more of the perpetrators were male.



Eighty-two per cent of women parliamentarians who participated in a study conducted by the Inter-parliamentary Union in 39 countries across 5 regions reported having experienced some form of psychological violence (remarks, gestures and images of a sexist or humiliating sexual nature made against them or threats and/or mobbing) while serving their terms. They cited social media as the main channel through which such psychological violence is perpetrated; nearly half of those surveyed (44 per cent) reported having received death, rape, assault or abduction threats towards them or their families. Sixty-five per cent had been subjected to sexist remarks, primarily by male colleagues in parliament and from opposing parties as well as their own.



Measures to address violence

In the majority of countries with available data, less than 40 per cent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort. Among women who do, most look to family and friends and very few look to formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than 10 per cent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police.

At least 144 countries have passed laws on domestic violence, and 154 have laws on sexual harassment. However, even when laws exist, this does not mean they are always compliant with international standards and recommendations or implemented .



Availability of data on violence against women has increased significantly in recent years. Since 1995, more than 100 countries have conducted at least one survey addressing the issue. More than 40 countries conducted at least two surveys in the period between 1995 and 2014, which means that, depending on the comparability of the surveys, changes over time could be analysed.



Leaving no one behind

Evidence suggests that certain characteristics of women, such as sexual orientation, disability status or ethnicity, and some contextual factors, such as humanitarian crises, including conflict and post-conflict situations, may increase women's vulnerability to violence. In 2014, 23 per cent of non-heterosexual women (those who identified their sexual orientation as lesbian, bisexual or other) interviewed in the European Union indicated having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by both male and female non-partner perpetrators, compared with five per cent of heterosexual women .



Data from female participants of prevention interventions in six low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa show that women with disabilities are two to four times more likely to experience partner violence than those without disabilities. Furthermore, the risk of experiencing all forms of partner violence and non-partner sexual violence increases with the severity of impairment. Qualitative data shows that disability-related stigma and discrimination, compounds women's vulnerability to violence and hinders their ability to seek help.

Besides, the country has made significant progress in several indicators such as poverty reduction, children enrolment in primary education, weight deficiency of children, death rate of mothers, expansion of child vaccination and reduction of contagious disease.

The achievement of the country has been reflected in a progress report, prepared by the General Economic Division (GED) of Planning Commission, which would be published tomorrow.

Talking to BSS, Prof. Shamsul Alam, GED Member, said Bangladesh is the most advanced country in achieving MDGs and its achievement is more compared to any other countries. ""No country will attain all the goals before Bangladesh.""

The report said Bangladesh needs US$ 78.2 billion to achieve all the indicators of MDGs (2011-15). The country requires US$ 5 billion and US$ 3 billion foreign assistances to attain general growth and higher growth annually.

Analyzing the ""MDGs: Bangladesh Progress Report- 2013"" found that the country has received US$ 1.68 billion Official Development Assistance (ODA), which was very nominal against the required US$ 3 billion assistance annually for attaining the higher growth.

In fiscal 2012-13, Bangladesh has been given a total of 48.24 per cent ODA, which proved that internal resources of the country have driven the achievement of MDGs.

Apart from the significant achievements, some desired goals are not possible to attain by 2015. Not only Bangladesh, also all the countries would fail to achieve the indicators and those are:

Providing employment to all eligible workforce, ensuring zero per cent drop out before completing class five, cent percent literacy rate between 15-24 age, improve the literacy rate to cent per cent of age 15 and above, women participation rate to 50 per cent in non- agriculture sector and increase forest area to 20 per cent with 70 per cent tree density.

Bangladesh will advocate including those goals in the Post MDGs agenda.

On the other hand, the report said the country should put more concentration to few sectors. They are: reduction of huger related poverty and increase employment, increase of the rate of conclusion of primary education and adult literacy, creation of more qualified employment opportunities for women, attendance of educated health worker during childbirth, awareness and available information about HIV/AIDS. ?BSS","['oda', 'achieves', 'rate', 'required', 'country', 'goals', 'indicators', 'billion', 'report', 'cent', 'bangladesh', 'bd', 'mdgs', 'reduction']","Talking to BSS, Prof. Shamsul Alam, GED Member, said Bangladesh is the most advanced country in achieving MDGs and its achievement is more compared to any other countries.

Exclusitve Interview: UN consultant suggests harder efforts for tobacco control,"Dr Mira Aghi, a UN consultant who has worked on different issues relating to development, recently came to Bangladesh.

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Observer, she talked about the status of Tobacco Control efforts in Bangladesh as well as the impact of Meena Cartoon on the development of girl child.

Recipient of several Indian and international awards, Mira Aghi has Ph.D degree on Psychology from the Loyola University of Chicago, USA. Apart from that she received training on developing television programmes for children and had attended 'Communication Research and Production' conducted by Dr AD Palmer in New York.

Moreover, she worked with UNESCO, HIV/AIDS, Drug Abuse and Youth Development as consultant for a long time. She also served as consultant to UNDP, UN Women, Unicef, UNFPA, and WHO.

In an exclusive interview with The Daily Observer she said Bangladesh government has achieved tremendous success in the area of Tobacco Control, but still some loopholes in the law need to be plugged for proper implementation of the Tobacco Control Act. She said to make the law effective the most important tools will be graphic health warnings on all tobacco packets.

Mira Aghi said the tobacco companies are mainly responsible for slow implementation of the law. She suggested that for the implementation of the existing laws all provisions should be put to work together.

A large number of people are involved in cultivation of tobacco. The tobacco companies say if this business is stopped then they will become jobless. This she felt was a lame excuse.

The excerpts of the interview are as follows:

Daily Observer: You have worked as the director of creative research, on the Meena Communications which aimed at changing the behaviour and attitudes of the people in South Asian countries towards the girl child. Do you think this project has brought about any change in the mindset of people in South Asia?

Mira Aghi: Of course, it brought a great change. In Bangladesh, when I talked to a group of mothers about equal treatment of their kids, they started talking to me about the Meena episode ""Dividing the mango"" equally between Meena and her brother. In South Asia, there is a tradition of giving more care and love to sons more than the daughters. To break this tradition the Meena cartoon put emphasis on equal treatment of both boys and girls to give the message that girls and boys all are equal and they should be treated equally in every regard.

This group of mothers shared their feelings with me, that after watching this episode they were determined they would give equal treatment to their boys and girls.

Daily Observer: Why do we not see any other animation initiative like the Meena Communications?

Mira Aghi: Well, we have different plans and projects, we will introduce other animations like Meena Communications in future as a tool to make people aware of and conscious about many things including health, dowry and others.

Daily Observer: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina very recently for the first time attended a girl summit in London, where she mentioned the issue of early marriage as a big problem in South Asia. Do you think Meena can be used as means to prevent it?

Mira Aghi: Definitely. Let me tell you that one of the episodes of Meena Cartoon was focused on early marriage. And it talked about how it was very difficult for the parents to defer early marriage of their daughters, but through the Meena a message was given that a daughter should not be married off until she is 18. And it also gave other pieces of information, such as if a girl is married in her early age, she is thrown into lots of problems including the danger that she can die during the time of childbirth. Through the Meena, we also addressed the problem of dowry. The great effect of the film was the boys started thinking that they would not take dowry from the girl's family and they realized that taking dowry was not a good practice and both the families came to an agreement that no dowry would be given or taken.

The ancient 'Silk Road' has been revived by Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation (BCIM), a sub-regional organisation of Asian nations aimed at greater integration of trade and investment between the four countries. The BCIM corridor is an ambitious undertaking that hopes to connect Kunming with Kolkata.

Leading Chinese scholars cautioned that ethnic insurgencies, terrorism, drug trafficking and the accompanying spread of HIV infections, antiques smuggling, as well as cross-border human trafficking, are may derail the mega plan. The 'Silk Road' envisages formation of a thriving economic belt, focusing on cross-border transport, energy and telecommunication networks.

An ancient trade route, 'Silk Road' was formally established during the Han Dynasty of China, which linked the regions of the ancient world in commerce.

A Chinese think-tank have proposed setting up a security mechanism and accelerating a legal dialogue among Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar, in order to turn the proposed BCIM corridor into an economic reality.

Dr Ren Jia, President of the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, told prestigious The Hindu newspaper that a four-country institutional tie-up to address the non-traditional security threats to the BCIM project.

Emphasising the non-traditional threats to security, Dr. Ren pointed out that the crucial issue needs to be addressed, otherwise the establishment of the corridor would be endangered.

Fighting between Myanmar Army and ethnic Kokang rebels, known as the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, based near the Chinese border, pose a threat to the network.

The United Wa State Army, notorious for narcotics trafficking, has virtually a free reign in north-eastern Myanmar, poses a big security problem to the BCIM corridor. Communal violence involving Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims has also flared in Rakhine State.

Institutionalising a four-nation security partnership should become part of the recommendation of the Joint Study Group (JSG), which is expected to meet later this year in India.

Focusing ""on strengthening connectivity in the BCIM region,"" the JSG was formed two years ago following a Sino-Indian initiative during the meeting between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2013. The concept developed in the 1990s came to be known as the 'Kunming Initiative', an economic cooperation within the BCIM region was the brainchild of Bangladeshi economist Professor Rehman Sobhan.","['vital', 'corridor', 'myanmar', 'security', 'threat', 'trafficking', 'economic', 'silk', 'seen', 'bcim', 'chinese', 'addressing', 'road']","Addressing security threat to 'Silk Road' seen vital Saleem Samad Published : Tuesday, 30 June, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 153 Security threat to the much hyped Kunming to Kolkata 'Silk Road' needs to be addressed to achieve an economic reality of the mega plan.

The MDGs were established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000 to achieve eight goals by 2015.

While setting the MDGs, global problems prevailing at that time were considered and eight goals such as eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development were taken up.

The experts here now feel some key challenges were not reflected in the MDGs such as ensuring inclusive growth and employment creation, tackling climate change and achieving sustainable development.

Meanwhile, as part of contributions to the global dialogue on the post -2015 agenda, based on Bangladesh's experience, a total of 13 goals have been formulated, with suggested targets and indicators.

Among those, Goal no 1 suggests securing economic growth that is inclusive, reducing poverty and inequality, and creating sufficient numbers of decent jobs.

Goal 2 speaks of ensuring sustainable food security and good nutrition, goal 3 includes reducing social inequality, particularly among marginalized groups and improving living condition, goal no 4 suggests achieving equality between women and men.

The Chairman of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSP), Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, said, ""The developed countries since 2010-2012 are talking about compensation for climate change, amounting to $ 30 million but they have not paid it yet.""

He also noted that to reach the MDGs people belonging to disadvantaged communities such as dalit, tea garden and Haor workers and marginal farmers should be integrated with the mainstream development.

Referring to the present allocation in the budget, he said that only an amount of TK.14 crore has been allocated for about 65 lakh dalit people across the country.

Emphasizing structural causes that create poverty and inequality, Dr. Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir, Associate Professor of Economics, Department of Development Studies, University of Dhaka, emphasized creation of employment and ensuring justice for all in the post- 2015 development framework. Ahmed Swapan Mahmud, Executive Director of the Voice, a rights based organization, said remarkable progress has been made in some of the MDGs, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction, gender parity in education, maternal mortality, child mortality and combating HIV/AIDS and other major diseases.

""However, much remains to be addressed in the areas of nutrition, maternal health, environmental sustainability and growing inequalities based on geography, groups, particularly gender,"" he added.

A.S.M Badrul Alam, President of Bangladsh Krishak Federation, laid stress on small scale and agro- ecological farming.

Water? Shelter? What about Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH)? Do we give it enough thought?if not, then it is high time we did! Women, young girls and boys are left homeless and are the most vulnerable during such situations.

More than a third of maternal deaths worldwide occur in crisis settings. In crisis situations, there is a lack of access to basic emergency-obstetric services and only a small proportion of deliveries are attended by skilled service providers, leading to preventable maternal and newborn morbidity. Young girls and boys are also at the danger of STIs, HIV and human trafficking. It is but, a grim reality that the risk of sexual assault, coercion and exploitation increases whenever social order breaks down and people are displaced.

Temporary camps too can pose a great risk for women and girls who venture out alone to finish the daily chores. Crowding and lack of privacy can lead to gender-based violence. Accessing ante-natal and post-natal care too becomes a challenge.

With health facilities in a dire situation and buildings inundated, pregnant women and new mothers find it extremely difficult to access quality healthcare.

This is where International Planned Parenthood Federation's (IPPF's) SPRINT initiative (Sexual and Reproductive Health Programme in Crisis and Post-Crisis Situations) comes into action. IPPF through the SPRINT Initiative works on providing key medical and SRH services to the affected population.

According to government data, slow moving monsoon depression had caused lethal amounts of rain in Bangladesh on July 29, apart from forming cyclone storm Komen, which drenched the already submerged districts of the country. The heavy floods were followed by mudslides.

As per reports, more than 200,000 people have been affected, out of which an estimated 25 per cent are women of reproductive age, 20 per cent men are sexually active, and we are reaching out to these people with key SRH services.

IPPF-SPRINT along with its Member Association-Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB) is working closely with partners like UNFPA, government and other stake holders to implement the MISP including family planning services.

In Bangladesh, we are working with FPAB in the districts of Cox's Bazar and Bandarban.

IPPF, FPAB and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are working with the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and planning a co-ordinated effort to provide SRH services to the affected population.

Maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality is preventable even during disasters, we just need to wake up to the fact that SRH is a priority and it is everybody's right.

The minister made this comment at the launching ceremony of 'Millennium Development Goals: Bangladesh Progress Report-2013' at NEC-2 conference room at Planning Commission in the city.

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are eight international development goals that were established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration.

All 189 United Nations member states at the time (there are 193 currently) and at least 23 international organisations committed to help achieve the following MDGs by 2015.

Out of eight MDS Bangladesh so far achieved successes in eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equity and empowering women, reducing child mortality and improving maternal health.

""I firmly believe Bangladesh will be able to achieve other goals of the MDGs from the period of 2015 to 2030. To gain the objective, we are more committed and more prepared,"" Muhith told the ceremony.

Now, the people of the country are conscious more than any other time and they are marching towards development,"" the Finance Minister said while unveiling the report.

The finance minister said: ""Our achievement is satisfactory and we hope the indicators that we are yet to attain will be realised by next phase.""

The MDGs yet to be reached by Bangladesh are combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development.

He said the country has been able to overcome the political instability in the journey of attaining the indicators.

The United Nations Millennium Declaration 2000 marked a strong commitment to the right to development, to peace and security, to gender equality, to eradication of many dimensions of poverty and to sustainable human development.

""We know how to take the turnaround. Obviously Bangladesh will achieve the goals set for the least developed countries (LDCs)"", Minister said.

Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal was present in the ceremony as Chief Guest. Planning Commission's General Economic Division (GED) member Dr. Shamshul Alam presented the keynote paper in the programme.

However, progress report showed that areas like combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability developing a global partnership for development deserve more attention.

Poverty rate has decreased more in the present decade than the past decade, he added.

It has been possible to lessen the poverty rate from 56.7 per cent in 1991-1992 to 31.5 per cent in 2010 due to comprehensive growth. According to the last household income and expenditure survey-2010, poverty has decreased at an average rate of 1.74 per cent from 2000 to 2010 and the existing poverty rate is 26.2 per cent.

Among others, Prime Minister's Economic Affairs Adviser Dr. Moshiur Rahman, Planning Division Secretary Bhuiyan Shafiqul Islam and Economic Relation Department (ERD) Secretary Mohammad Mejbah Uddin and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Country Director Pauline Tamesis were present in the ceremony.

They came up with the demand at the National Conference of Sex Workers- 2014 jointly organized by Durjoy Nari Shangha and Bangladesh Women's Health Coalition in the city's Kazi Bashir Auditorium at Mohanagar Natyamancha. ""There are about 78, 300 sex-workers across the country and 41 per cent of them are floating. However, 54 per cent are working in different brothels and 5 per cent are working at residential hotels,"" said HIV AIDS Programme Manager of Save the Children Moushumi Amin in her keynote paper.

On the other hand, the Chief Guest of the programme Prof Dr M Shah Alam, member of Bangladesh Law Commission, said that government should recognize the sex workers as the citizens of the country. The speakers demanded assurances of education, health facilities including other human rights for the children of sex-workers and prevent them to come in this trade.

""According to the draft of the Disparity Abolition Act-2014, to deprive any child from education and medical facilities for its mother's profession is a punishable offense,"" reiterated Dr Alam. Barrister Sara Hossain said, ""Sex workers remain neglected in the society till now and are deprived of their due facilities ...there is no proper rehabilitation system for them after any eviction.""

About 700 sex-workers across the country joined the conference, where they demanded a separate law for them to ensure their rights in the society.

Ulla Muller, is the President and Chief Executive Officer of EngenderedHealth, a leading global women's health organisation. Very recently she came to Bangladesh and visited differnt parts of the country to know about present status of women's rights, especially, their reproductive health.

During her visit she went to the remote rural villages of Bangladesh to meet with the patients suffering from fistula and other health ailments.

Besides she also talked with the women who are satisfied with Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive and Permanent Method acceptors and cured obstetric fistula patients and visited family planning facilities in Jessore and Dhaka.

She also met different government and UN officials to discuss the possible measures to combat this situation.

Ms Muller has been a lifelong advocate for the rights of women and girls and is a thought leader in human rights, poverty alleviation, and women's sexual and reproductive health

Her visit will provide more guidance to population and obstetric fistula programmes of Bangladesh.

The Daily Observer on Sunday approached Ulla Muller to know about her observations about women's reproductive health and especially, Obstetric fistula as the disease is a common predicament for Bangladeshi women in rural areas.

The Daily Observer: How do you review the reproductive health rights of women in Bangladesh?

Ulla Muller: Women's reproductive health right is a significant phenomenon for upholding women's right. Without it establishing women rights is not possible. And when this right is not ensured, rather other's decisions are imposed on women, then it is nothing but a modern form of slavery; their human rights are abused and violated. Women must have their right to choose their partner, how many children they will have, this is a human right. Bangladesh has got remarkeble progresss in many areas such as less maternity death but still there are a few areas where we need to work. According to a research report conducted by EngenderedHealth Bangladesh, at least two thousands women get affected with fistula every year. At the same time, two women are being affected with obstetric fistula in every one thousand married women.

Observer: How could a women or girl could be free from such modern form of slavery?

Ulla Muller: At first, they must know about their rights. Violation or abuse could occur due to lack of information and lack of education. For this reason, girls and women need to be educated. Having been well- equipped with education, they would have to be financially solvent and then take their own decisions. Only then, can we think of ensuring reproductive health standard and once a women has the reproductive right, then she will take the decisions -how many children she will give birth to. It will not come either from her husband or from her in -laws.

Observer: Could you elaborate why this significant number of women folks is being caught by fistula?

Ulla Muller: The trend of these diseases is being shown to the young mothers who get married at thier early age. If a girl get married at the age of 14-15 and become mother at this very early age, when they hardly know about pre-and- post-pregnancy care, which is very complicated, most of these mothers get caught by fistula.

To prevent this, we need to raise a mass awareness in the rural areas where most young girls and mothers lack scopes to get access to reproductive health care.

I think EngenderedHealth and other development organisations should work in partnership with government so that we can save the lives of young mothers just communicating with them and giving them necessary information. That will bring a great impact on their lives.

Observer: You know this year Bangladesh has hosted the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia Pacific region. Could you share your views in regards of HIV/ AIDS in Bangladesh?

Ulla Muller: Still Bangladesh has low risk in regards of HIV/ AIDs. But at the same time, lots of males are also going abroad to work. There sometimes they get sexually involved without taking any precautions. This is a high risk for his partner who stays at home. So continued awareness programme is needed to prevent it. And we should not forget that Bangaldesh also has a significant number of Injected drug userers, which also poses a serious threat of spreading HIV/ AIDS.

Observer: To uphold women's rights including reproductive right for women in Bangladesh what are the big challenges?

Ulla Muller: I think the existing traditional norms and values will be big challenges for Bangladesh to establishing women's rights. Even some superstitions lead women to shy away from achieving their rights. Male partners should realise and understand all things including present situation of women and their core problems due to lack of reproductive health right. And in this field government and development organisations need to work together extensively, only then can we expect a positive change in our society.

Observer: Could you share about your organisation's activities?

Ulla Muller: EngenderHealth is a leading global women's health organisation with more than 70 years of experience in improving the quality of reproductive health, family planning, maternal health and HIV/ AIDS services. EngenderHealth is also committed to ensuring that every pregnancy is planned, every child is wanted, and every mother has the best chance of survival. We train health care professionals and partner with governments and communities in nearly 20 countries around the world.

GSK profits soar despite US tax change,,,None,"LONDON, Feb 8: British drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline said Wednesday that net profits jumped 70 per cent last year on bumper sales, despite a fourth-quarter loss that was partly sparked by US tax changes.

The annual performance was lifted by sales growth across its three main businesses, which comprise pharmaceuticals, vaccines and consumer healthcare.

Earnings won another boost from a lower accounting charge on the falling valuation of some of its HIV and vaccine activities.

GSK was buoyed also by a Brexit-hit weak pound, which made its exports cheaper for customers using stronger currencies.

Profits after tax rallied to around £1.5 billion (1.7 billion euros, $2.1 billion) last year, GSK said in a result statement.

Transgender community deserves attention,"Though a part of human being, Hijras (known as transgender) are leading an inhuman life in our country. Their sufferings know no bound. In our society, people have reservation about Hijras who are misunderstood and unaccepted in the society. If any Hijra is born to a family, the family",,2015-10-22 00:00:00,"Transgender community deserves attention Md Sazedul Islam Published :Thursday, 22 October, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 21

Hijras face violence, discrimination and rejection also from workplaces, educational institutions and society. They often cannot access the same services and rights as other citizens, and are vulnerable to poorer health. Being rejected, they take shelter among other Hijras. They have a Guru and remain under the Guru.

The social identity of Hijras is based on commitment to their way of life such as allegiance to a guru, to the pooling of earnings and submission to group rules. Their own communities, centred on their gurus, are the social worlds in which they live and protect themselves from the extremely marginalised position they hold in Bangladesh society today.

Hijras are stigmatised people. So, like all other stigmatised people, they are marginalised and have to lead their life in a different pattern. Usually they cannot mix with general people. They have no normal sexual organ but they have sexual desires. They fulfil their desire in different ways. Hijras in Bangladesh are predominantly Muslims. There are some Hindus too. The community is actually an amalgam of many religions.

In every sector, including health, education, housing and employment, they face extreme discrimination. Disowned by the family, the state and the society, they are sometimes found to be involved in resorting to extortion. Hijras face prejudice at every turn. Marked out by their sexual difference, they are hounded out of schools, and hence lack the necessary qualifications to get proper jobs. It's almost impossible for them to become educated, to get a passport, or even to open a bank account.

The third gender or transgender is an identity-based category for people who do not identify themselves as either male or female. This may include people who want to perform or want to be presented as a gender that is different than the one which was assigned to them at birth, based on genitalia or other criteria. It can also include people who do not feel the male or female gender roles that their culture dictates in terms of social, sexual or gender role preference.

Hijras or hermaphrodites are people with ambiguous genitalia. Also called intersexed, hermaphroditism is primarily a medical condition which results from multifarious biological factors. The term 'intersexed' is reserved to refer to a somatic condition in which the hermaphroditic person is supposed to posses both masculine and feminine traits.

Hijras of Bangladesh regard themselves as people incapable of sexual sensation. They also claim to have neither a male nor female genitalia. They wear women's clothing such as sari, salwar kameez, and dance and sing, in general, behave as women. In Bangladesh, this community remains socially excluded, living on the fringes of society. Most make a living by singing and dancing at weddings or childbirth, many have moved to begging and prostitution.

There are no authentic statistics on how many Hijras are there in Bangladesh. According to newspaper reports, the number varies from 30,000 to 150,000. A decision was made by the government of Bangladesh acknowledging the Hijra as third gender on November 11, 2013, but their condition is yet to be improved. Hijra community in the country is discriminated against, only due to their sexual identity. Lack of education is a major problem for them, because of which they are not aware of their rights. Due to their low educational status, lack of alternative profession, associated stigma, discrimination and violence, Hijras are mostly at risk of getting infected as well as transmitting HIV to their clients. While overall HIV prevalence remains under 0.1 per cent among the general population in Bangladesh, there are risk factors that could fuel the spread of HIV AIDS among high-risk groups. Prompt and dynamic action is needed to reinforce the quality and coverage of HIV prevention programmes, particularly among the high risk group, including Hijras.

We cannot build a better Bangladesh by ignoring and excluding a large number of people. So, necessary steps should be taken to solve the problems of the community. Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS), a NGO working on sexual minorities, placed demands for protecting the rights of the community. The demands include commitment to ensure support from different sectors of the government, job opportunities for Hijras, ensure free health services from government hospitals and community clinics, ensure voting card from city corporation to all Hijras, support in renting dwelling places and lease/allocation of the khas land for the community and proper religious ritual after death.

BSWS also mentioned a number of challenges, which need to be addressed. These are: misconception about Hijra community in the mainstream society, including media, lack of comprehensive programmes to supplement the gazette notification, lack of acceptance of the community in the mainstream society, no provision for third gender in government form-formats, subdued and sarcastic presentation of Hijras in cinemas and media and almost no job provision with Hijra identity.

We need to address and concerns of human rights abuse and denial of sexual health rights, and provide a right-based approach to health and social services for the most stigmatized and vulnerable populations in Bangladesh. We need to ensure the legal rights of transgender people in the state as there is no room for discrimination in the law or constitution. Immediate actions need to be taken to get equal opportunity in education, treatment and employment and introduction of quotas in educational institutes, public services and parliament as well. A wholesome law need to be formed soon that would address each problem faced by the community individually and target to solve them. Creating new employment opportunities for the transgender individuals is necessary. Suitable employment and developing effective strategies need to be formulated. Article 28 (1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh states 'The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race caste, sex or place of birth'. Building a society where everyone is treated with proper respect regardless of sex, age and religion is our constitutional right. Raising awareness and change of attitude of people towards Hijras would help reintegrate them into the mainstream of the society.

If they are provided support and the right environment to nurture their true potential, they can be a productive part of the society, contributing to national development. We should accept the issue as diversity not as abnormality. They should be given a different gender identity in order to get rid of identity conflict. Short term projects for the improvement for the Hijra community cannot be a solution, but a change in social perspective is necessary in order to ensure a proper place in the family and all other places of society.r

"Annually 70,000 Bangladeshis die from Tuberculosis",,,None,"Speakers at a health conference on Wednesday said respiratory diseases cause a significant health burden both globally and in Bangladesh and it affects all aged groups.

A large number of people have been suffering from different respiratory diseases like Asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), TB and lung malignancy due to rapid increase of air population, urbanization, unplanned industrialization, high level indoor air pollution, use of tobacco products and HIV epidemic, they said.

""About 70 lakh people are affected by Asthma in the country. Annually, 70,000 Bangladeshis die from Tuberculosis. By 2020, respiratory diseases will be the third leading cause of death globally, so it is high time to take steps to face this challenge,"" said one of the speakers.

George Michael regretted going to war with Sony,,,None,"George Michael regretted going to war with Sony

The star took Sony to court in 1992, claiming he had little control over his work, with the company treating him as ""no more than a piece of software"".

He eventually lost the case, which put his career on hold for five years.

""It dented the armour in his career in America,"" said Michael's friend and former manager, David Austin, who produced the new Channel 4 documentary.

""He was a guy who was firing on all four cylinders and it just, it blew that candle out in the US without a doubt.""

""He says in the film, and when we were talking about the court case and how we were going to handle it, and I didn't realise this at all, but he turned around to me and said how he regretted it.""

The Sony trial coincided with a devastating period in Michael's personal life, during which his partner Anselmo Feleppa discovered he was HIV positive and, later, died of an Aids-related brain haemorrhage.

In the documentary, which Michael was working on 48 hours before his death last Christmas, the star reveals he never fully recovered from Feleppa's death.

He describes the Brazilian designer as his ""saviour"", who helped him feel comfortable about his sexuality.

""It's very hard to be proud of your own sexuality when it hasn't brought you any joy,"" he says. ""Once it's associated with joy and love it's easy to be proud of who you are.""

But only a few months into their relationship, Feleppa developed a flu that wouldn't go away. He was advised to take a test and was diagnosed with Aids over Christmas 1991.

""I was absolutely devastated to find out he had a terminal illness... just devastated,"" Michael says in the documentary, which he co-directed.

"$25 a year per woman can prevent most maternal, newborn deaths!","Spending US$25 per woman each year would dramatically reduce maternal and newborn deaths. a joint report of two renowned organisations say. A new report, the joint work of two renowned organizations, finds a staggering lack of basic sexual and reproductive health services in developing countries. The report, released by the",,2014-12-06 00:00:00,"$25 a year per woman can prevent most maternal, newborn deaths! Banani Mallick Published : Saturday, 6 December, 2014, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 12 Spending US$25 per woman each year would dramatically reduce maternal and newborn deaths. a joint report of two renowned organisations say.

A new report, the joint work of two renowned organizations, finds a staggering lack of basic sexual and reproductive health services in developing countries.

The report, released by the Guttmacher Institute and UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, recently analyzed data from a wide range of sources, including survey data from women in developing countries, to document the number of women who lack services, what it would cost to meet their needs, and the benefits of meeting these needs.

Guttamacher Institute is a non-profit organization which works to advance reproductive health. The institute operates in the US and globally through an interrelated programme of social science research, policy analysis and public education.

The report suggests that about tens of millions of women do not receive the basic pregnancy and delivery care for their health and their newborn babies.

""Over the past two decades, we have achieved striking progress in making pregnancy and childbirth safer in developing countries. Despite those gains, these new findings make clear that universal access to sexual and reproductive health services must remain a global health priority requiring urgent attention,"" said Ann Starrs, President and CEO of the Guttmacher Institute.

The study calculates that it would cost on average $25 per woman aged 15 to 49, roughly double the current level of spending, to provide a package of essential sexual and reproductive health services to all women in developing regions each year.

The amount of money will include contraceptive services, pregnancy and newborn care, services for pregnant women living with HIV, including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the virus, and treatment for four other sexually transmitted infections.

""This report is an urgent call to action for increased investments in sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning. These investments save lives, empower women and girls, strengthen health systems and have a profound and lasting impact on development,"" said Dr Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA.

""We must ensure the quality of services and availability of a full range of choices so women and men can get the health care they need.""

Providing this basic package of services to all women who need them in developing countries would have a dramatic impact. If all women wanting to avoid pregnancy used a modern contraceptive method, the number of unintended pregnancies would drop by 70 per cent and unsafe abortions by 74 per cent.

The research report suggest that the number of women dying from pregnancy-related causes would drop by two thirds, from 290,000 to 96,000, newborn deaths would drop by more than three-fourths, from 2.9 million to 660,000, transmission of HIV from mothers to newborns would be nearly eliminated.

The report, which presents findings from Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, found that the situation varies widely by region.

According to the analysis, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the average annual cost of providing a woman with the needed health care would be $31, compared with $14 per woman in Asia.

However, costs would be significantly higher-$76 per woman-in sub-Saharan Africa, the subregion with the greatest need for services and where health systems are generally weakest, the report discloses.

Currently, of the 125 million women in developing countries who give birth every year, there are 54 million who do not receive adequate antenatal care, 43 million do not deliver in a health facility, 21 million women and 33 million newborns do not receive care for medical complications, 550,000 pregnant women living with HIV do not receive treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Differences within regions are also considerable. In East Africa, 42 per cent of women deliver in a health facility, compared with 62 per cent in Middle Africa and 87 per cent in Southern Africa. In Asia, just 32 per cent of the poorest women deliver in facilities, compared with 92 per cent of the wealthiest women.","['newborn', 'deaths', 'reproductive', 'cent', 'services', 'million', 'care', 'prevent', '25', 'maternal', 'report', 'developing', 'women', 'woman', 'health']","$25 a year per woman can prevent most maternal, newborn deaths!

Bangladeshi-Myanmar refugee marriages increase despite ban,,,None,"The number of marriages between Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi citizens has increased in the last one and half months, despite a government ban, apart from the health risk the Bangladeshi spouse is exposed to in such marriages.

Already a couple of HIV/ AIDS infected Rohingya refugees have been identified in various refugee camps after they were forced to flee Myanmar following August 25 army operation in the Rakhain State.

Most of the time Rohingya refugees tend to get married to a Bangladesh citizen in the hope of achieving citizenship.

Realizing that the government on Wednesday issued a directive asking marriage registrars to check the nationality of the bride and bridegroom before registering marriages in Cox's Bazar, Rangamati, Bandarban and Chittagong districts.

The measure was necessitated by the report of widespread flouting of the ban on marriages between Bangladeshi citizens and Myanmar refugees.

Terming the aforesaid areas as special zones, the Law and Justice Division notification said the tendency of Bangladeshi men towards marrying Rohingya women from Myanmar has increased noticeably and some marriage registrars are involved in such 'criminal activities.'

Talking to the Daily Observer, Senior Assistant Secretary GM Najmus Shahadat, who signed the notification, said the marriages between Bangladeshi men and Rohingya girl/ women have recently increased.

""A good number of marriages are taking place almost every day with the help of unscrupulous marriage registrars. The government is very much serious about stopping such weddings,"" he said.

He also added that through the notification, they had asked the concerned marriage registrars to check the national identity cards to confirm nationality of the concerned men and women.

""Strong actions would be taken against marriage registrars for any negligence in this regard,"" the notification said.

The Ministry also directed the marriage registrars of concerned districts to monitor the situation.

It has been found that the guardians of Rohingya refugees are employing this strategy to get their daughters married off to Bangladeshi citizens so that they could stay in Bangladsh permanently.

Abdul Quddus, a resident of nearby Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya, told this correspondent over phone that a significant number of girl child and adolescents are in various camps.

""They are under the constant threat of sexual abuse and trafficking. They also lack adequate food, shelter and sanitation. The parents are very worried about their safety. So if they find any opportunity to secure their daughters and sons future they give their consent without thinking twice,"" he said.

It has been found that Rohingya parents do not hesitate to settle marriage of a young girl with an aged Bangladeshi man with a hope that they could stay here along with their family permanently.

Cox's Bazar Superintendent of Police (SP) AKM Iqbal Hossain said they had been trying to stop Rohingya -Bangladeshi marriages.

Breastfeeding: the foundation of life,,,None,"Breastfeeding: the foundation of life

Evidence shows that the right nutrition during the 1,000-day window can:

v Save more than 1 million lives each year.

v Significantly reduce the human and economic burden of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV and AIDS.

v Reduce the risk of developing various non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and other chronic conditions later in life.

v Improve an individual's educational achievement and earning potential.

v Increase a country's gross domestic product by at least 2-3 percent annually.

Suchana:

Department for International Development (DFID) of the government of the United Kingdom and the European Union started funding, 'Suchana' is a six-year programme that aims to prevent chronic malnutrition in children in the first 1,000 days of life, by addressing the multiple causes of malnutrition through nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions synergistically. Suchana is working with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) staff across a various line of departments and Ministries to facilitate project implementation.

To this end, Suchana field workers are working astoundingly hard to deal from their pregnancy to delivery. In addition, looking after both mother and children. In our program, we have trained our workers thoroughly in nutrition, facilitation skill and counseling for about a week.Each child under 2 years of age, pregnant women and their mother in law or the decision maker of the family (father) are separated into little groups consistently and discussed around 12 nutrition-related topics.

In addition to that, to monitor the growth according to the age of the children, 'Growth Monitoring Promotion' sessions are being conducted routinely every month.Significant reduction in stunting (additional 6% in three years) among under 2 years children in Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts of Sylhet division and catalyze support across Govt. and other stakeholders for a coordinated multisectoral approach in Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts and beyond.

Projects key outcomes are: Household food security status (HH dietary diversity and consumption of nutritious food) improved and sustained through GoB and market systems. Improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and maternal, newborn and child health (MCHN) practices and improved systems to sustain changed practices. Strengthened coordination and governance for multi-sectoral nutrition Programs at national & sub-national levels. The consortium lead is Save the Children International. Technical Partners of the programme:WorldFish, Helen Keller International, iDE& implementing partners are: RDRS, FIVDB, CNRS.

As a global goal for optimal maternal and child health and nutrition, all women should be enabled to practice exclusive breastfeeding and all infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to 4-6 months of age. This child-feeding ideal is to be achieved by creating an appropriate environment of awareness and support so that women can breastfeed in this manner.

v Increase women's confidence in their ability to breastfeed.

v empowerment of women can helpful for the removal of constraints and influences that manipulate perceptions and behavior towards breastfeeding.

v Furthermore, obstacles to breastfeeding within the health system, the workplace, and the community must be eliminated.

v Measures should be taken to ensure that women are adequately nourished for their optimal health and that of their families. Furthermore, ensuring that all women have access to family planning information and services allows them to sustain breastfeeding and avoid shortened birth intervals that may compromise their health and nutritional status, and that of their children.

v All healthcare staff should be trained in the skills necessary to implement these breastfeeding policies.

v Actions should be taken for protecting the breastfeeding rights of working women and established means for its enforcement.

Pregnancy and infancy are critically important periods for brain development for a child. Mothers and babies need good nutrition to lay the foundation for the child's future cognitive, motor and social skills, school success, and productivity. Children with the restricted development of these skills during early life are at risk for later neurological problems, poor school achievement, early school drop-out, low-skilled employment, and poor care of their own children, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty and malnutrition.Evidence shows that the right nutrition during the 1,000-day window can:v Save more than 1 million lives each year.v Significantly reduce the human and economic burden of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV and AIDS.v Reduce the risk of developing various non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and other chronic conditions later in life.v Improve an individual's educational achievement and earning potential.v Increase a country's gross domestic product by at least 2-3 percent annually.Suchana:Department for International Development (DFID) of the government of the United Kingdom and the European Union started funding, 'Suchana' is a six-year programme that aims to prevent chronic malnutrition in children in the first 1,000 days of life, by addressing the multiple causes of malnutrition through nutrition specific and nutrition sensitive interventions synergistically. Suchana is working with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) staff across a various line of departments and Ministries to facilitate project implementation.To this end, Suchana field workers are working astoundingly hard to deal from their pregnancy to delivery. In addition, looking after both mother and children. In our program, we have trained our workers thoroughly in nutrition, facilitation skill and counseling for about a week.Each child under 2 years of age, pregnant women and their mother in law or the decision maker of the family (father) are separated into little groups consistently and discussed around 12 nutrition-related topics.In addition to that, to monitor the growth according to the age of the children, 'Growth Monitoring Promotion' sessions are being conducted routinely every month.Significant reduction in stunting (additional 6% in three years) among under 2 years children in Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts of Sylhet division and catalyze support across Govt. and other stakeholders for a coordinated multisectoral approach in Sylhet and Moulvibazar districts and beyond.Projects key outcomes are: Household food security status (HH dietary diversity and consumption of nutritious food) improved and sustained through GoB and market systems. Improved infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and maternal, newborn and child health (MCHN) practices and improved systems to sustain changed practices. Strengthened coordination and governance for multi-sectoral nutrition Programs at national & sub-national levels. The consortium lead is Save the Children International. Technical Partners of the programme:WorldFish, Helen Keller International, iDE& implementing partners are: RDRS, FIVDB, CNRS.As a global goal for optimal maternal and child health and nutrition, all women should be enabled to practice exclusive breastfeeding and all infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk from birth to 4-6 months of age. This child-feeding ideal is to be achieved by creating an appropriate environment of awareness and support so that women can breastfeed in this manner.v Increase women's confidence in their ability to breastfeed.v empowerment of women can helpful for the removal of constraints and influences that manipulate perceptions and behavior towards breastfeeding.v Furthermore, obstacles to breastfeeding within the health system, the workplace, and the community must be eliminated.v Measures should be taken to ensure that women are adequately nourished for their optimal health and that of their families. Furthermore, ensuring that all women have access to family planning information and services allows them to sustain breastfeeding and avoid shortened birth intervals that may compromise their health and nutritional status, and that of their children.v All healthcare staff should be trained in the skills necessary to implement these breastfeeding policies.v Actions should be taken for protecting the breastfeeding rights of working women and established means for its enforcement.For long-term national and individual well-being, we should support mothers who wish to follow this natural practice, removing any barriers that stand in their way.Whenever we are about to build a house, we give prior to the materials needed for a strong infrastructure so our next generations could live there for decades.

WASHINGTON, Feb 9: President Barack Obama signed into law Monday a measure aimed at expanding electricity to millions of households in sub-Saharan Africa, a measure supporters say will save lives and accelerate growth on the continent.

The Electrify Africa Act, which unanimously passed the House of Representatives and Senate, leverages partnerships with the private sector in order to bring first-time electricity access to some 50 million people in underserved parts of Africa.

Virtually no new US federal funds are allocated for the project, which instead will use a system of loan guarantees to add 20,000 megawatts of electricity to the continent's grid by 2020.

Access to power is a fundamental development challenge in Africa, and boosting it will stimulate economic growth and improve access to education and public health, the bill's backers argue.

""It's a game-changer for small businesses that have to close at dark, and school children who are often forced to study by dangerous, inefficient kerosene lamps,"" said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce.

""And too many families resort to using charcoal or other toxic fuel sources, whose fumes cause more deaths than HIV/AIDS and malaria, combined.""

Women's Own Desk Violence against women is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women specifically because they are women. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states that ""violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women"" and that ""violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."" Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, declared in a 2006 report posted on the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) website that ""violence against women and girls is a problem of pandemic proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.""

In order to realize the full scope of violence against women, it is necessary to consider some of its section parts. Each of these practices and all other forms of violence against women, are horrific as well as criminal and must be condemned. This is not an exhaustive list but a summary of the major types of violence against women.



Rape: Rape is forced sexual assault, unwanted sexual intercourse. Rape knows no borders as it affects females in every country in the world. In contexts of war and conflict, rape is prevalent. Women are disproportionately the victims of rape, most commonly at the hands of men. In addition to psychological harm resulting from the act, rape may cause physical injury, or have additional effects on the victim, such as acquiring of a sexually transmitted infection or becoming pregnant.



Sexual harassment: Sexual harassment is unwanted sexual contact or attempted rape. Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, in the home or within the community and should never be treated as anything less than a serious offense. Perpetrators may be family members or trusted members of the community, but this does not change the severity or danger of their actions. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence defines sexual harassment as: ""any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment''. Not only girls, widow women are also a subject of harassment. A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as widow inheritance. On the other hand, sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches.



Domestic violence: Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person in a domestic context against another, such as in marriage in the home within a family. Domestic violence can take a number of forms including physical, emotional, verbal, economic and sexual abuse. Globally, a wife is more commonly the victim of domestic violence. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, insufficient financial resources, fear, shame or to protect children.



Dowry murder: Dowry murder is a practice in which a bride's husband and/or in-laws kill her because her parents are unable to deliver the full amount or meet an increased demand of her dowry. It has also been reported that dowry demands have played and continued to play an important role in women being burned to death. Dowry murder is a brutal practice where a woman is killed by her husband or in-laws because her family cannot meet their demands for dowry a payment made to a woman's in-laws upon her marriage as a gift to her new family.



Acid violence: Acid violence is the deliberate use of acid to attack another human being. The victims of acid violence are overwhelmingly women, and attackers often target the head and face in order to maim, disfigure and blind. Acid assault survivors also face many mental health issues upon recovery. In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women.



Forced marriage: A forced marriage is age in which one or both of the parties are married against their will. The customs of bride price and dowry that exist in many parts of the world contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.



Honor killing: Honor killing is another violence against women. It refers to the murder of women due to their perceived disgrace to the family's or community's ""honour"" for things such as accused premarital sex, accused adultery, inappropriate behavior such as leaving the house without a male relative, and even rape. Preservation of honour is usually veiled in religious language, a dangerous manipulation of religion to justify an inexcusable practice. Women have been publicly stoned to death and burned.



Violence during pregnancy: Violence before and during pregnancy has serious health consequences for both mother and child. It leads to high-risk pregnancies and pregnancy-related problems, including miscarriage, pre-term labour and low birth weight.

According to Human rights organization Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) statistics in Bangladesh from January to December 2014 total 48 women were the victim of acid throwing, 13 cases of throwing attempt were failed and not mentioned cases are 18. As a victim of sexual harassment 241 women were harassed, not able to attending school for the fare of stalkers were 8 women, murdered due to protest 7 women and suicide for sexual harassment were 14. On the other hand, domestic violence victim were 488 women and failed case 261. Murdered by husband 262 women, murdered by husband's family member 79 women and 84 women committed suicide for domestic violence. Rape victim were 707, gang rape 208, death after rape 68, suicide 13 and attempt to rape 81. Dowry related violence were 296, failed case 139, death after psychical torture for dowry - 163 and suicide after psychical torture - 11 women.

In 2014 World Health Organization says recent global prevalence figures indicate that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence. Globally, around 38 per cent of murders of women are committed by intimate partners.

UN Women says according to a 2013 global review of available data, 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or some national violence studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime from an intimate partner.

Trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. Women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labour worldwide, and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation.

In the United States, 83 per cent of girls in grades 8 through 11 (aged 12 to 16) have experienced some form of sexual harassment in public schools.

In New Delhi, a 2010 study found that 66 per cent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment between two and five times.

Research conducted in different countries has documented associations between HIV and physical and/or sexual violence, both as a risk factor for HIV infection and as a potential consequence of being identified as living with HIV. A decade of cross-sectional research from African countries, including Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa and more recently, India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV.

In the United States, 11.8 per cent of new HIV infections among women more than 20 years old during the previous year were attributed to intimate partner violence.

High numbers of women report suffering violence since the age of 15: in Denmark 52 per cent, Finland 47 per cent, and Sweden 46 per cent of women say they have suffered physical or sexual violence.

Studies were adjusted for differences in design and methodological quality. The highest rates of partner violence, estimated between 54per cent and 78 per cent, were found in central sub-Saharan Africa, but even high-income regions in Asia, North America and western Europe had rates above 15 per cent. These jump considerably when sexual non-partner violence is factored in.

The studies still have gaps. For example, data about partner violence from central sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and southern Latin America, and for women over 49, were scarce. In addition, the studies did not assess emotional violence, and though estimates did not consider partners' gender, most research studies solicited information only on male partners. In addition, many homicide reports do not include information about perpetrators' relationships to their victims.

Women's empowerment and awareness raising and community mobilization, including through media and social media are important component of an effective prevention strategy against women violence.

Medical wastes pose serious health hazard,,,None,"Medical wastes thrown and dumped in front of every hospital are causing serious hazard to health of people, say experts.

The rise in the number of private hospitals and clinics has worsened the situation.

Medical experts said of the various kinds of wastes the liquid ones are more dangerous as they mix with other components through different drainage systems and fall into the river posing a serious threat to human health and aquatic flora and fauna.

Different transmission of vector-borne and pathogenic viruses and bacteria diseases could lead to an outbreak of infectious diseases.

In the last few decades, the healthcare sector in Dhaka has witnessed an exponential growth. The city dwellers, however, claim that the quality of medical services is far from acceptable.

Issues such as failure to dispose of waste and dust pollution, which are internationally recognized indicators, have put Dhaka at the very bottom of the Global livability index in recent consecutive years.

Dr Lenin Chowdhury said the untreated medical wastes spread malodor and various diseases causing infectious diseases.

""All types of post-delivery products and syringes are very dangerous. The first one mixes with drinking water causing several deadly diseases. And using syringes could cause different severe diseases including HIV and AIDs,"" he said.

The other thing is the disposal items. When dissolved it pollutes soil and that virtually becomes breeding place for other diseases, he said. Therefore, all medical wastes should be managed properly because it has been reported that medical waste poses an increasingly high risk for every creature.

Asked what steps should be taken, he said proper waste management strategy should be devised to ensure health and environmental safety.

Besides, training programme on safe handling of medical waste should also be organized for medical staff by hospitals so that these risks can be averted.

Meanwhile, the High Court on Sunday asked the government to explain as to why directives will not be issued to set up medical waste processing plants in every administrative division of the country.

Dr Abdul Matin, General Secretary of Bangldesh Paribesh Andolon, elaborating about the medical wastes said there are three types of medical wastes: general medical wastes like patients' food, drinks, medicine, foils; sharp items like abandoned surgical instrument and knife; stitching items like needles and strings etc.

But most dangerous items that cause pollution and pose serious threat to health are pus soaked gauze bandage, dressing materials, hand gloves, nasal pipes and respiratory pipes etc, he said.

He also noted that in Dhaka city around 5000 tonnes of garbage are dumped daily where 200 tonnes are medical wastes.

""Medical Wastes should have different disposal systems but in reality it mostly does not happen. Most of the chambers, clinics and hospitals are not adopting this policy,"" he said.

Suggesting about the collection of the medical wastes, he said medical wastes should be separated at the bed side area using three different bins and be disposed through three different channels, he said.

""But now all the wastes, general and medical, are being thrown into a same single municipal dustbin.""

In developed countries, technologies like autoclaving and incineration are used for the final disposal of medical wastes. Dhaka City Corporation along with Prism Bangladesh, a non government organization, is working together to collect medical wastes.

However, state-run organizations like Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha, Department of Environment, Department of Explosives, Fire Services and Civil Defense, Dhaka District Administration, Department of Environment and Dhaka Metropolitan Police are responsible for keeping Dhaka clean.","['diseases', 'wastes', 'hazard', 'pose', 'hospitals', 'dhaka', 'waste', 'medical', 'different', 'items', 'serious', 'health']","Medical wastes thrown and dumped in front of every hospital are causing serious hazard to health of people, say experts.
Therefore, all medical wastes should be managed properly because it has been reported that medical waste poses an increasingly high risk for every creature.

One under-15 girl married in every 7 seconds: Report,,,None,"One under-15 girl is married in every seven seconds globally, according to a new analysis by Save the Children which reveals the scale of the threat posed by child marriage.





Girls as young as ten are being forced to marry men, often a lot older than themselves, in countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, India and Somalia.





The report by Save the Children, Every Last Girl: Free to live, free to learn, free from harm, has ranked countries in an index according to child marriage, schooling, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and number of female MPs.





Bangladesh has 20 percent female MPs while the under-18 marriage rate is 52.2 percent and schooling under aged 16 is 73.5 percent, the index shows.





Countries at the bottom of the index include Niger, Chad, Central African Republic, Mali and Somalia. Countries at the top include

Sweden, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium. The UK ranks 15th out of 144 countries.





Save the Childrenâ€™s new CEO Kevin Watkins said: â€˜Child marriage isnâ€™t just a form of discrimination, itâ€™s a form of violenceâ€™.





â€œForcing girls to marry much older men robs them of their freedom and amounts to sexual slavery. Instead of being in school, married girls face domestic violence, abuse and rape. They fall pregnant and are exposed to STIs, including HIV. Bearing children before their bodies are ready means girls suffer complicated deliveries and even death.â€





The report also reveals that girls from poor families are more likely to be married early than their richer peers.





India has the highest number of child marriages of any country, partly owing to the large size of its population, with 47 percent of girls married under 18 - around 24.6 million.

How our immune system has shaped world history,,,None,"How our immune system has shaped world history

These instruments of death have in effect directed the development of one of the most underappreciated parts of human biology: our immune system. Daniel Davis's terrific book attempts to redress this understandable oversight. There's no gentle way of saying this: immunology is hard. Among the many ways we scientifically scrutinise ourselves, it doesn't have the visceral and artistic merit of anatomy, the mysteries of the mind of psychology or the scientific sex appeal of genetics. The study of the immune system is complex, intricate, meticulous and fiddly. A couple of years of immunology at university was painful enough, and as a grown-up science writer and broadcaster, I confess that I have quietly avoided immunity-related research as much as is polite.

But a good writer can make any subject thrilling. Davis is a very good writer, and my historical animosity - possibly fear - of engaging with immunology was swept away by his assured, unpretentious style. He is a consummate storyteller. He considers how we understand our bodies' natural and learned defences against every attack. There are fundamental questions here: how does the body determine self, and what is not? We ingest things all the time that are non-self, such as food, but how does the body know what is good for you and what will kill you? These are mysteries that he describes as being, or having been, solved by the Sherlockian methodologies of science.

The cover and subtitle make it look like a self-help book, with an element of health guru to it. Don't be put off - it is nothing of the sort. Or perhaps this is very deliberate, and those drawn to the mind and body shelves in bookshops might actually be exposed to some proper science writing instead. Davis bounces back and forth between the old and new. We learn about a female prisoner exchanging the death penalty for life behind bars by agreeing to have smallpox pus extracts wiped up her nose. At a brisk pace, we are taken through stories of bitter enmities and Nobel prizes strewn in among the technical cellular and molecular insights of the modern era, a world in which Davis is active. And we hear of what is yet to come, with immunotherapies, a real field that attracts hype, internet billionaires and popstar funders. Davis doesn't shy away from hard science, with B cells and T cells, and Natural Killer cells and macrophages and Toll-like receptors. Yet his is also a culturally literate description of how science is done, by people trying to push egos out of the way to answer fundamental questions.

Do not underestimate the importance of immunology. This field relates to you personally, as well as in the less solipsistic sweep of history. There's so much bunkum in popular discourse about boosting your immune system, and its relationship to diet and lifestyle, which Davis tackles head on. The best chapter concerns what we really know about how stress affects the body's ability to respond to attack (measurably and negatively), and how tai chi or laughter interact with our immunity. Answer: we don't really know, because most of the studies have been not very good.

Just the other week, a dazzling study hoiked out DNA from the teeth of some centuries-dead Aztecs, and revealed the probable cause of their deaths, and 15 million others in the 16th century. They found a Salmonella species that causes enteric fever, which indigenous Meso-Americans had never been exposed to until Europeans invaded their lands. Their immune system had not learned to fight that vicious killer. And so culture and history have been shaped by immunology, just as they have been by the plagues that have been endemic in Eurasia since Justinian's in 541-2AD.

Conversely, eradicating smallpox should be regarded as one of humankind's greatest achievements. A disease that killed inestimable millions over thousands of years was declared extinct in 1980, following the deployment of the most effective medical treatment we have ever known: vaccines. Twenty years ago, the current anti-vaccination movement began with the publication by shamed former doctor Andrew Wakefield of a mendacious study that linked vaccines with autism. There is a real threat that with climate change, cadavers bearing otherwise vanquished pathogens will thaw from the permafrost.

A terrific book by a consummate storyteller and scientific expert considers the past and future of the body's ability to fight disease and heal itselfNature wants to destroy you. Evolution has been driven by aggressive forces in which organisms will enact their livelihood at the expense of yours. Any top 10 list of the greatest killers in human history will not include war or famine, or guns or drugs. Of the voracious beasts that might feed off your flesh, lions and tigers and bears (oh my!) wouldn't even scrape into the top 20. It is the smallest things in the living world that have had the biggest impact on humankind: malaria, plague, Spanish flu, cholera, tuberculosis, HIV/Aids and smallpox. These diseases are all caused by entities unseen until modern history. From smallest to largest, Aids, smallpox and flu are triggered by viruses, which are tiny compared with the bacteria that cause cholera, plague and tuberculosis, which themselves are dwarfed by the single celled Plasmodium organisms that give us malaria - probably the single most lethal agent in our history.These instruments of death have in effect directed the development of one of the most underappreciated parts of human biology: our immune system.

Hundreds of Rohingya women being trafficked for unsocial activities,,,None,"COX'S BAZAR, Dec 27: Hundreds of Rohingya women are being trafficked from the district, according to field sources.

The members of armed forces arrested a Rohingya teenage girl and a hotel employee searching a vehicle at T&T area in Ukhia Upazila of the district. Both the arrestees introduced themselves as Bangladeshi nationals but the real fact came out after interrogation.

The hotel employee Mohammad Anwar, 40, was bringing the Rohingya girl to a hotel for unsocial activities.

Later, they were produced before the mobile court of Ukhia Upazila Nirbahi Officer Mohammad Nikaruzzaman Chowdhury who handed over the Rohingya girl to her guardians and sent the employee to 15-day jail.

On December 18, the member of armed forces detained a Rohingya teenager named Parveen, 13, when she was being trafficked from Kutupalang.

At that time, Hasina Begum, 35, was arrested for her alleged involvement in trafficking. She was sent to jail through court order.

According to the administration, the old Rohingya woman Hasina is the member of a children and women trafficking gang who trafficked several children and women earlier.

On December 1 last, a Rohingya teenage girl named Khaleda Begum, 17, was rescued while being trafficked from Balukhali-1 Rohingya camp. Two persons- Mufti Rafiqul Islam, 35, of Ashashuni Upazila in Satkhira District and Mawlana Mohammad Harunur Rashid, 37, of Betbunia were arrested for their alleged involvement in trafficking Khaleda. The girl was handed over to her parents while Rafiqul Islam and Harunur Rashid were sent to jail.

Ayesha Khatun, 30, was arrested by the members of Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) from Panchbibi frontier of Joypurhat District while being trafficked to India on November 30. Besides, police arrested Setara Begum, 15, Zaheda Begum, 16, and Shafiqa, 6, from a house in Demra of Dhaka. The traffickers brought them here from Balukhkali and Jamtali camps in Cox's Bazar for trafficking to Malaysia. The brokers were arrested at that time and the children and the women were sent back to Ukhia camp.

Earlier in the last week, two Rohingya girls Sitara Begum and Najiba Begum were detained with Bangladeshi passport. Their passports were seized and cancelled. They not only made Bangladeshi passport but also completed all formalities to go to Saudi Arabia. Later, they were sent back to Ukhia camp.

Hundreds of children and women were recovered from different areas of the country in the last four months. Nearly thousand male and female were detained in this connection.

The traffickers have been trafficking a large number of children, women and men applying different tricks every day.

Seeking anonymity, some physicians of Ukhia Health Complex said the people of the country are in great health risk for the Rohingya influx in Ukhia and Teknaf.

The Rohingyas are already infected with different diseases like HIV/AIDS, diphtheria, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, and syphilis.

Cox's Bazar is a tourist area where local and international tourists are coming every moment. So it is very shocking news that the Rohigya women have been doing prostitution business in the hotels, motels and guest houses there.

Many Rohingya women have been detected with HIV. It is hard to say how many women are bearing the disease. If their movement and location are not restricted, the whole country will fall in a great health risk, they said.

At a meeting in Ukhia recently, Ukhia Upazila Nirbahi Officer Mohammad Nikaruzzaman said that the detained Rohingyas were sent back and many of them are being trafficked showing fake identity cards, medical certificates and fake documents.

The speakers said many NGO employees are involved in Rohingya trafficking.

They also demanded bringing under vigilance the NGO vehicles that use black glasses.","['children', 'activities', 'hundreds', 'arrested', 'trafficking', 'trafficked', 'women', 'unsocial', 'ukhia', 'rohingya', 'sent', 'begum', 'girl']","COX'S BAZAR, Dec 27: Hundreds of Rohingya women are being trafficked from the district, according to field sources.

For safer blood transfusions,,,None,"For safer blood transfusions

You may need a blood transfusion for a number of reasons, including:

* to replace blood lost during major surgery, childbirth or a severe accident

* to treat anemia that has failed to respond to other treatments; anemia is a condition where a person has low levels of red blood cells

* to treat inherited blood disorders, such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anemia

* An illness that causes bleeding, such as a bleeding ulcer.

* An illness that destroys blood cells, such as hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia.

* If you have an illness in which your bone marrow doesn't make enough blood, such as aplastic anemia, you may need transfusions.

Is a blood transfusion safe?

The risks of blood transfusions include transfusion reactions (immune-related reactions), non immune reactions, and infections. Blood transfusions are safe if donated blood is carefully tested and tracked. The aim is to reduce the risk of a person being given blood contaminated with a virus, such as hepatitis C & B, or receiving blood from a blood group that's unsuitable for them. Before making a blood donation, the potential donor is asked about their health, lifestyle and history.

After blood has been donated, it's always tested for the following infections:

* hepatitis B

* hepatitis C

* HIV and AIDS

* syphilis

* human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) - a rare but potentially serious virus, which in some people can cause a type of leukaemia that's usually fatal

You may have a mild allergic reaction even if you get the correct blood type. Signs of a reaction include: fever, hives, shortness of breath, pain, fast heart rate, chills, low blood pressure.

Before receive a blood transfusion, recipient's blood is tested to determine blood type. Blood or blood components that are compatible with recipient's blood type are ordered by the doctor. This blood may be retested in the hospital laboratory to confirm its type. A sample of recipient's blood is then mixed with a sample of the donor's blood that will receive to check that no problems result, such as red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or clotting. This process of checking blood types and mixing samples of the two blood sources is called typing and cross matching.

Before actually giving the transfusion, a doctor or nurse will examine the label on the package of blood and compare it to recipient's blood type as listed on medical record. Only when all agree that this is the correct blood and that you are the correct recipient will the transfusion begin.

Sometimes a doctor will recommend that to take acetaminophen, antihistamines, or other medicines to help prevent mild reactions, like a fever or hives, from a blood transfusion. Doctors will stop a blood transfusion if they think you are having a reaction. A reaction may turn out to be mild. But at the beginning, it is hard for doctors to know whether it will be severe. Your doctor will treat a more severe reaction if one occurs.

Essentials:

* Avoid unnecessary and inappropriate transfusions.

* Preventable 'wrong blood into patient' incidents are nearly always caused by human error and may cause fatal reactions due to ABO incompatibility.

* Most mistransfusion incidents are caused by identification errors at the time of pre-transfusion blood sampling, sample handling in the laboratory, collecting the wrong component from the blood bank or transfusion to the patient.

* The identity check between patient and blood component is the crucial final opportunity to avoid potentially fatal mistransfusion.

* At every stage of the blood administration process the key elements are positive patient identification, excellent communication and good documentation. These can be enhanced by the use of electronic transfusion management systems and barcode technology.

* Hospitals should develop local transfusion policies based on national guidelines and ensure all staff involved in the clinical transfusion process is appropriately trained and competency assessed.

* Where possible, patients should give 'valid consent' for transfusion based on appropriate information and discussion, but signed consent is not a legal requirement.

* Non-essential 'out of hours' requests for transfusion and overnight administration of blood should be avoided wherever possible because of an increased risk of errors.

Early marriage not only deprives girls of education and opportunities but increases the risk of death or childbirth injuries if they have babies before their bodies are ready.

""Child marriage starts a cycle of disadvantage that denies girls the most basic rights to learn, develop and be children,"" said Save the Children International CEO Helle Thorning-Schmidt. ""Girls who marry too early often can't attend school, and are more likely to face domestic violence, abuse and rape. They fall pregnant and are exposed to STIs including HIV.""

The report ranks countries from the best to the worst in which to be a girl, based on child marriage, schooling, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and number of female lawmakers.

Niger, Chad, Central African Republic, Mali and Somalia were ranked at the bottom of the index.

Researchers say conflict, poverty and humanitarian crises are major factors that leave girls exposed to underage marriage.

The shutting down of schools in the wake of the Ebola outbreak led to an estimated 14,000 teen pregnancies in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak, Save the Children said. The global charity gave the example of Sahar, who did not want to give her real name, a 14-year-old Syrian refugee in Lebanon. Married to a 20-year-old man, aged just 13, Sahar is now two months pregnant.

""The wedding day, I was imagining it would be a great day but it wasn't. It was all misery. It was full of sadness,"" Save the Children quoted Sahar as saying.

The draft of 'The Communicable Diseases Prevention, Control and Eradication Act' was prepared aimed at tackling emergency situation related to public health by checking and eradicating all contagious diseases. The approval was given at weekly Cabinet meeting held at the Secretariat with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair.

After the meeting, Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam told reporters that the draft law was prepared merging 'The Bangladesh Malaria Eradication Board (Repeal) Ordinance, 1977' and 'Prevention Of Malaria (Special Provisions) Ordinance, 1978'.

Another goal of the draft law is to protect people from communicable diseases and proper measures to create mass awareness about germs related diseases like Kala-Zar (fever), HIV Aids, Influenza, Nipah, Ebola, Anthrax, Avian Flu and Typhoid, he added.

He said as per earlier directives of the Supreme Court that had declared all martial law regimes ordinances illegal, the draft law was placed before the Cabinet by translating the original law into Bangla as well as widening the area of its jurisdiction to cover all the contagious diseases.

Under the proposed law, a patient or the affected person will have to be screened and isolated to protect common people from being affected, he said.

Shafiul Alam said the affected person will also have to be examined in the related and specified institutes to detect the type of disease.

Though the Health Ministry suggested the government to incorporate provisions of punishment for violation of the law, the Cabinet has not agreed. It asked the Ministry to re-examine the provisions before placing the final draft to the Cabinet after taking the Law Ministry vetting. As per the draft of 'The Cadet College Act', there will be a Central Governing Council headed by the Defence Secretary that will work as central committee of all the committees of the Cadet Colleges to oversee overall functioning of the colleges, the Cabinet Secretary said.

Besides, there will also be a College Governing Body headed by its Adjutant General to supervise the administrative activities of the cadet colleges.

The Central Governing Council can hold meeting once or twice a year while College Governing Body can frequently sit in meetings to discuss issues under its jurisdiction defined in the law.

He said, currently, there are 12 public cadet colleges in the country.","['nod', 'diseases', 'college', 'related', 'laws', 'law', 'draft', 'secretary', 'cabinet', 'act', 'cadet', 'governing']","Two draft laws get Cabinet nod Staff Correspondent Published :Tuesday, 10 May, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 12 The Cabinet on Monday approved two drafts of acts - 'The Communicable Diseases Prevention, Control and Eradication Act, 2016' and 'The Cadet College Act, 2016' -with a view to upgrade and to make the existing laws more time-befitting.

Youth declaration for SDGs,"Although remarkable progress and unprecedented levels of global attention and effort were seen in the last couple of years, the United Nations (UN) along with its member states and wider international community, was not able to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets since their introduction in 2000. As",,2015-09-18 00:00:00,"Youth declaration for SDGs Khalid Yahyea Published :Friday, 18 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 33 Although remarkable progress and unprecedented levels of global attention and effort were seen in the last couple of years, the United Nations (UN) along with its member states and wider international community, was not able to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets since their introduction in 2000. As a consequence, the UN announced setting a new agenda towards the end of 2015 substituting the MDGs with a post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework.

The eight MDGs along with other 21 targets and 60 indicators were set by the UN in 2000 to be achieved by 2015, taking 1990 as the base year to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability and develop global partnership for the development.

Although the MDGs were unquestionably well-intentioned, the needs and skills of youths as well as their empowerment were omitted in the framework, and thus the MDGs failed to recognize youths as strategic actors in the solution matrix. As the international community prepares itself for the launch of the Post 2015 goals, it is important that youth are included as equal partners in the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the framework.

A total of 75selected influential youth delegates representing 32 countries covering every part of the world gathered in Seoul and Goesan of Korea to discuss the role of the youths in contributing to the realization of the MDGs and the Post 2015 SDGs. The 26th International Youth Forum was hosted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, the Republic of Korea (MOGEF), and organized by the National Council of Youth Organizations in Korea (NCYOK) recently.

The main theme was Youth in MDGs and Post 2015 and sub-themes were Global Youth Perspective on Millennium Development Goal and Global Youth's Contributions for Sustainable Development Goals. The forum included keynote lectures, country case presentations, inter-group discussions, council debate, open forum, plenary session, Korean traditional culture experience, practical music lessons, outdoor activities, cultural night, certificates distribution and, finally, the youth declaration.

The conference put emphasis on making the youths more aware of global issues to tackle them and find alternative ways or solutions, improving cooperation and mutual understanding among youths across diverse cultures, spreading goodwill around the world and building interactive global citizenship through networking among youths.

Remembering the commitment of the UN and its member states to recognize the youth as an integral part in the development of the Post 2015 Agenda, youth should be highly considered a strategic capacity building partner that is allowed to assume responsibilities in political, economic, and social domains in their countries and communities.

Evaluation of the achievement of MDGs,"The General Economic Division of the Planning Commission has revealed that though Bangladesh's achievement in five Millennium Development Goal areas is remarkable in three other areas it may not achieve full success. In the areas where full success will not be achieved are eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement of universal primary education, gender equality and empowerment women. All",,2014-09-09 00:00:00,"The General Economic Division of the Planning Commission has revealed that though Bangladesh's achievement in five Millennium Development Goal areas is remarkable in three other areas it may not achieve full success. In the areas where full success will not be achieved are eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement of universal primary education, gender equality and empowerment women. All MDG goals set by the United Nations Organisation (UNO) were products of far-sighted thoughts of economic thinkers and development planners especially in the context of developing and under developed countries. The MDG time frame will expire in 2015; countries that were down to earth with the programme are now busy to assess their areas of success and the areas which still remain to be fulfilled.

Out of the eight MDGs Bangladesh's achievement in poverty alleviation, infant mortality, maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability and developing global partnership for development are note worthy. In other three areas namely eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education and achieving gender equality and empowerment of women shall not be fully achieved. Speaking realistically, the areas which shall remain unfulfilled are enormously important and all agencies of the government should have focused their attentions towards them. One positive thing is that the MDG time frame has another one year and a quarter and all out effort will definitely help reaching nearer to the achievement line. Now it is for all of the concerned agencies and individuals of the government to double the speed of their march forward.

Non-fulfilment in these three areas shall affect the country adversely especially in view of the national target of reaching a middle income level by 2021. Extreme poverty is painful and is a shame for any country and in none of the even moderately developed civilised countries there is a group of people who are so poor that they do not have food to eat, place to live and no medical support during ailment. In ultimate analysis it will come that extreme poverty is against human rights and it is inhuman as well. According to an UNDP and Bangladesh Central Bank joint statistics out of nearly nine crore eligible workers of Bangladesh three and a half crore are out of employment which is appalling and we, at all level, must be ever vigilant of that.

A portion of the unemployed people is extreme poor and hungry and hence it should be our utmost endeavour to wither these human miseries.","['areas', 'evaluation', 'countries', 'achievement', 'shall', 'poverty', 'success', 'mdg', 'development', 'women', 'mdgs', 'extreme']","In the areas where full success will not be achieved are eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement of universal primary education, gender equality and empowerment women.

Adolescent radio listeners' initiative launched,Bangladesh Betar and UNICEF Bangladesh jointly launched,,2014-11-26 00:00:00,"Betar, UNICEF Team Up Adolescent radio listeners' initiative launched Staff Correspondent Publish Date : 2014-11-26, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 10 Bangladesh Betar and UNICEF Bangladesh jointly launched ""Adolescent Radio Listeners Initiative"" on Tuesday to ensure access of adolescent girls and boys to information on 'facts for life' messages.

Speakers at the launching ceremony said that this project will create awareness among the adolescents about their rights and social norms congenial to their improved wellbeing.

The initiative will create opportunities for the adolescent boys and girls to access information and to actively participate in the process of knowledge management. It will help them in sharing on major issues related to their development, including child marriage, child labour, corporal punishment, adolescent nutrition, puberty, HIV AIDS, hand washing, improved sanitation, safe water and reproductive health.

Hasanul Haq Inu, Information Minister, inaugurated the initiative as Chief Guest. Nance Webber, Chief of Communication for Development Section, UNICEF Bangladesh, was the Special Guest at the launching ceremony.

Most of the 29 million adolescents aged between 10 to 19 years are not aware of the 'facts for life' and necessary information for their 'life skills'. Three of ten adolescent girls get married at the age between 15 and 17 years. Only 57 per cent females below 20 years usually get services from physicians or nurses during pregnancy, the speakers said citing a recent survey.

They also said that about 3.2 million children aged five to 17 are engaged in child labour. Among them 90 per cent are involved in informal and risky professions. Some 91 per cent school children have to bear physical torture in spite of ban on corporal punishment. At least 64 per cent of injury related deaths occur during 15-17 years of age. Everyday six adolescents take their own lives in Bangladesh. Under these circumstances, the country-wide Radio Listener's Clubs would help uphold the rights of adolescents and ensure a healthy life for them.

Adolescents aged between 14 and 19, irrespective of caste and creeds as well as socio-economic status are eligible to be member of Radio Listeners' Club named 'Koishorer Agrodut'. Children with disabilities, street children and marginalized group members are given preference to be the member of the club. Besides, members of various adolescent groups, school brigades, Interactive Popular Theatre (IPT) groups, madrasa students, and existing members of radio listeners club are eligible to be members of 'Koishorer Agrodut' Radio Listener's Club, speakers said.

Md Sohel Rana, Assistant Project Director, Bangladesh Betar, delivered the welcome speech at the launching ceremony.

In February, major general Ibrahim Abdulatty, had presented what he called a ""miraculous scientific invention"" to a high level audience. A device called C-Fast was described as being able to detect illnesses including AIDS and hepatitis C. A related dialysis unit called ""complete cure device"" was also unveiled.

But at a press conference on Saturday, a military representative said the devices required further testing, due to the limited sample size in its original trial.

No members of the team responsible for the devices were reachable for comment on Saturday, and Abdulatty was conspicuously absent from the event.

The World Bank needs to return to its mission,,,None,"With a clear plan, the World Bank would be able to find partners to help it support progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which has been disappointing so far. Instead, the Bank is adopting an approach that would leave poor countries mired in debt, by relying on Wall Street to finance their basic needs.



The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity. These goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. But the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy, and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington. The Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, should find a better way forward, and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes.

Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005, to scale up the world's response to the AIDS epidemic. Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard University's Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope.

I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits. I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism, a global fund, to fight AIDS, and a new funding effort by the United States.

In early 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program. The World Health Organization, led by the Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, recruited Kim to lead the WHO's scale-up effort. Kim did a fantastic job, and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions, saving lives, livelihoods, and families.

There are four lessons of that great success. First, the private sector was an important partner, by offering patent-protected drugs at production cost. Drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations. They recognized that patent rights, if exercised to excess, would be a death warrant for millions of poor people.

Second, the effort was supported by private philanthropy, led by Bill Gates, who inspired others to contribute as well. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation backed the new Global Fund, the WHO, and the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which I led for the WHO in 2000-2001 (and which successfully campaigned for increased donor funding to fight AIDS and other killer diseases).

Third, the funding to fight AIDS took the form of outright grants, not Wall Street loans. Fighting AIDS in poor countries was not viewed as a revenue-generating investment needing fancy financial engineering. It was regarded as a vital public good that required philanthropists and high-income countries to fund life-saving treatment for poor and dying people.

Fourth, trained public health specialists led the entire effort, with Kim and Farmer serving as models of professionalism and rectitude. The Global Fund does not stuff the pockets of corrupt ministers, or trade funding for oil concessions or arms deals. The Global Fund applies rigorous, technical standards of public health, and holds recipient countries accountable - including through transparency and co-financing requirements - for delivering services.

The World Bank needs to return to its mission. The SDGs call for, among other things, ending extreme poverty and hunger, instituting universal health coverage, and universal primary and upper secondary education by 2030. But, despite making only slow progress toward these goals, the Bank shows no alarm or strategy to help get the SDGs on track for 2030. On the contrary, rather than embrace the SDGs, the Bank is practically mute, and its officials have even been heard to mutter negatively about them in the corridors of power.

Perhaps US President Donald Trump doesn't want to hear about his government's responsibilities vis-vis the SDGs. But it is Kim's job to remind him and the US Congress of those obligations - and that it was a Republican president, George W. Bush who creatively and successfully pursued the battle against AIDS.

Wall Street may help to structure the financing of large-scale renewable energy projects, public transport, highways, and other infrastructure that can pay its way with tolls and user fees. A World Bank-Wall Street partnership could help to ensure that such projects are environmentally sound and fair to the affected communities. That would be all for the good.

Yet such projects, designed for profit or at least direct cost recovery, are not even remotely sufficient to end extreme poverty. Poor countries need grants, not loans, for basic needs like health and education. Kim should draw on his experience as the global health champion who successfully battled against AIDS, rather than embracing an approach that would only bury poor countries in debt. We need the World Bank's voice and strenuous efforts to mobilize grant financing for the SDGs.

Health care for the poor requires systematic training and deployment of community health workers, diagnostics, medicines, and information systems. Education for the poor requires trained teachers, safe and modern classrooms, and connectivity to other schools and to online curricula. These SDGs can be achieved, but only if there is a clear strategy, grant financing, and clear delivery mechanisms. The World Bank should develop the expertise to help donors and recipient governments make these programs work. Kim knows just how to do this, from his own experience.

Trump and other world leaders are personally accountable for the SDGs. They need to do vastly more. So, too, do the world's super-rich, whose degree of wealth is historically unprecedented. The super-rich have received round after round of tax cuts and special tax breaks, easy credits from central banks, and exceptional gains from technologies that are boosting profits while lowering unskilled workers' wages. Even with stock markets' recent softness, the world's 2000+ billionaires have around $10 trillion in wealth - enough to fund fully the incremental effort needed to end extreme poverty, if the governments also do their part.

When going to Wall Street, or Davos, or other centers of wealth, the World Bank should inspire the billionaires to put their surging wealth into personal philanthropy to support the SDGs. Bill Gates is doing this, with historic results, for public health. Which billionaires will champion the SDGs for education, renewable energy, fresh water and sanitation, and sustainable agriculture? With a clear SDG plan, the World Bank would find partners to help it fulfill its core, historic, and vital mission.

Illegal trade of human organ: Legal shortcomings,"There is a menacing illegal trade of kidneys going on in many parts of the country. The main reason behind this is that in almost all the big cities, towns and districts, private hospitals, nursing homes or clinics have harvested up, which are involved in illegal organ trade, especially kidney",,2016-03-17 00:00:00,"World Kidney Day observed Illegal trade of human organ: Legal shortcomings Muhib Hasan Published :Thursday, 17 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 24 There is a menacing illegal trade of kidneys going on in many parts of the country. The main reason behind this is that in almost all the big cities, towns and districts, private hospitals, nursing homes or clinics have harvested up, which are involved in illegal organ trade, especially kidney transplantation. In Bangladesh the availability of medical transplants is lower than the requirement. The first kidney transplantation was taken place in Bangladesh in 1982. We need about 50 thousand kidneys whereas only five or even thousand kidney is available to the ailing patients. Therefore the illegal trade flourishes and there is an unholy nexus among the administration, police, private nursing home owners and a Section of doctors. They also appoint agents, who go to the poor, uneducated people in villages or towns and explain them about the benefits of selling organs. These poor people are made to believe that there are two kidneys in a body and even if they bestow away one, they can very well survive.

Transplantation of Human Organs Act-1999 deals with human organs transplantation in Bangladesh. Section 3 of the Act authorize the transplantation of human organ, it says 'Any healthy and medically sound person can donate any of his human organs to his near relative ,if such transplantation does not impede his normal life. Except- Person under 18 years old, Person whose tissue is H.B.S.AG, anti H.C.V or H.I.V positive and person declared to be incompetent to donate by medical board under this Section'.

Section 9 prohibit Offering, advertising or any other commercial dealings of human organ while Section 10(1) imposes punishment for violation of its provision rigorous imprisonment not less than 3 years and not more than 7 years or with fine of 3 lakh taka or with both. And if the offender is medical practitioner with the above said punishment his registration shall also be cancelled,

There is bad repute existing about some laws of Bangladesh being quixotic enough, this very Act is one of them. There are many lacunas in this Act frustrating the main purpose of enacting the same. Legal loopholes rather lead to illegal trade of human organs. These are- firstly, the present law regulates transplantation of only human organs. It needs to include tissues also. Secondly, the definition of `near relative' is proposed to be expanded in order to include the grandparents and grandchildren as `near relative'. There was no provision for grandparents and grandchildren. Thirdly, the very preamble of the ACT speaks about collection and conservation of human organs, but the provisions of the Act remains totally struck dumb about these important terms, namely how to collect? Who will collect? Where to reserve? Is there any national conservation center? These questions remain permanently unanswered. Section 7 only speaks about formation of medical board but what procedure to be followed in doing the same and what is the exact function of those govt-appointed physician are not clearly mentioned here. Fourthly, no provision of registration of medical centre, or university or collage for the purpose of transplantation work is there, which is urgent! Besides registration of donor and recipient it needs to put provision for the registration of such college or university or medical centre as well. Fifthly, who will take cognizance of this offence is not mentioned in this Act it only says that the procedure of criminal procedure ACT 1898 (V of 1898) shall be applicable regarding any offence under this Act. But this is not sufficient, as it appears to be such a poignant issue it should specify the actual authority who can take cognizance of this offence and which court shall entertain the case. In India in its respective Act -1994, Section 22 specifies that only Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under this Act. Sixthly, Section 11 of TOHO Act-1999 empowers the government to prescribe rules, but yet no rules have been framed, which is very much indispensable for actual enforcement of this Act. Seventhly, it needs to prescribe an appropriate authority that will grant permission of transplantation and examine the donor and recipient and take cognizance of offence, Lack of all these important issues makes the TOHO Act-1999 crippled.

From both legal and ethical aspect commercial dealings of human organ is appalling. The victim of this bio -violence is poor Section of society, they remain always deprived. They are often trapped by a lucrative offer. They agree to donate (in real) to sell their organ, but when they are not paid, they cannot seek the assistant of law enforcers, as the total transaction and consideration were illegal, the was illegal, no contract was there. This is how this system prolonging the life of 'haves' over the life of 'haves nots'. They are illiterate, unaware Section of the society. They are misled, misunderstood, disconcerted. Poverty doffed away the clothes of general prudence from them leading them to such deadly transaction. One of the main culprits leading this unlucky Section of the society to such a dolorous life is TOHO Act-1999 itself. Before regulating transplantation of human organs, this law itself needs some legal -transplantation of important provisions first. Hopefully then we may stop this bio-violence.

Zika virus infection 'through sex' reported in US,"A rare case of the Zika virus being transmitted through sex, not a mosquito bite, has been reported in the US.A patient infected in Dallas, Texas, is likely to have been infected by sexual contact, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) told the BBC.The person had not travelled to infected",,2016-02-03 00:00:00,"Zika virus infection 'through sex' reported in US Observer Online Desk Published :Wednesday, 3 February, 2016, Time : 11:32 AM View Count : 33 A rare case of the Zika virus being transmitted through sex, not a mosquito bite, has been reported in the US.



A patient infected in Dallas, Texas, is likely to have been infected by sexual contact, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) told the BBC.



The person had not travelled to infected areas but their partner had returned from Venezuela.



Zika is carried by mosquitoes and has been linked to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains.



It is spreading through the Americas and the World Health Organization has declared the virus a global public health emergency.



The American Red Cross has meanwhile urged prospective blood donors returning from Zika-hit countries to wait at least 28 days before donating their blood.



The ""self-deferral"" should apply to people returning from Mexico, the Caribbean or Central or South America during the past four weeks, the Red Cross said in a statement.



In another development, two cases of the Zika virus have been confirmed in Australia. Officials said the two Sydney residents had recently returned from the Caribbean.



Meanwhile, Brazil - the country worst hit by the outbreak - has revealed it is investigating 3,670 suspected cases of microcephaly in babies linked to the Zika virus.



A total of 404 cases have so far been confirmed - up from 270 last week - while 709 cases have been discarded, the country's health ministry said.



If Zika can readily spread through sex, then it poses a risk to every country not just those with the Aedes mosquito.



So far, authorities have said sexual transmission is rare, but last year they would have said any case of Zika was rare, too.



This explosive outbreak has caught the world by surprise and many key questions remain unanswered.



Exactly how common or rare is sexual transmission? Can it be spread by the 80% of people who show no symptoms? How long does the virus persist in semen? When is it safe to have sex again?



What should men do after visiting affected countries? Can women also spread the virus through sex?



However, this is not a new HIV/Aids moment. HIV infection is incurable and dramatically shortens lives without daily medication.



Zika infections are short, mild and pose a significant threat only in pregnancy.



The ministry also said 76 infant deaths from microcephaly, either during pregnancy or just after birth, were suspected.



The case in Dallas would be the first known infection to take place in the mainland US, though Texas has seen seven other Zika cases all related to foreign travel.



Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director for CDC, said this was the first case it had dealt with involving a ""non-traveller"".



""We don't believe this was spread through mosquito bites, but we do believe it was spread through a sexual contact.""



A statement issued by the CDC said the best way to avoid Zika virus infection was ""to prevent mosquito bites AND to avoid exposure to semen from someone who has been exposed to Zika"".



The case is ""significant"" if it was definitely transmitted through sexual contact, Alaka Basu, a senior fellow for public health at the UN Foundation, told the BBC.



""This significance is parallel with the HIV/Aids case. It's worse in some ways, because there are two modes of transmission.""



It is not the first known case of sexual transmission. There was a case in 2013 in French Polynesia, according to the CDC website.



The CDC recommends that pregnant women avoid travel to more than two dozen countries with Zika outbreaks, mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America, including Venezuela.



Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said her government was focused on eradicating the mosquito that transmits the virus.



In an address to a joint session of Congress, she said considerable funds would be set aside for the programme.



""We should all be worried about microcephaly,"" she said.



The alert issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday puts Zika in the same category of concern as Ebola.



It means research and aid will be fast-tracked to tackle the infection.



WHO director general, Margaret Chan called Zika an ""extraordinary event"" that needed a co-ordinated response.



She said the priorities were to protect pregnant women and their babies from harm and to control the mosquitoes that are spreading the virus.



WHO has said it could take up to nine months for experts to prove or disprove any connection between the virus and babies born with microcephaly.

"Cooperation in traditional medicines, health care a win-win for Africa and India","The African leaders have made abundantly clear that for the development of the continent they are open for cooperation with any country that would result in a win-win situation for both. Development of the continent can be possible if there is a greater flow of investment, setting up of industries",,2015-11-05 00:00:00,"Cooperation in traditional medicines, health care a win-win for Africa and India ASHOK B SHARMA Published :Thursday, 5 November, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 73 The African leaders have made abundantly clear that for the development of the continent they are open for cooperation with any country that would result in a win-win situation for both. Development of the continent can be possible if there is a greater flow of investment, setting up of industries that would lead to creation of more jobs and skill development, value addition to products for consumption and exports, development of infrastructure, cooperation in energy, particularly in renewable energy, education and human resources development, access to markets for trade, development of blue or ocean economy, modernization of agriculture, food security and access to affordable and quality healthcare and services.

It is justifiable for a natural resource-rich continent that has been exploited by colonial powers over centuries, thereafter troubled by inter and intra-state conflicts and now by terrorism to look for partners who can ensure a win-win situation in the process. One significant area where India's engagement with the continent has been a success story is in the field of affordable and quality healthcare and services. The Agenda 2063 adopted by the African Union clearly lays down ""every citizen will have full access to affordable and quality healthcare."" The crux of 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3 adopted by the UNGA and the Africa Agenda 2063, therefore, is the same - to ensure good health and wellness for all citizens. At home, India has similar ongoing programmes to ensure public health.

India is the third largest supplier of pharmaceutical formulations and a major supplier of cheap and affordable generic drugs to Africa that has helped combat fatal diseases, like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. During the outbreak of devastating Ebola pandemic, New Delhi offered financial assistance that led to early detection of emerging dangerous pathogens like Ebola and Marburg viruses enabling more effective response. Two Indian scientists are among others in developing a vaccine to counter Ebola pandemic. While the recent Ebola pandemic surpassed all other outbreaks in terms of cases, deaths and geographic spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Lone, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continue to plague the diverse African continent. According to WHO, fatalities on account of NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and cancer are likely to increase by 27 per cent over the next 10 years. Most of the NCDs are due to lifestyle problems.

One major challenge before India is to resolve Africa's problem of public health and ensuring food and nutritional security. New Delhi's gift of Pan-African e-Network Project (PAENP) for tele-medicine and education covering 48 countries is unique in this respect. Through PAENP medical practitioners at the patient end locations in Africa can consult on-line with Indian medical specialists in various disciplines and specialties selected by the African Union for its member states. This network connects 53 remote hospitals, 53 learning centres, five regional universities and five regional hospitals throughout Africa. India has empanelled 12 super specialty hospitals and seven leading universities to provide expert domain knowledge in tele-medicine and tele-education. This project also helps African students to study medicine at seven universities in India. Continuing Medical Education (CME) classes are also conducted. India has installed diagnostic and pathology equipment in many African hospitals. Tele-medicine centres have been set up in four Regional Super Specialty Hospitals of Africa in Nigeria, Congo, Mauritius and Egypt.

Indian pharma companies have invested in Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. Some of the major Indian pharmaceutical joint ventures or subsidiaries for manufacturing or trading in Africa are Cipla, Ranbaxy, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, IPCA Laboratories, Parentearl Drugs, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Aubindo Pharma, JB Chemicals, Cadila Healthcare, Lupin and Intas Pharmaceuticals. Cipla has taken initiative in Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho and Zambia. Indian hospitals, like Apollo group, are offering consultancy services to hospitals in Ghana, Nigeria and other West African countries. Appasamy Associates of India in joint venture with Vision Care Centre of Zambia launched Vision Care Appasamy Eye Hospital in Lusaka. Indian Embassy hosted free eye care camp in Addis Ababa in December, last year. Many patients from Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan, Mauritius, Egypt and South Africa come to India on medical tourism for treatment in specialty hospitals and receive treatment from traditional systems of medicines.

India and Africa are enjoying cooperation in healthcare sector on win-win basis. It is time to strengthen it and extend the PAENP and healthcare system to include all African countries. PAENP should be extended to cover food and nutritional security and agriculture, particularly medicinal herbs cultivation and conservation. Africa is diverse with flora and fauna many of which have unique medicinal value. With a view to prevent bio-piracy and misappropriation of traditional knowledge, India has set up a Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). Africa should do the same and allow bio-prospecting on the basis of benefit sharing with local communities. India has enacted Biological Diversity Act 2002 and has set up National Biodiversity Authority and state biodiversity boards to protect traditional knowledge and its ownership by local communities. India has launched Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) that works on the principle of open access to knowledge, expertise and resources in drug discovery involving a network of students, scientists from academia, industry and clinicians worldwide. OSDD coupled with Contract Research and Manufacturing Services are the mechanism for making new drugs cheaper and affordable. New Drugs Price Control Order 2013 and the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority in India make many life-saving drugs cheap and affordable. Besides, India uses flexibility under TRIPS regime to produce generic drugs at low costs. Thus, India can be Africa's befitting partner in reducing its disease burden.

But the use of traditional system of medicines would not only be cost effective but also preventive. India should assist Africa in its Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) for food security and cultivation of nutritional crops including medicinal herbs. Africa has ample scope for exporting and consuming organic produces. The African Union in its 2015 Summit symbolically consigned the use of hand-held hoes to the museum, so as to replace them with tillers and other modern technology that can improve productivity. Intensification of pulses cultivation in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria and Ethiopia can help India in meeting its shortage in this commodity and help Africa earn in foreign exchange. Similar can be the case of onion cultivation in Egypt, Burkina Faso, Cape Verdes, Central African Republic, Cameroon and Burundi. Morocco, Tanzania, Togo, Senegal, Algeria, South Africa have reserves of phosphate rocks while Congo Brazzaville and Ethiopia have potash reserves. Both phosphate and potash fertilizers are need for Indian agriculture.

The Indian Prime Minister Narendrabhai Damodardass Modi at the recent Third India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi said ""we will also collaborate to develop Indian and African treasures of traditional knowledge and medicines."" Going by this assurance, one can hope that India-Africa cooperation in health sector would take a new dimension in making use of traditional systems of medicines that can not only be a preventive remedy but also cost effective. Use of traditional medicines can help in nutritional security. India's traditional systems of medicine like Ayurveda and Siddha can also gain by use of herbs found in Africa.

The African leaders have made abundantly clear that for the development of the continent they are open for cooperation with any country that would result in a win-win situation for both. Development of the continent can be possible if there is a greater flow of investment, setting up of industries that would lead to creation of more jobs and skill development, value addition to products for consumption and exports, development of infrastructure, cooperation in energy, particularly in renewable energy, education and human resources development, access to markets for trade, development of blue or ocean economy, modernization of agriculture, food security and access to affordable and quality healthcare and services.It is justifiable for a natural resource-rich continent that has been exploited by colonial powers over centuries, thereafter troubled by inter and intra-state conflicts and now by terrorism to look for partners who can ensure a win-win situation in the process. One significant area where India's engagement with the continent has been a success story is in the field of affordable and quality healthcare and services. The Agenda 2063 adopted by the African Union clearly lays down ""every citizen will have full access to affordable and quality healthcare."" The crux of 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3 adopted by the UNGA and the Africa Agenda 2063, therefore, is the same - to ensure good health and wellness for all citizens. At home, India has similar ongoing programmes to ensure public health.India is the third largest supplier of pharmaceutical formulations and a major supplier of cheap and affordable generic drugs to Africa that has helped combat fatal diseases, like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. During the outbreak of devastating Ebola pandemic, New Delhi offered financial assistance that led to early detection of emerging dangerous pathogens like Ebola and Marburg viruses enabling more effective response.

"Goodbye Banjul, India set to intensify relations with Africa",India's engagement with Africa is set to enter a new phase with the hosting of the 5-day summit meeting with the leaders of the continent. The first summit level talk was held in 2008 in New Delhi and the second one was in 2011 at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Though,,2015-10-21 00:00:00,"Goodbye Banjul, India set to intensify relations with Africa ASHOK B SHARMA Published :Wednesday, 21 October, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 72 India's engagement with Africa is set to enter a new phase with the hosting of the 5-day summit meeting with the leaders of the continent. The first summit level talk was held in 2008 in New Delhi and the second one was in 2011 at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Though the links between India and Africa are millennia old and New Delhi had supported continent's struggle for independence and fight against apartheid, China could score the point on having more intensive engagement with the continent. Comparatively India-structured institutional engagement with Africa as a whole had a late start. But better late than never. Prime Minister Narendrabhai Damodardas Modi has rightly seized the opportunity for deepening relationships with Africa picking up the thread from 2008.

What Prime Minister Modi intends is to give a new direction to India's institutional relationship with Africa. The earlier Banjul formula of inviting only 15 heads of state or government through the African Union has been done away with. Now all the 54 heads of state and government have been invited to the 5-day Third India-Africa Summit scheduled towards the end of this month in New Delhi and almost all the African leaders have given their consent for participation, making it the largest international summit meeting to be hosted by India after 1983 NAM and CHOGM summits. This led Prime Minister Modi to tweet ""Level of engagement for @indiafrica2015"" has been tremendously scaled up.

Turkey, Japan, European Union, China, South Korea and lately the United States have regular institutional arrangements with the natural resource-rich continent. Competition in engagement should not be a policy as in a multi-polar world there is enough space for every country to develop relationship suiting to its own convenience and to the needs of Africa. India, therefore, needs to develop its relationship with Africa in its own unique way. Since Banjul formula has been done away with, India needs to intensify its relationship with African countries through bilateral, regional and pan-African formats. There are several economic and political groups in the vast continent catering to regional interests and India needs to directly engage with these groups. At the same time we also need to maintain our relations with the African Union.

So far, India's development assistance was routed through the African Union. But the vast continent has countries with varied needs and priorities for development. Therefore it is necessary that India engage with these countries directly or through regional groups. Other venues of India's engagement are Economic Commission for Africa, Afro-Asian Rural Development Organisation (AARO), Pan-African Parliament, Indian Ocean Rim Association. Recently South Africa hosted the 5th BRICS Summit with focus on partnership for development, integration and industrialisation of Africa. BRICS countries agreed to set up a Development Bank to meet the needs of developing and least developed countries in which countries can be beneficiaries.

India's basic approach to development cooperation is a three-pronged strategy --- technical assistance, line of credit (LoC) and grants. Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) was launched as early as in 1964 to share its development experiences with fellow developing countries, but then the continent of Africa as a whole was not much in the focus. To give focus to the country's development cooperation programmes, a separate Development Partnership Administration (DPA) was set up in the External Affairs Ministry in January 2012. For promoting economic diplomacy Investment and Technology Promotion (ITP) Division was also created.

Since the First India-Africa Summit, India committed $7.4 billion Line of Credit (LoC), out of which $6.8 billion have been approved and $3.5 billion has been disbursed which created 137 projects in 41 countries. Total grant element in the LoC was $500 million. Though the pace of capacity building and training has been satisfactory, that of setting up of projects and institutions has been slow due to the delay in preparation of detailed project reports (DPRs) by African countries. India, with the help of AU, could set up Pan-African e-network for education and health in 48 countries. Since the first summit, New Delhi extended 40,000 scholarships for pursuing their study in India. Indian pharma companies supplied cheap medicines to contain HIV/AIDS in Africa, but its role in containing Ebola outbreak was limited.

It is an irony that while Africa seeks closer engagement with India New Delhi's response has not kept up to that pace. There are 43 African Missions in New Delhi while India has set up permanent missions in only about 25 countries.

There are some of the fastest growing economies in the world in Africa. It is a continent which has large amounts of arable land and rich in natural resources including oil and gas. It is a demographically young continent - 65 per cent of African population is under the age of 35. It has got a long coastline, very important in trade and strategic terms, of 26,000 km. There are, however, several landlocked countries.

Africa has adopted 2,063 Agenda for sustainable development, good governance, rule of law, democracy, gender equity, renewable energy, sustainable fisheries. The United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 with 17 goals and 169 targets. Will India be an active partner in Africa's development? Can India be a leader of the developing world, including the land locked countries and small island states in the global fora, particularly in the context upcoming G-20 summit, Paris conference on climate change and WTO Ministerial in Nairobi? Africa represents 28 per cent of UN membership and its support is crucial for India getting a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.

United Arab Emirates, Singapore, UN Coordinator for Africa, UN Global Head for HIV/AIDS and President of the African Development Bank are invited as special guests in the summit as they are interested in financing projects addressing health and social issues.

Apart from development of the continent, there are areas of win-win situation for both sides. Bilateral trade has reached $70 billion and needs to scale up further. Indian corporates' investment in the resource-rich continent is in the range of $30-35 billion. There is a 2.7 million Indian diaspora in Africa. There are ample scopes for setting up fertiliser plants in Africa with buyback arrangements. New Delhi depends upon import of pulses from countries like Tanzania to meet its shortages. Nigeria exports oil to India. Mozambique has huge gas potential and there are new hydrocarbon discoveries in North Africa including Somalia. About 400-strong business African delegation will be coming for the business forum meeting and trade ministers' meeting is likely to sort out problems in trade and investment.

Finally development can take place when there is peace and security. Africa is facing terrorist threats from Boko Haram and Al Shabab. India has joint working groups on counter-terrorism and defence training arrangements with several African countries which need to be extended to others. India is already in UN peacekeeping mission in Africa. Countries on the east coast of Africa are crucial for maritime security in the Indian Ocean and New Delhi has offered them a package of maritime security and sustainable blue economy. All wait for finalisation of the joint action plan with the African Union after the summit meeting which would pave the way for 2.3 billion people of India and Africa working together.

Risks of medical tourism,,,None,"Risks of medical tourism



Medical tourism most often is for surgeries (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism. People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including psychiatry, alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.



Medical tourism carries some risks that locally provided medical care either does not carry or carries to a much lesser degree. Some countries, such as South Africa, or Thailand have very different infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. hepatitis A, amoebic dysentery, paratyphoid) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to mosquito-transmitted diseases, influenza, and tuberculosis.



However, because in poor tropical nation's diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including HIV, TB, and typhoid, while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be ""rare"" in the West.



The quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. Also, travelling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights and decreased mobility associated with window seats can predispose one towards developing deep vein thrombosis and potentially a pulmonary embolism. Other vacation activities can be problematic as well - for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they are sunburned while healing.



Also, health facilities treating medical tourists may lack an adequate complaints policy to deal appropriately and fairly with complaints made by unsatisfied patients. Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognized by the World Health Organization, and in 2004 it launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety. This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services.



If there are complications, the patient may need to stay in the foreign country for longer than planned or if they have returned home, will not have easy access for follow up care. Patients sometimes travel to another country to obtain medical procedures that doctors in their home country refuse to perform because they believed that the risks of the procedure outweigh the benefits. Such patients may have difficulty getting insurance (whether public or private) to cover follow up medical costs should the feared complications indeed arise.



Receiving medical care abroad may subject medical tourists to unfamiliar legal issues. The limited nature of litigation in various countries is a reason for accessibility of care overseas. While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for medical malpractice, these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. Should problems arise, patients might not be covered by adequate personal insurance or might be unable to seek compensation via malpractice lawsuits. Hospitals and/or doctors in some countries may be unable to pay the financial damages awarded by a court to a patient who has sued them, owing to the hospital and/or the doctor not possessing appropriate insurance cover and/or medical indemnity.



Issues can also arise for patients who seek out services that are illegal in their home country.

Medical tourism refers to people travelling to a country other than their own to obtain medical treatment. In the past this usually referred to those who travelled from less-developed countries to major medical centres in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or illegal in the home country.Medical tourism most often is for surgeries (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism. People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including psychiatry, alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.Medical tourism carries some risks that locally provided medical care either does not carry or carries to a much lesser degree. Some countries, such as South Africa, or Thailand have very different infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. hepatitis A, amoebic dysentery, paratyphoid) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to mosquito-transmitted diseases, influenza, and tuberculosis.However, because in poor tropical nation's diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including HIV, TB, and typhoid, while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be ""rare"" in the West.The quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. Also, travelling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights and decreased mobility associated with window seats can predispose one towards developing deep vein thrombosis and potentially a pulmonary embolism. Other vacation activities can be problematic as well - for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they are sunburned while healing.Also, health facilities treating medical tourists may lack an adequate complaints policy to deal appropriately and fairly with complaints made by unsatisfied patients. Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognized by the World Health Organization, and in 2004 it launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety. This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services.If there are complications, the patient may need to stay in the foreign country for longer than planned or if they have returned home, will not have easy access for follow up care. Patients sometimes travel to another country to obtain medical procedures that doctors in their home country refuse to perform because they believed that the risks of the procedure outweigh the benefits. Such patients may have difficulty getting insurance (whether public or private) to cover follow up medical costs should the feared complications indeed arise.Receiving medical care abroad may subject medical tourists to unfamiliar legal issues. The limited nature of litigation in various countries is a reason for accessibility of care overseas. While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for medical malpractice, these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. Should problems arise, patients might not be covered by adequate personal insurance or might be unable to seek compensation via malpractice lawsuits. Hospitals and/or doctors in some countries may be unable to pay the financial damages awarded by a court to a patient who has sued them, owing to the hospital and/or the doctor not possessing appropriate insurance cover and/or medical indemnity.Issues can also arise for patients who seek out services that are illegal in their home country. In this case, some countries have the jurisdiction to prosecute their citizen once they have returned home, or in extreme cases extraterritorially arrest and prosecute. In Ireland, especially, in the 1980s-90s there were cases of young rape victims who were banned from travelling to Europe to get legal abortions.

PM for more WHO support to achieve health security,,,None,"MUNICH (Germany), Feb 15: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today laid importance on more engagement of the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure universal health services for all.

""As a global leader, the WHO needs to be engaged more effectively with nations to achieve the health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs),"" she said.

The prime minister was addressing a roundtable on 'Health in Crises - WHO Cares' at the 55th Edition of Munich Security Conference here.

The premier arrived here on Thursday in the first leg of her maiden overseas tour in two countries - Germany and the UAE - after assuming office for the fourth term last month.

Sheikh Hasina said her government has taken a plan to expand the universal health coverage manifold and make health services free for children under one year and elders over 65 years.

The prime minister called for an effective, results-oriented international coordination and cooperation for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal-3 and other health-related goals.

""Emergence of contagious diseases like Ebola, cholera and tuberculosis globally reveals that the existing health system needs to be upgraded and transformed,"" she said.

Sheikh Hasina also

underlined the importance of a predictable and urgent financing for the health security initiatives in the developing countries and LDCs.

""Often WHO had been caught wrong footed due to the enormity of the crisis, dearth of resources and its capacity. But, WHO, as our principal humanitarian organization, rightfully deserves high-level political support from governments to guarantee health and happiness for all,"" she said.

Sheikh Hasina said health service is one of the basic needs of human beings and so it requires our highest priority. ""It is unfortunate that we are failing to ensure appropriate health care for our people while right to health is the fundamental promise as described in SDG-3,"" she said.

The prime minister highlighted the steps taken by her government in health sector, saying consistent policies are being taken and financial support is being provided for the development of health security in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh has made a remarkable improvement in health sector side by side with socioeconomic development, she said, adding: ""Our efforts have made us a role model of 'good health at low cost'.""

Mentioning Bangladesh's success in the health sector, the prime minister said maternal mortality has reduced to 172 per 100,000 births, infant mortality to 24 per 1000 births and under-5 mortality to 31 per 1000 births.

Country's vaccination coverage is now 82.3% and life expectancy is more than 72.8 years, she said, adding that Bangladesh has made commendable success in elimination of tuberculosis and leprosy.

Sheikh Hasina said the MDR-TB shorter treatment regimen research was conducted in Bangladesh and famously known as ""Bangladesh Regimen"".

""The treatment regimen has significantly reduced the MDR-TB treatment duration from 20 months to 9 months with a better treatment success. The whole world is now moving towards shorter MDR-TB regimen,"" she added.

The prime minister said Bangladesh's success in the use of information and communication technology for health services is also recognized worldwide.

Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh in its development planning for last three decades has been giving utmost priority to make public health services available and accessible to all its citizens.

Under the plan, Health for All (HFA), Primary Health Care (PHC), Essential Service Package (ESP), etc were undertaken, she said.

The premier said more than 18,500 Community Clinics and Union Health and Family Welfare Centres at rural and community level are providing healthcare services to the grassroots people which include distribution of some 30 types of medicine free of cost.

Sheikh Hasina said her government is working for further expanding the medicine and health coverage through establishing new medical colleges across the country, at least one medical college in every district.

She said her government has already integrated the health- related SDG targets into the development programs. ""Our 'Vision 2021' and 'Vision 2041' have given top priority to ensure health security in Bangladesh,"" she added.

The prime minister said global health is multidimensional, spreading over boundaries and requires sustained high-level commitment and closer international cooperation.

""We need to work collectively as advanced technology and innovation have provided us with opportunities to work on health security particularly for the vulnerable sections of our society,"" she said.

Sheikh Hasina deeply appreciated WHO for being with Bangladesh in its difficult journey, especially in achieving the MDGs, reducing child and maternal mortality as well as supporting in various vaccination programmes and combating HIV, Malaria, Tuberculosis and other water borne diseases over the years.

She also commended the WHO's emergency activities for displaced Myanmar nationals in Bangladesh and other parts of the world including Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and Libya. -BSS","['prime', 'minister', 'security', 'services', 'hasina', 'treatment', 'success', 'support', 'development', 'bangladesh', 'achieve', 'health']","MUNICH (Germany), Feb 15: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today laid importance on more engagement of the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure universal health services for all.

An adolescent health perspective,,,None,"Recently a report from BBC circulated on social media about sex education on the school which sparked mass outrage and criticism from various social strata. Since the word ""sex"" is highly secluded due to cultural and religious orthodoxy, initiating sex education (generation breakthrough project) would be a matter of contention. But in the truest sense, this is neither against religion nor culture that may incite vulgarity or encourage illegal sex. The leading factor that leaves adolescent in vulnerable condition is their lack of information, understanding and access to service. What Islam says ""are they equal those who know and who don't know"" (Quran 39:9). Therefore, leaving children diffident about this cosmopolitan issue will make condition worse for them.



The adolescent is a period of transition involving multi-dimensional changes--biological, psychological, mental and social. At this juncture of life, adolescents experience profound change in all aspect of life. Biologically they experience pubertal change and change in brain structure, psychologically. Mentally, cognitive capacities become mature and they develop critical thinking skills and in social life they are expected to play multiple roles in the family, community and school.



Then, feeling of isolation and shame, their ignorance and unresolved curiosity about sex lead them to a world of conundrum. Gradually, they resort to various means whether it is valid or invalid and safe or unsafe for the gratification of intense feeling. Subsequently, a large chunk of them feel inferiority and suffer from grave mental trauma that results in inattentive to education, addiction and unstable growth. They become indecisive to make a way out of this predicament and remain in precarious condition perhaps rest of their life.



In this technology dominated era where adolescent spent a large amount of time on screen, they are frequently exposed to multiple unsafe and obscene stories. Although ICT minister blocked some pornographic site, internet and social media still contain numerous contents regarding nudity and pornography. Last year, ""BraveMen campaign"" a joint project by UNDP Bangladesh and centre for man and masculinity studies (CMMS) has revealed some astounding result about pornography addiction among school going children.



It was conducted among 900 students of three district which shows almost 61.65 per cent boy watch porn while 50.75 per cent search for similar content on the internet. On the other hand, 63.45 per cent acknowledged they watched porn first time on their mobile phone. This is disheartening for a productive and energetic generation we are dreaming for in future.



Bangladesh has 36 million adolescent which means one-fifth of the total population are between the age of 10-19 years (BBS, 2015). The government of Bangladesh introduced a national strategy for adolescent health 2017-2030 aligning with SDG to achieve better sexual and reproductive health by 2030. Commitment to take measure for adolescent health also reflected in convention on the rights of the children (CRC), international conference on education and development (ICPD), committee on the elimination of discrimination against women (CEDAW), national population policy 2010 and national health policy 2011 etc.



As many antidiuretic hormone (ADH) problems stem from sexual behaviour and sexual exposure, sex education can lessen the probability of any trouble. Their fundamental well-being and smooth growth greatly depend on sexual know how which is centre of this period.



Sex education includes information about anatomy and physiology, puberty, pregnancy, STI e g HIV/AIDS, along with the knowledge of defending sexual abuse and behaviour with the opposite sex. Its major concern is to assist adolescent to develop independence using skills such as communication, decision-making and negotiation. Thus, sex education is not approval to engage in sex but in case they encounter this situation, it teaches how to keep oneself safe and prevent any probable hazards. Adolescent is the culmination of one's life where they develop significant change both in biologically and psychologically and feel extreme desire for something unearthed to them.



In our country, parents are unwilling and stringent about teaching the sexual lesson to their children due to constraints posed by our entrenched social values. Moreover, they seriously lack knowledge and the basic perception of reproductive and sexual health matter. Research has shown that parental communication with the child, particularly between a mother and daughter will not only delay sexual intercourse and create negative attitude regarding pregnancy but also decreased the likelihood of the youth having unprotected sex and decrease the number of sexual partners. Providing girl with refusal skill training can help self-defence.



Dreams of a million girls and boys will remain unfulfilled until education in our school includes a comprehensive sex education. The lesson about sex in our curriculum is incomplete and partial that is inadequate to provide a minimum basic understanding of sex and related issues.



The truth is, the more frankly and voluntarily teacher, doctor and parents consults this issue with young people, the more likely the kids are both to delay in sexual activity and behave responsively and ethically when they do engage in it. We must be anxious about their safety and well-being instead of paltry shame. If we are unwilling to teach students about sex, we don't stop it but make it more dangerous. Sexual education focuses sexuality as a part of broader humanity.



Proper sex education is medically accurate, culturally appropriate and age appropriate. This will help adolescent successively overcome complexities they face during this stage of life. So, abstinence-only education can't be regarded as alternative education to ensure a safer life for the adolescent. Hence, implementation of sex education should be made mandatory task with the participation of concerned body and stakeholder.



In this highly uncertain world, we could not be unworried about our children and think they will handle themselves properly. It is unusual to expect someone be unscathed while surrounding constant threat of being harmed. We expect young children to be decent and courteous while this is not strange to embroil with any illicit act. There is plenty of harmful exposure in our society to which adolescent can be deviated easily. Only proper education can help them to overcome those challenging stages they face eventually in their life. We must break the cycle of shaming, negligence and indignation towards sex education for a stable growth of our potential future generation.

A genetic disorder is a condition that is caused by an abnormality in an individual's DNA. Abnormalities can be as small as a single-base mutation in just one gene, or they can involve the addition or subtraction of entire chromosomes. According to the Genetic Disease Foundation (GDF), there are more than 6,000 human genetic disorders. Most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions. In such cases, the defect will only be passed down if it occurs in the germline.



Gene editing, is also known as genome editing, is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism. Gene editing can modify genetic information within an organism's genome to create new characteristics, remove specific regions from genomes, such as those which confer disease susceptibility, add transgenes (genes from other organisms) to specific locations in genomes.



The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, a simple and ef?cient tool for genome editing, has experienced rapid progress in its technology and applicability of gene editing to a greater extent. It has created a miracle in the global healthcare industry. The invention of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools is one of the greatest scientific revolutions of this generation. As a result, this system has the potential to be employed to change each gene from all 23 pairs of human chromosomes without inducing undesired mutations.

In humans, each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, a total of 46. Twenty-two of these pairs, called autosomes, look the same in both males and females. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, differs between males and females. Chromosomes contain smaller units of genetic material called DNA inside the nucleus that spell out the genetic code. The DNA, a sequence of letters (A, T, C and G), is arranged like words and sentences called genes.A genetic disorder is a condition that is caused by an abnormality in an individual's DNA.

At 1.2kg (2.6lb), the baby was less than half the average weight of a normal Indian newborn and Ms Meena and her husband, Devilal, feared they would lose him.



Taking advice from a local doctor, they wrapped their days-old son in a thick blanket last November and took him by bus to a government-run hospital in the nearest city 130km (80 miles) away.



At the Maharana Bhopal General Hospital in Udaipur, doctors told the couple their child had a low survival rate.



The infant, with his underdeveloped immune system, had contracted sepsis - a bacterial infection which can be life-threatening - and was given antibiotics as treatment.



Doctors also told Ms Meena it was important the baby received mother's milk as it contained hormones and growth factors that would help him become stronger.

Surplus milk



The 22-year-old - malnourished and stressed - was not producing enough of her own. But thankfully, help was on hand.



The first human milk bank in north India, according to the NGO operating it, has been offering for free since April last year what health experts have long described as ""liquid gold"".



From its small, well-equipped clinic within the premises of the state-run hospital, the bank collects excess milk from mothers pre-screened for various diseases like HIV and hepatitis through a pump, which is then pooled, pasteurised and frozen ready to use for up to four months.



The bank's staff ask lactating women in the nearby area to give their surplus milk with the hope that they will persuade other mothers to donate.



Over 660 women - agreeing to come at least once a week - have donated their milk since the bank opened, feeding more than 450 babies mostly kept in the Udaipur hospital's neonatal intensive care unit like Ms Meena's son.



""He's recovering fast,"" said Ms Meena's husband six days after their infant first received donated milk through a tube. A month later, the family had returned home.



Despite major inroads in reducing child mortality - from 2.3 million deaths of children under the age of five in 2001 to 1.4 million in 2012 - India still accounts for 20% of infant mortality globally. Over half of these deaths are of babies under 28 days old, according to a Lancet report published in May.



Doctors say in India the main killers are infections and low birth weight that blight infants in their first month, and diarrhoea and pneumonia later on.



Superfood for newborns



To prevent these deaths, the charity Save the Children says breast milk, which it describes as superfood for newborns, is the most effective solution, particularly when a baby is breastfed immediately after birth and exclusively for the first six months. The World Health Organisation and Unicef agree - with both endorsing this advice.



The Rajasthan clinic, called the Divya Mother Milk Bank, is run by an Udaipur-based NGO which in 2005 opened Mahesh Ashram, an orphanage for abandoned children in the city.



Devendra Agrawal, a yoga guru who heads the NGO, noticed that the home's children, most of whom are girls in a country with a strong cultural preference for boys, suffered from low immunity. He realised it was because they were not receiving mother's milk.



Most, but not all, of the bank's milk is given to premature babies receiving care at the government-run hospital in Udaipur because of a limited supply.



""The first priority at the bank is to children at the hospital because they struggle with life and death. My children have immunity issues, but are not facing death,"" Mr Agrawal explains.



The clinic, set up at a relatively small investment of around 1m rupees (£9,900;$16,000), is among only around 11 in India, its chief operations officer, Dr RK Agarwal, estimates.



In the United Kingdom, where around 770,000 children are born each year compared to about 26 million births in India, there are 17.





A few months after its opening, another bank was inaugurated in Calcutta with the backing of the local government. Two in Rajasthan's largest city, Jaipur, are also expected to open by the end of this year.



Health experts have welcomed this, but say there needs to be a bigger push by the authorities on breast milk banking.



""It is difficult because they don't believe that it would be of great benefit,"" said Dr Armida Fernandez, who opened India's first milk bank at a hospital in Mumbai in 1989.



Training postmen



Arun Gupta, central coordinator of the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India, a Delhi-based non-profit, believes milk banking can help tackle child mortality as long as it is part of a larger strategy to promote breastfeeding like the one adopted in Brazil.



The South American nation today has more than 200 human milk banks - more than anywhere else in the world. As well as banks, Brazil's strategy also includes innovative measures like training postmen to provide information on breastfeeding to pregnant women and using fire-fighters to collect surplus milk for donation from lactating women.



This has contributed to the country achieving a 73% reduction in child deaths since 1990. Unicef says Brazil's under-5 mortality rate is now 14 deaths for every 1,000 children. In India, the figure is four times higher at 56.



""Brazil is a very successful model not only because there are milk banks in every major hospital, but that their policy also includes training staff for better counselling,"" Dr Gupta said.



""Promoting breastfeeding is labour intensive. India lacks well-trained counsellors to educate women. We need one for every 1,000 women. That's what I want to see.""



For Dr Agarwal, the dream is bigger.



""Perhaps it won't be possible in my lifetime,"" says the 70-year old, ""but I want human milk powder to be available in grocery stores.



""I want it to reach that stage in India. It's so economical. When animal milk powder is available why not human milk powder?""

Malaysia's leader has called the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in eastern Ukraine ""deeply shocking"".



Describing the disaster as a ""tragic day"" in a ""tragic year"" for Malaysia, Najib Razak said the investigation ""must not be hindered in any way"".

The plane, carrying 298 people, crashed in rebel-held territory near the Russian border.



Both sides in Ukraine's civil conflict have accused the other of shooting it down with a missile.



The Boeing 777, with the call sign MH17, was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.



It is the second disaster suffered by Malaysia Airlines this year. Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Malaysia to China in March and has still not been found.



In a statement, Malaysia Airlines said MH17 was carrying at least 154 Dutch nationals, 27 Australians, 43 Malaysians (including 15 crew), 12 Indonesians and nine Britons.



Other passengers came from Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada, with the nationalities of 41 people not yet confirmed.



Several of those on board - it is not yet clear how many - were heading for a major international conference on HIV/Aids in Melbourne, Australian officials said.



Other airlines have announced they are now setting flight paths to avoid eastern Ukraine, while Ukraine authorities have declared the area a no-fly zone, according to European flight safety body Eurocontrol.



Multiple reports from Washington cite unnamed US officials as saying they believe the plane, which had reportedly been flying at more than 30,000 feet (10,000m), must have been brought down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile.



The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on the disaster on Friday morning in New York.





'Swift justice'



In his statement, the Malaysian leader said the plane's route had been declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.



He said the plane had not made a distress call.



""Malaysia is unable to verify the cause of this tragedy. But we must - and we will - find out precisely what happened to this flight,"" Mr Najib said.



""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.""



Malaysia is sending a team to Ukraine to help with the investigation.



Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said it was an ""act of terrorism"".



Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told the BBC he had intercepted phone conversations that proved the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists.



But Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the Ukraine government for restarting military operations in the area, where it is trying to regain control from pro-Russian rebels.



""The country in whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for it,"" he said.



Separatist leader Alexander Borodai, meanwhile, accused the Ukrainian government of bringing down the airliner.



In a telephone conversation, US President Barack Obama and the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, ""agreed on the need to assure immediate access to the site... to international investigators... to carry out a thorough investigation"", the White House said.



A subsequent White House statement said it was ""critical that there be a full, credible and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible"".



World leaders demanded an international investigation



One US official said Washington strongly suspected a surface-to-air missile that downed the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday was fired by Ukrainian separatists backed by Moscow.



There was no evidence Ukrainian government forces fired a missile, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. US Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Detroit, said the passenger jet was apparently ""blown out of the sky"".



Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott appeared to go further than other Western leaders in apportioning blame, demanding on Friday that Moscow answer questions about the ""Russian-backed rebels"" that he said were behind the disaster.



More than 20 Australians were among the many nationalities aboard Flight MH17.



The Netherlands was the worst affected, with 154 Dutch citizens on the downed plane. The plane crashed near the village of Hrabove about 40 km (25 miles) from the border with Russia near the regional capital of Donetsk, an area that is a stronghold of rebels who have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for several months.



Ukraine accused pro-Moscow militants, aided by Russian military intelligence officers, of firing a long-range, Soviet-era SA-11 ground-to-air missile. Leaders of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic denied any involvement and said a Ukrainian air force jet had brought down the intercontinental flight.



Russian President Vladimir Putin - at loggerheads with the West over his policies toward Ukraine - pinned the blame on Kiev for renewing its offensive against rebels two weeks ago after a ceasefire failed to hold. The Kremlin leader called it a ""tragedy"" but did not say who brought the Boeing 777 down.



'Mistake or terrorism'



The plane fell between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk.



The head of the Russian Air Traffic Controllers' Union, Sergei Kovalyov, told BBC Russian that the airspace over eastern Ukraine had remained open during the conflict because the planes previously shot down had tended to be helicopters or low-flying fast jets.



""In order to bring down an airplane from an altitude of 10,000m, you need to have very serious weapons…. missiles,"" he said. ""It's either a mistake or a terrorist act.""



Game-changer in Ukraine crisis?



Ukraine has accused Russia's military of supplying advanced missiles to the rebels.



Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials blamed the Russian air force for shooting down one of its ground attack jets on Wednesday, and a transport plane on Monday.



In 2001, Ukraine admitted its military was probably responsible for shooting down a Russian airliner that crashed into the Black Sea, killing all 78 people on board.

But we must - and we will - find out precisely what happened to this flight,"" Mr Najib said.""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.""Malaysia is sending a team to Ukraine to help with the investigation.Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said it was an ""act of terrorism"".Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told the BBC he had intercepted phone conversations that proved the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists.But Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the Ukraine government for restarting military operations in the area, where it is trying to regain control from pro-Russian rebels.""The country in whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for it,"" he said.Separatist leader Alexander Borodai, meanwhile, accused the Ukrainian government of bringing down the airliner.In a telephone conversation, US President Barack Obama and the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, ""agreed on the need to assure immediate access to the site... to international investigators... to carry out a thorough investigation"", the White House said.A subsequent White House statement said it was ""critical that there be a full, credible and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible"".One US official said Washington strongly suspected a surface-to-air missile that downed the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday was fired by Ukrainian separatists backed by Moscow.There was no evidence Ukrainian government forces fired a missile, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. US Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Detroit, said the passenger jet was apparently ""blown out of the sky"".Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott appeared to go further than other Western leaders in apportioning blame, demanding on Friday that Moscow answer questions about the ""Russian-backed rebels"" that he said were behind the disaster.More than 20 Australians were among the many nationalities aboard Flight MH17.The Netherlands was the worst affected, with 154 Dutch citizens on the downed plane. The plane crashed near the village of Hrabove about 40 km (25 miles) from the border with Russia near the regional capital of Donetsk, an area that is a stronghold of rebels who have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for several months.Ukraine accused pro-Moscow militants, aided by Russian military intelligence officers, of firing a long-range, Soviet-era SA-11 ground-to-air missile. Leaders of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic denied any involvement and said a Ukrainian air force jet had brought down the intercontinental flight.Russian President Vladimir Putin - at loggerheads with the West over his policies toward Ukraine - pinned the blame on Kiev for renewing its offensive against rebels two weeks ago after a ceasefire failed to hold. The Kremlin leader called it a ""tragedy"" but did not say who brought the Boeing 777 down.The plane fell between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk.The head of the Russian Air Traffic Controllers' Union, Sergei Kovalyov, told BBC Russian that the airspace over eastern Ukraine had remained open during the conflict because the planes previously shot down had tended to be helicopters or low-flying fast jets.""In order to bring down an airplane from an altitude of 10,000m, you need to have very serious weapons…. missiles,"" he said. ""It's either a mistake or a terrorist act.""Ukraine has accused Russia's military of supplying advanced missiles to the rebels.Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials blamed the Russian air force for shooting down one of its ground attack jets on Wednesday, and a transport plane on Monday.In 2001, Ukraine admitted its military was probably responsible for shooting down a Russian airliner that crashed into the Black Sea, killing all 78 people on board.BBC,Reuters/QH","['ukrainian', 'flight', 'malaysian', 'crash', 'mh17', 'russian', 'international', 'deep', 'president', 'airlines', 'shock', 'leader', 'ukraine', 'plane', 'malaysia']","""Swift investigation needed"" Malaysian MH17: Deep shock over Ukraine plane crash Publish Date : 2014-07-18, Publish Time : 12:52, View Count : 117 World leaders demanded an international investigation into the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner over eastern Ukraine in which all 298 people on board were killed, a tragedy that could further heighten tensions between Russia and the West.

They mentioned that TB is no more a killer disease as early detection, proper and timely diagnosis and treatment and preventive measures are found effective in fighting the disease. So, there is no alternative to create social awareness in this regard.

There should be adequate measures of creating awareness among public to face the existing challenges of Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) tuberculosis as its consequences are very dangerous, they added.

National Anti-tuberculosis Association of Bangladesh (NATAB) organized the divisional meeting titled ""Role of Civic Society in identifying TB patients and control of the disease"" held at Chilies Party Point in Rajshahi city.

Civil Surgeon-in-Charge Dr Momtajul Karim addressed the discussion as the chief guest with NATAB local unit president Advocate Jamshed Ali in the chair. Medical Officer of Chest Disease Clinic Dr Ismat Ara and NATAB Consultant Dr Waliuddin Kibria narrated the risks and causes of TB infection and its preventive measures elaborately.

NATAB local unit general secretary Advocate Shahinul Haque Moon, District Manager of BRAC Kohitur Alam, Executive Director of Tilottoma Afzalur Rashid and Freedom Fighter Nur Hamim Rizvi also spoke.

Dr Momtajul Karim said TB is an infectious disease that usually spreads out through breathing of the affected patients. He underscored the need for conducting massive awareness and searching programmes to detect TB in slum and char areas of the district without further delay.

It is no more a deadly disease and it is fully cured if the affected patients take proper treatment, he said.

He, however, said the government is determined to achieve success in TB control through implementing the Directly Observed Treatment strategy and with enormous efforts of all the stakeholders GO and NGOs, TB diagnostic and treatment services now available throughout the country. Monitoring of the implementation status and achievements in TB control play a vital role in programme planning and advocacy and help in achieving the success in prevention and control of TB in a better way, said Dr Ismtat Ara.

She added that collective efforts of all the authorities and individuals concerned can reduce morbidity, mortality and transmission of tuberculosis along with making the nation free from the curse of the disease.

Dr Waliuddin Kibria termed the co-infection of TB and HIV as severe to any human body and laid stress on a comprehensive working force along with capacity development plan to deal with TB-HIV co-infection at different levels, layers and systems. ?Agencies","['awareness', 'waliuddin', 'measures', 'natab', 'treatment', 'disease', 'dr', 'tuberculosis', 'control', 'eradicating', 'patients', 'tb']","RAJSHAHI, June 7: Speakers at a view- sharing meeting on Saturday said creation of mass-awareness has become an urgent need for substantial reduction of tuberculosis.

India's progress in health outcomes during past two decades has been slower in comparison to other developing countries including Bangladesh with comparable incomes, a latest working paper prepared by Niti Aayog said, highlighting crucial gaps in India's healthcare system.

The paper, titled 'Health Systems in India: Bridging the Gap between Current Performance and Potential' , has drawn a comparison between India and other countries like China, Bangladesh, Nepal and Vietnam based on achievements under various health indicators during last 10-20 years. Niti Aayog (Policy Commission) is a policy think tank of the Indian government.

In most parameters, India languishes at the bottom of the table in comparison to the other countries, according to The Times of India.

Though the government's think tank has acknowledged the achievements in elimination of polio, population control and reduction of HIV prevalence, it has pointed out significant lapses in reduction of infant mortality (IMR), maternal mortality (MMR), deaths due to infectious diseases like tuberculosis, measles etc.

India's progress in reduction of IMR and MMR has also been significantly lower than that of countries like Cambodia, Nepal, Bangladesh and others, which are at a similar stage of development and have comparable incomes, the paper said.

For instance, pointing towards India's burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, it says, ""Despite impressive gains in per capita income, India's Human Development Index rank has stagnated since 2008, having risen by only 1 unit. In comparison to Nepal, which has risen by 4 units and Bangladesh which has risen by 2 units.""

Similarly, countries like China and Bangladesh have fared much better compared to India in dealing with infectious diseases like tuberculosis and measles.

In India, mortality due to tuberculosis has come down by 43.6 percent from 2000 to 2012, whereas in China deaths from the disease, during the same period, has dropped by 63.1 percent. In fact, India is also dealing with increasing problems of drug resistant tuberculosis.

India's progress in reduction of IMR and MMR has also been significantly lower than that of countries like Cambodia, Nepal, Bangladesh and others, which are at a similar stage of development and have comparable incomes, the paper said. ?UNB","['comparison', 'ahead', 'countries', 'india', 'risen', 'goals', 'tuberculosis', 'paper', 'nepal', 'bangladesh', 'bd', 'reduction', 'health']","BD, Nepal ahead of India in health goals Published : Saturday, 20 June, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 11India's progress in health outcomes during past two decades has been slower in comparison to other developing countries including Bangladesh with comparable incomes, a latest working paper prepared by Niti Aayog said, highlighting crucial gaps in India's healthcare system.

Published :Monday, 28 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 12 The World Health Organization (WHO) has welcomed the launch of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and committed to working with partners around the world to achieve the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Building on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SDG agenda demonstrates unprecedented scope and ambition, it said in a statement.

Poverty eradication, health, education, and food security and nutrition remain priorities, but the 17 SDGs also encompass a broad range of economic, social and environmental objectives, as well as the promise of more peaceful and inclusive societies.

SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages, profiles health as a desirable outcome in its own right. Importantly, however, health is also presented as an input to other goals, and a reliable measure of how well sustainable development is progressing in general.

The health goal itself includes new targets for key issues on which major progress has been made under the MDGs.

The global HIV, TB and malaria epidemics have been turned around. Worldwide, child mortality and maternal mortality have dropped greatly, by 53 percent and more than 40 percent respectively since 1990. ""But much remains to be done. Reports of global progress have often masked discrepancies in progress between and within countries. There is recognition of the need to focus not only on ensuring that people survive, but that they thrive as well,"" said the statement.

It has also become clear that the world would be a healthier place if there were global targets for a much wider range of issues. Importantly, the new goal includes targets for tackling non-communicable diseases. It also covers health security; reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health; infectious diseases and universal health coverage.

""WHO looks forward to collaborating with partners to meet all these targets, and particularly welcomes the inclusion of universal health coverage. Universal health coverage expresses the very spirit of the new development agenda, with its emphasis on equity and social inclusion that leaves no one behind,"" it said. ?UNB","['welcomes', 'work', 'world', 'sustainable', 'goals', 'global', 'sdgs', 'commits', 'development', 'partners', 'universal', 'targets', 'progress', 'launch', 'health']","WHO welcomes SDGs launch, commits to work with partners ?Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages?

Illness costs Africa hundreds of millions every year: WHO,,,None,"Illness costs Africa hundreds of millions every year: WHO



The World Health Organization has estimated that disease strips hundreds of millions of dollars from Africa’s economic output, as the burden of untreated disease hugely outweighs the potential expense of healthcare.







In a report published at the end of a three-day UN forum for universal health coverage in Africa, the WHO estimated that the 47 countries in its Africa region lost approximately 630 million healthy working hours in 2015 due to disease, AFP reports.





“A Heavy Burden: The Productivity Cost of Illness in Africa”, released Thursday, the WHO quantified that loss of productivity in economic terms.





It estimates that, if nations fail to adequately invest in healthcare and sanitation, annual loss of gross domestic product (GDP) could equate to 2.4 trillion international dollars — a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power parity as the US dollar.





“This is a huge cost to the Region and, indeed, for Africa as a whole,” said WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti in the report.





“Implementing the recommended essential health services to address the main causes of morbidity and premature mortality in the region would almost halve this cost.”





Countries south of the Sahara account for roughly half of the five million children around the world who each year die before their fifth birthday, while 40 percent of people with the AIDS virus in Africa still do not have access to HIV drugs.





The WHO said the majority — 59 percent — of illnesses to cause the loss of healthy working hours were communicable diseases, maternal and nutritional conditions, with around 30 percent due to non-communicable diseases and some 10 percent down to injuries.





Five countries — Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania — accounted for almost half of the work hours lost to poor health.





The WHO made a case for the region to “invest adequately in the development of resilient national and local health systems”.





It estimated that more than a third of the total cost of illness could be saved in 2030 if nations meet their health-related development goals.





Development specialists say out-of-pocket expenditure for health is a major source of impoverishment in Africa.





Universal health coverage is poor or absent across Africa, experts say, a view supported by a lack of statistics about the issue.





In 2001, African Union countries pledged to allot at least 15 percent of their annual budget to health. The WHO said very few — only four in 2015 —have achieved this goal.

“This is a huge cost to the Region and, indeed, for Africa as a whole,” said WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti in the report.
It estimated that more than a third of the total cost of illness could be saved in 2030 if nations meet their health-related development goals.
Universal health coverage is poor or absent across Africa, experts say, a view supported by a lack of statistics about the issue."
Storing breast milk,,,None,"Storing breast milk

Second scenario: Rimi (pseudonym) has delivered a preterm low birth weight baby with cleft lip 2 days back. Initially she was admitted at obstetric ward due to her serious illness, while the baby was admitted at neonatal ward. The neonatologist advocated breast milk to be given to the baby through a feeding tube, at a certain amount, and at a fixed interval.

In both cases, the mother felt the necessity to express breast milk and store it for their babies. In some conditions like preterm, low birth weight, unable to suck, sick babies, expressed breast milk may be needed. When mother is sick, has disease in breast, or works outside home for a longer period, she can store her expressed milk.

1. She can sit quietly alone or with other mothers, who can motivate her.

2. A baby on mother's lap or even photograph could be a good spur.

3. A warm bath or breast massage is beneficial.

4. Gentle rubbing to the nipple is often helpful.

After taking proper preparation the mother is ready to express milk. So, the next steps should be followed carefully.

1. Wash the hands with soap and clean water.

2. Select a washed, boiled, wide mouthed cup or container.

3. Use thumb one side and other fingers another side to make a 'C' pattern around the nipple. Now gently squeeze the breast from periphery toward centre. Avoid hard pressing and pulling the nipple.

4. Collect the milk and feed baby with the help of spoon, cup, tube etc.

5. If you want to store milk in several containers then label them accordingly. First collected milk should be fed earlier.

Now the most important thing, how long I can store milk, shall be discussed.

1. Store in room temperature: 25-370C for up to 4 hours, 15-250C for up to 8 hours, Below 150C for up to 24 hours

2. Store in refrigerator (2-4oC): up to 8 days.

3. Deep freeze: up to 3 months.

It is to be noted that don't boil milk directly after freezing, rather use boil water to heat the container. Using a bottle is always prohibited. You should consult with a pediatrician for further practical help and to determine amount of feed.

In some countries, even in our neighbor country India, the concept of 'Human Milk Bank' is being increasingly practiced. It allows a baby having no biological mother or mother with HIV infection to drink breast milk exclusively at least for first six months of life. Whatever the circumstances, we should remember and believe that nothing is better or a substitute to breast milk to a newborn baby. Each and every baby must drink only breast milk and not even a drop of water for first six months.

First scenario: Samia (pseudonym) is a garments worker. She went outside with her four months old sick baby. The baby got dehydrated due to diarrhea. The doctor detected formula feed as the culprit. The mother admitted that she was not very eager to feed formula, but duty period was a huge barrier.Second scenario: Rimi (pseudonym) has delivered a preterm low birth weight baby with cleft lip 2 days back.

When mother is sick, has disease in breast, or works outside home for a longer period, she can store her expressed milk.A mother should prepare herself before expressing the milk.

Girl children: Victims of malnutrition,,,None,"Girl children: Victims of malnutrition

Malnourished children face a daunting future with reduced intellectual capacity, frequent and higher risk of diseases. Malnutrition is responsible for making millions of children sick with life-threatening diseases; and unfortunately, three million children die every year just because we are not feeding them enough nutritious food, though the world has the capacity.

So, it is our fault, and we are guilty to our children to keep them hungry and malnourished. Also we feel unnecessary and illogical shame to teach our children about sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). Girl children are the worst victims of malnutrition and deprivation of SRHR. Gender, food security, nutrition and SRHR issues are interlinked. Nutritional deficiencies result in negative reproductive health outcomes.

If economic growth is presumed to get more children nutritious food, a booming economy alone does not make any change or difference of the problems of malnutrition and SRHR.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, rates of malnutrition in Bangladesh are among the highest in the world. More than 54 per cent of preschool-age children, equivalent to more than 9.5 million children are stunted, 56 per cent are underweight and more than 17 per cent are wasted.

Although all administrative divisions were affected by child malnutrition, but there were important differences in the prevalence of the three anthropometric indicators. The prevalence of underweight ranged from 49.8 per cent in Khulna to 64 per cent in Sylhet, which also showed the highest prevalence of stunting 61.4 per cent and wasting 20.9 per cent.

Bangladeshi children also suffer from high rates of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin A, iron, iodine and zinc deficiency. Experts suggested to incorporate components for school-age children, and adolescents who will also benefit from improvements in nutrition.

Improving nutrition can have a significant impact on survival as well as physical and cognitive development and productivity. Good nutrition, comprising adequate quality and quantity of food intake and reduction of illness is also a basic human right and is an essential input for economic development.

There is a clear need to diversify food sources both in terms of land/environmental sustainability, development of the rural economy and increased consumption to achieve improvements in the nutritional status of the people of Bangladesh, FAO recommended.

On the other hand, most of the children in Bangladesh do not have access to adequate information about their sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). A strong social and cultural taboo around the issue causes a pervasive silence behind it. As a result, most adolescents enter into marriage and pregnancy without any adequate preparation.

The current national school curriculum contains only minimum information about SRHR and often teachers are reluctant to teach the lessons. Research shows that Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. More than half of women marry before the age of 15 and nearly two in five girls aged 15 -17 are married. 57 per cent of these adolescents become mothers before the age of 19.

Children and adolescents appear to be poorly informed with regard to their own sexuality, physical well-being, health, and bodies. Whatever knowledge they have, moreover, is incomplete and confused. Low rates of educational attainment, limited sex education, and inhibited attitudes toward sex, contribute to this ignorance.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the crucial role of SRHR in ensuring the health and well-being of populations and in the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Worldwide, girls, younger than 18, are up to five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their twenties. Improved sexual and reproductive health is a key pillar of the overall health, empowerment, and human rights of individuals and of the sustainable and equitable development of societies.

Ill-health from causes related to sexual and reproductive health including too many, too early and too frequent pregnancies, remains a major cause of death and disability among women and girls. It is particularly among the most vulnerable, marginalized and underserved.

Poor sexual and reproductive health contributes significantly to poverty, thereby limiting socio-economic development. Conversely, achieving sexual and reproductive health empowers individuals and communities to participate in economic development, WHO mentioned.

Nutrition and reproductive health experts observed that poverty, hunger, malnutrition, gender inequality, human rights, health, and SRHR issues are closely-related. So, considering the life-saving initiatives for the millions of children worldwide, we must ensure nutrition and food security, universal access to comprehensive, affordable, quality, child and gender-sensitive SRHR information with easy and local languages.

Health services that need to provide to the girl children and adolescents include contraception, safe abortion, services to ensure maternal health and nutrition, promotion of indigenous local food in supplementary feeding programs with community participation, diagnostic and treatment services for STIs, HIV, infertility and reproductive cancers, counselling, and comprehensive sexuality education (CSE).

Moreover, CSE must be non-discriminatory, rights based, evidence-based, child-friendly and age-appropriate, which addresses physical, mental, emotional and social dimensions of human sexuality.

In terms of global health, it is defined as: 'Those health issues that transcend national boundaries and governments and call for actions on the global forces that determine the health of people'.

As the G20 meeting agenda that was held in Hamburg, Germany on July 7-8, 2017 links health to interconnectedness, it follows an understanding of global health that is broader than development cooperation. So, now, this is the right time to put child health, nutrition, and SRHR issues high on the national and global health agenda.

Let us come forward, feed the children with adequate nutritious food properly, and break the pervasive silence of sexual and reproductive health issues. We need to ensure the rights to know to save the valuable lives of our beloved children, the future assets of the world. The governments of all the states and the world leaders must think globally, act locally considering the health of the entire planet and to take action in their own communities and cities.

Rotavirus: A threat to your child's well-being,,,None,"Rotavirus: A threat to your child's well-being

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for everyone, when it comes to the health issues. Change of season sees a lot of people getting sick. Fever, cough, running nose, etc let their presence known.

One of the diseases that rears its ugly head during this season is diarrhea. During this period of the year, children who are under the age of five suffer most from this dreadful condition. Diarrhea is a disease that causes an individual to pass loose or watery stools, three times or more in 24 hours.

It's shocking that even in this era, diarrhea is still the second leading cause of death among children who are under 5. Statistics will tell you that about 9 per cent of all deaths in that age group is due to this easily treatable disease.

Causative organism:

Diarrhea is caused by a plethora of organisms -- virus, bacteria, protozoan - you name it! However, it is most commonly caused by Rotavirus, especially among children.

Seasonality:

Rotavirus can cause diarrhea during any time of the year. In Bangladesh, Rotaviral diarrhea is most common during winter and spring.

People at risk:

Anyone can come down with Rotaviral diarrhea. However, children are more at risk than adults. Also, people with compromised immunity (Such as those who are suffering from HIV) are more prone to an attack of Rotavirus than others.

Repeated infections with Rotavirus are prevalent. However, the severity lessens with each episode.

Dr Fuad Al Fidah MBBS (SBMC), MPH (BSMMU) Medical Officer ICDDR,B

Rotavirus may take up to 10 days to present itself after entering into the body. If a child has the virus in his or her system, and he or she can spread the disease to other children and even adults.

Signs and symptoms:

The main feature of Rotaviral diarrhea is vomiting and watery diarrhea which lasts for 3 to 8 days. Other relatively common symptoms are fever and abdominal pain. Other symptoms include:

* Loss of appetite

* Moderate to severe dehydration

* Decreased urination

* Crying with few or no tears

* Unusual irritability

* Abnormal sleepiness

Symptoms are more or less the same in the case of adults. However, they are much less severe.

Treatment:

Rotaviral diarrhea goes away after a few days. This is a disease that does not require antibiotic or other expensive treatment modality to recover from. What we need to ensure is that the child or the adult is getting enough oral saline (ORS) to prevent dehydration.

* For children over 10 and adults: As much ORS as they want.

* For children below 5: To determine the required amount of ORS, we would need to weigh the child. If a child's weight is 10kilograms and he is suffering from Rotaviral diarrhea, all you need to do is to give him 10 teaspoonfuls of ORS (1teaspoon holds 5 ml of ORS, 1 teaspoon of ORS for each kilogram).

* In severe cases, the patient may require admission to the hospital and intravenous fluid. However, if he is given an adequate amount of ORS, the risk of the disease get severe lessens significantly.

When to consult a doctor:

If your child-

* is suffering from diarrhea for more than a day

* vomits everything or frequently

* passes black or tarry stool

* becomes irritable or unusually sleepy

* has a fever (his temperature is 104 F or more)

Then you should consider consulting a physician.

Complications:

Rotaviral diarrhea may become severe enough to cause death! Another complication that is associated with Rotaviral diarrhea, but not caused by it is Hypernatremia.

Hypernatremia is a condition of the body where the concentration of sodium in the body becomes more than usual. It is caused by drinking excessive ORS or consuming ORS that was wrongfully prepared. Each ORS packet comes with explicit instruction regarding its preparation. By following those instructions and by giving the proper amount of ORS to a child, this severe and life-threatening condition can be averted.

Prevention:

Prevention is always better than cure, and it is very easy to prevent the spread of Rotavirus. The virus spreads through the fecal-oral route. By merely washing hand with soap after using the toilet, cleaning your baby and helping your child after he uses the toilet, you can markedly reduce the chance of a rotaviral infection.

Immunisation:

Currently, there are two types of vaccination available to immunise your child against Rotavirus. They are:

1. RotaTeq: This is an oral vaccine which has three doses. Usually, the first dose is given at 2nd month, and then the latter two is administered at two months interval. Although it is reported that a few of the children receiving RotaTeq has developed intussusception, a life-threatening disease, CDC (USA) did not find any relation between the vaccine and intussusception.

2. Rotarix: Rotarix is also an oral vaccine with only two doses. This one is usually given at ages 2 months and 4 months. Clinical trials have shown no increased risk of intussusception for those who take this vaccine.

Based on the recommendations from different ministries, Bangladesh Clinical Psychologist Society and Bangladesh Psychological Association, finalization of the draft has now become uncertain.

The psychologists are concerned with counselling without use of drugs but the psychiatrists are interested in use of drugs first and the final policy would mention the recruitment of psychologists or psychiatrists across the country.

Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) has been drafting the policy over the nine years with an aim to improving quality of life, developing mental and social state and sharpening skills in line with the framework of Bangladesh Constitution, preventing student dropout rate, boosting creativity, teaching in exciting environment and to ensuring good relations between students and teachers etc.

The draft policy also included improving proper working environment by delivering regular training to the officials to improve communication skill, to mainstream the disabled people, to raise professionals' responsibility and to strengthen the professional network, to get people affected by natural or manmade disasters back in normal life and to take initiatives to raise mass awareness on psycho- social counselling etc.

The draft was expected to be finalized by March 1 but due to some loopholes, a technical committee has been formed with renowned professionals, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) Secretary, Nasima Begum ndc said. The committee has no timeframe, it is learnt.

""The Ministry is very helpful in framing the policy, the stakeholders should help to make it easy as it has already taken years to prepare the draft"", said Professor Dr. ASM Atiqur Rahman of Social Welfare Department, Dhaka University.

Country's 16.2 per cent of total population has been suffering from different types of mental problems, a national study conducted by National Mental Health Institute and World Health Organisation in 2006 said.

And 4.6 per cent have been suffering from depression which is the main reason behind suicides.

Among other reasons, arrested development in childhood, malnutrition, lack of proper care, illiteracy, lack of self-control, poverty, increased mental pressure, mental and sexual harassment, problems in family and social life, pressure of dowry and extra-marital affairs are some of the factors behind mental and physical problems, the study said.

The mental problems play major role in raising non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, heart ailment and migraine etc.

Counselling plays the main role in improving metal and psycho-social problems and the policy seeks to reach government and non-government counselling service to the people's door.

According to the National Psycho-Social Counselling Policy (draft) 2016, psychiatrist, clinical psychiatrists, counselling psychiatrists, social workers, clinical social workers will provide counselling to people.

They will provide psycho-social counselling in families for mental development in childhood, teen age and for old stage. Street children, disabled people, educational institutes, offices, and social welfare institutes including hospitals, clinics, diagnostic and palliative care centres, religious institutions, day care centres, child development institutes etc. are to come under its ambit.

It is stated in the article 26 of the 1948 universal declaration of Human Rights that 'everyone has the right to education.' Education is not only a right but a passport to human development. It opens doors and expands opportunities and freedoms. It contributes to fostering peace, democracy and economic growth as well as improving health and reducing poverty. The ultimate aim of 'Education for All' means a sustainable development. Bangladesh has a constitutional obligation to ensure education for all. Global Monitoring Report 2012 reveals that about 200 million young people in the developing countries including Bangladesh have not even completed primary education, and have a lack any skill for work. This huge figure is gloomy, and has been both a surprise and a shock. Gloomier is the fact that all the EFA goals are off track, some even by a large margin. In this age of advanced technology that has made distant learning or e-learning a reality how could such a huge number of people remain devoid of basic skills how to read and write is really frustrating. The privileged people are reaping the benefits of advancement of science and technology and enjoying the positive things life offers. However, the EFA Global Monitoring Report points to a very important thing, besides revealing the figure of illiterate young people they urgently need a second chance to learn basic skills so that they can put food on the table and money in their pockets.

Education for All (EFA) is an international initiative first launched in Jomtien, Thailand, in 1990 to bring the benefits of education to ""every citizen in every society."" In order to realize this aim, a broad coalition of national governments, civil society groups, and development agencies such as UNESCO and the World Bank committed to achieving six specific education goals such as (i) Expand and improve comprehensive early childhood care and education, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children. (ii) Ensure that by 2015 all children, particularly girls, those in difficult circumstances, and those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to and complete, free, and compulsory primary education of good quality. (iii) Ensure that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programs. (iv)Achieve a 50% improvement in adult literacy by 2015, especially for women, and equitable access to basic and continuing education for all adults. (v) Eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and achieve gender equality in education by 2015, with a focus on ensuring girls' full and equal access to and achievement in basic education of good quality. (vi) Improve all aspects of the quality of education and ensure the excellence of all so that recognized and measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all, especially in literacy, numeracy and essential life skills.

After a decade of slow progress, the international community reaffirmed its commitment to EFA in Dakar, Senegal, in April 2000 and again in September of that year. At the latter meeting, 189 countries and their partners adopted the two EFA goals that are also Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Achieving the Education for All goals is critical for attaining all 8 MDGs-in part due to the direct impact of education on child and reproductive health, as well as the fact that EFA has created a body of experience in multi-partner collaboration toward the 2015 targets. Simultaneously, achieving the other MDGs, such as improved health, access to clean drinking water, decreased poverty, and environmental sustainability, are critical to achieving the education MDGs. Although there has been steady progress towards achieving many EFA goals, still challenges exist. Today, there are about 77 million children of school age, including 44 million girls, who are still not in school due to financial, social, or physical challenges, including high fertility rates, HIV/AIDS, and conflict. Access to schooling in developing countries has improved since 1990-some 47 out of 163 countries have achieved universal primary education (MDG 2) and an additional twenty countries are estimated to be ""on track"" to achieve this goal by 2015. However, huge challenges remain in 44 countries, 23 of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa. These countries are unlikely to achieve universal primary education by 2015 unless domestic and international efforts are accelerated substantially.

Bangladeshi constitution guarantees free and compulsory education as per Article 17. It says that the state shall adopt effective measures for (a) establishing a uniform mass oriented and universal system of education and extending free and compulsory education to all children to such stage as may be determined by law. (b) relating education to the needs of the society and producing properly trained and motivated citizens to serve these needs, (c) removing literacy within such time as may be determined by law.

Although the gender gap in education (MDG 3) is narrowing, girls are still at a disadvantaged position when it comes to access and completion of both primary and secondary school. Despite recent gains in girls' enrollment at both the primary and secondary levels-particularly in low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia-24 countries are unlikely to achieve gender parity at either the primary or at secondary level by 2105. The majority of these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poor learning outcomes and low-quality education also remains overriding concerns in the education sector. For example, in many developing countries, less than 60 percent of primary school pupils who enroll in first grade reach the last grade of schooling. Additionally, student /teacher ratios in many countries exceed 40:1 and many primary teachers lack adequate qualifications. The EFA goals and MDGs are complementary: as Irina Bokova, UNESCO's Director-General, says: ""When you fund education, you are securing progress towards all the Millennium Development Goals"".

Hundreds of women and girls accessed medical treatment in 2015 after experiencing sexual and gender-based violence at Kamrangirchar in Dhaka.

New patient data collected by the international medical organisation Médecins Sans Fronti?res/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) shows clinics run by MSF in the areas of Alinagar, Thoda and Jawlahati in Kamrangichar gave treatment to almost double the victims in 2015 ( 1,154 patients ) than it did in 2014 (684 patients ). The patients include those who have experienced rape, intimate partner violence, sexual violence and domestic violence.

""As soon as we opened these decentralised clinics, combined with raising awareness locally, we saw a large number of women and girls who needed medical care,"" said Emilie Gassier, MSF's project coordinator in Kamrangirchar.

""Usually women come to get help when their husbands and relatives are at work. Often they cannot afford the cost or the time to go to other areas of Dhaka. So it is important to have clinics near their home and easily accessible - allowing victims to come without having to explain themselves to anybody,"" Emilie Gassier said. MSF collaborates with the One Stop Crisis Center (OCC) run by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs in the Dhaka Medical College Hospital for severe cases that require referral services.

In 2015, more than 700 of the women treated by MSF had experienced intimate partner violence. While women and girls of all ages come to the clinic, most patients are aged between 15 and 30, said Dr Moury, one of the medics running the women's clinics in Kamrangirchar. ""The younger girls really struggle to open up about any sexual or physical violence they might have experienced,"" says Dr Moury.

""The main issues are the stigma and their sense that they have no alternative - that even though their husband is assaulting them, they have to stay with him. Some see it as their fate. We see that women are often too scared to seek help, but as awareness grows that these services are here and accessible to them, more and more women are seeking treatment,"" she said. MSF's clinics for women focus on treating the medical consequences of sexual and gender-based violence, for example, those who have experienced rape may have serious injuries resulting from the attack, as well as increased risk of sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea, as well as hepatitis B and HIV.

Sexual violence is also associated with a high prevalence of symptoms related to post- traumatic stress (e.g. avoidance, flashbacks and nightmares) and with other mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety.","['clinics', 'patients', 'kamrangirchar', 'msf', 'girls', 'treatment', 'violence', 'double', 'women', 'medical', 'sexual', 'experienced']","Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Kamrangirchar patients double Saifunnahar Sumi Published :Tuesday, 15 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 28Hundreds of women and girls accessed medical treatment in 2015 after experiencing sexual and gender-based violence at Kamrangirchar in Dhaka.

GSK to split after striking Pfizer consumer health deal,,,None,"LONDON, Dec 19: GlaxoSmithKline plans to split into two businesses - one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products - after forming a new joint venture with Pfizer's consumer health division.

The revamp is the boldest move yet by GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year.

It will lead to the creation of a consumer health giant with a market share of 7.3 per cent, well ahead of its nearest rivals Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and Sanofi, all on around 4 per cent.

Walmsley has previously played down the idea of breaking up the group, something that a number of investors have called for over the years.

On Wednesday, however, she announced that GSK and Pfizer would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 per cent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction.

GSK said the deal laid the foundation for the creation of two new UK-based global companies focused on pharma/vaccines and consumer healthcare within three years of the transaction closing.

For Pfizer, the deal resolves the issue of what to do with its consumer health division, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, after an abortive attempt to sell it outright earlier this year.

GSK, whose consumer products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, had withdrawn from that earlier Pfizer auction process but Walmsley said the opportunity to strike an all-equity deal cleared the way for the new agreement.

""It's something we've been able to do quickly and quietly,"" she told reporters in a conference call. -Reuters

""What this deal is all about is the opportunity to strengthen two businesses - a world-leading consumer healthcare business and a new GSK that is focused on pharma and vaccines.""

Shareholders welcomed the news and the shares jumped 7 per cent, with Jefferies analysts saying the future separation could crystallize value.

The new joint venture with Pfizer is expected to generate total annual cost savings of 500 million pounds by 2022 for expected total cash costs of 900 million and non-cash charges of 300 million. GSK plans divestments of some 1 billion pounds.

Walmsley said there would be an inevitable impact on jobs but there was also an opportunity for cost savings in procurement and across the supply chain.

The Pfizer deal is expected to boost adjusted earnings and free cashflow in the first full year after closing, which GSK anticipates will occur in the second half of 2019.

Pfizer, which already has a long-standing HIV medicines joint venture with GSK, said the transaction would be slightly accretive in each of the first three years after it closed.

The consumer tie-up follows a deal by GSK earlier this year to buy Novartis's stake in their consumer joint venture for $13 billion and comes as Walmsley tries to reshape Britain's biggest drugmaker, which has seen its shares move sideways for years.","['split', 'deal', 'consumer', 'joint', 'striking', 'pfizer', 'opportunity', 'venture', 'billion', 'walmsley', 'gsk', 'health']","LONDON, Dec 19: GlaxoSmithKline plans to split into two businesses - one for prescription drugs and vaccines, the other for over-the-counter products - after forming a new joint venture with Pfizer's consumer health division.

A stigma on civilisation,Same-sex marriage is now valid in more than two dozen countries including America. Most of the European countries have approved and legalised gay marriage. Recently the US Supreme Court has validated gay marriage in all the states of America on the premise that same-sex marriage is a people's fundamental right.,,2015-09-01 00:00:00,"Same-sex Marriage A stigma on civilisation Farook Ahmed Published :Tuesday, 1 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 92 Same-sex marriage is now valid in more than two dozen countries including America. Most of the European countries have approved and legalised gay marriage. Recently the US Supreme Court has validated gay marriage in all the states of America on the premise that same-sex marriage is a people's fundamental right. The American Judges take their oath of impartiality and fairness by placing their hands on the holy book, Bible. The paradox is that gay marriage is unbiblical. Evidently the US Supreme Court has ruled against Bible and nature. No Muslim country has, till now, legalised same-sex marriage. It is unthinkable for a Muslim country to sanction such marriage because the Quran explicitly condemns and disapproves it. It is undeniable that gay marriage is immoral and anti-nature.

The percentage of homosexuals in those societies is less than five per cent, notwithstanding that the legalised immorality is forced upon 95 per cent people. In most of the countries same-sex marriage has not been legalised by popular vote but by court decree. Nowhere gay marriage has popular mandate. Those saner people who oppose gay marriage are branded as bigots, hate-monger and preacher of hatred. We oppose gay marriage as it is unnatural, immoral and irreligious. The Bible, the Quran and the Torah equally and vociferously prohibit and condemn such marriage. We do not find homosexuality even among the lower animals.

Now let us see what the Bible says about homosexuality. ""Homosexual offenders are equated with the adulterers, prostitutes and thieves. God has made male and female to be united as one and what God has joined together, man should not separate it"" (Matt-19:4-6). Again the Bible emphatically says that sexually immoral, idolaters, homosexual will never enter into the kingdom of God (Cor 6:9-10). The Jewish holy book the Torah asseverates that homosexuality is a vicious sin. The Bible and the Torah do not approve of decriminalisation of homosexual acts. The Bible also enjoins upon the Christians not to lie with a man as one lies with a woman because that is detestable (Lev 18:22). Islam strictly forbids homosexuality in its all shapes and forms. The Quran declares---""Indeed you approach men with desire, instead of woman, rather you are a transgressing people (Al-Araf 80-81). Again in the similar vein the Quran says-""Do you indeed approach men with desire, instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly (Al Naml 27:55).

The Muslims, the Christians and the Jews are called the people of the book. These three nations have descended from the same ancestry. The three holy books of these three dominant nations condemn and disapprove gay marriage in no uncertain terms. Since gay marriage is not religiously sanctioned, no Church can perform gay marriage. A Christian marriage that is not solemnised and sanctioned by Church is not valid. Till now we know of no gay marriage which has been performed by catholic or protestant Church. Priest Valentine lost his life for performing a valid marriage. Now we are afraid many priests might be jailed or be given harsher punishment for not agreeing to perform unbiblical gay marriage.

Gay marriage is a social blight. It spreads life-threatening diseases like HIV Aids, Syphilis, Gonorrhoea and Hepatitis-B. Research has shown that homosexuals die earlier than heterosexuals. The bane of gay marriage is loud and clear. Gay marriage means redefinition of sexual morality which the Christian Churches vehemently oppose to accept because Church sees marriage as sacrament. Major religions postulate that 'Penetration' constitutes sexual intercourse. When two men sexually unite, penetration occurs. But in the matter of lesbianism the case is different. When two women attempts to join sexually, penetration does not happen. Perhaps for this reason there is no clear mention of lesbianism in the Quran, the Bible or the Torah.

However, this does not mean that lesbianism is permitted as there is no mention of it in the religious scriptures. The Bible, the Quran and the Torah emphatically direct the adherents to stay away from any detestable acts. Certainly lesbianism is most abominable act. Hence it is as illegal as homosexuality. Homosexuals and lesbians pollute and corrupt a society morally and spiritually.

The view that gay marriage is a fundamental right is totally a misplaced notion. Any claim against nature, decency and morality cannot be considered as a fundamental right. Rather it is fundamentally wrong and vicious. Psychologists say Homosexuals and lesbians are mentally and sexually perverts. Sex between man and woman is a divine blessing. We need to maintain its celestial sanctity. The inexpressible pleasure and delight that emanates from sexual union of man and woman is not comparable to any mundane joy and ecstasy.

In the days of yore when numbers of women were far less than that of men owing to high mortality rate of baby girl and female infanticide, and human beings were almost on par with animals, men turned to men for carnal satisfaction. With the gradual dawn of civilisation, human beings progressively became de-animalised, refined and conscientiously prudent and they redefined their code of sexual behaviour---that man shall seek comfort only in woman.

The formidable disease AIDS is said to have originated in Africa from the vice of unnatural anal intercourse of people. About 30 per cent people of the African continent are infected with AIDS virus. These infected people are slowly but surely awaiting their premature deaths. The courts that have given legitimacy to gay marriage has, in fact, no authority to rule against natural laws, standard morality, peoples' belief systems, religious injunctions and above all time-honoured social customs, ethics and decency. Presumably the courts were succumbed to extraneous pressure.

Gay marriage is out and out indecent, repugnant to popular taste, antithetical to virtue and rectitude, contrary to marital fidelity and opposed to the general ethos of the majority people. So gay marriage should be seen as a social vice, a wrecker of morality and spirituality, animalisation of human beings, corrupter of man and woman's sacred nuptial relationship, and finally a blight on civilisation.

Already people are questioning about the overlooking of Tom Hanks in the Oscar 2014. This legendary actor was last nominated for ""Cast Away"" and after that Oscar slipped his hand for not only once but six times. It was assumed that Tom Hanks will come away with at least two Oscar nominations this year for his excellent performance in ""Captain Phillips"" and ""Saving Mr. Banks"". But surprisingly this year also he lost this nomination to Christian Bale, Bruce Dern, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Matthew McConaughey and even Leonardo DiCaprio. It is a particular shame because the original magic of Tom Hanks returned after a long time.

What is happening ""Inside Llewyn Davis""?

When Oscar Isaac got nomination in Globes as Best Actor in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", there was no doubt that Oscar nomination is for surely for him. But he was snubbed as well. Beside him, the film itself was snubbed. This film was nominated for only two categories, Sound Mixing and Cinematography. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was in top position in ""Best of 2013"" picks, therefore, it is sad to see such work go relatively out shined in the Academy Award.



Robert Redford

Another name nominated for the Globes and not for the Oscars was Robert Redford. This classic actor was sure to at least get a nomination for Best Actor but surprisingly he was not.

""Dallas Buyers Club"" piles up nominations

It was inevitable that Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto will get noms as Best Actor and Best Supporting Role for their dynamic performances as HIV-suffering figures of the AIDS movement. However, the biggest surprise is that how many nominations the film received. Aside from the two main positions, 'Dallas' walked away with a total of six nominations including one for Best Picture.



""Philomena"" & ""Her""

The word was going around against ""Philomena"" and ""Her"" to be in the list of Best Picture. But Stephen Frears little British charmer and Spike Jonze's techno-romance finally made the list. The biggest shocks, snubs and surprisesShumona Sharmin SharnaThe 2014 Oscar nominations for....and the award goes to....., certainly not ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". All the preparation for the biggest movie awards is almost at the end. Nominations have been announced.Dated on March 2, the Academy Awards (Oscar) 2014 is bringing up a numbers of surprises. Many actors and films overlooked whereas some movies got attention that they were not supposed to. Observer presents some biggest shocks and snubs of the most desired film award, Oscar 2014.""The Butler""Oprah Winfrey was very much on discussion because of ""Lee Daniels' The Butler."" Many assumed that she will get nominations for this Oscar, but not only Oprah, the whole movie didn't get a single nomination in Academy Award this year except having had three Screen Actors Guild (SAG) nominations.
