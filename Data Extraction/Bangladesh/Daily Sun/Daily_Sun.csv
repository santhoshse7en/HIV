MAKER OF POTENTIAL HIV CURE SPEAKS UP!,"News of a ""potential HIV cure"" had many on social media in a frenzy, but the maker of the drug has moved to temper expectations, saying more trials are needed, and the process is in its infancy.",,2018-11-08T19:00:03.000Z,"News of a ""potential HIV cure"" had many on social media in a frenzy, but the maker of the drug has moved to temper expectations, saying more trials are needed, and the process is in its infancy.Israeli-based pharmaceutical company, Zion Medical, which recently broke the news of a successful first clinical trial for what they called a potential HIV cure, has issued a further statement on Twitter making it clear that more trials will be needed, and their official results will need to be published and peer-reviewed.Since the company made the announcement on 31 October, there has been a wave of excitement on social media in particular, with people clamouring for more information on the ""potential cure"".According to the World Health Organisation, at the end of 2017 approximately 36.9 million people worldwide were living with HIV.In a statement at the time, Zion Medical announced the results of the first clinical trial of its HIV-drug Gammora, which, the company said, eliminated up to 99% of the HI virus within four weeks of treatment.Nine HIV-infected patients took part in ""Part I and II"" of the trial, at Dr. Ronald Bata Memorial Hospital in Entebbe, over 10 weeks.But the company has moved to temper expectations, saying on Twitter: ""We want to thank everyone for their interest in the promising results of our first clinical trial. Like you, we are hopeful that #Gammora may one day offer those affected by #HIV a viable path to ridding themselves of infection. Much work remains in this mission including additional trials, publication of results and the steps required to make #Gammora commercially available.""We are not there yet, but we are a step closer, hopeful – and committed to keeping you informed of our progress.""The company also acknowledged that the official results should be peer-reviewed in a scientific journal, which it hopes to have done in early 2019.Lengthy processProfessor Adrian Puren, Head of the HIV Surveillance and Sero-Molecular Diagnostic Section at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), told Health24 that there is a lengthy process that needs to be followed, before being bold enough to call the drug a potential cure.""You would need to go through several stages to prove something like this. Doing the research, gathering the evidence and building up all that's required to find some potential is important.""There are different phases that you would need to go through as well. You may need to do an animal trial, then a small human trial - the process is complex and you may need to start out really small and run several tests in order to determine that the drugs aren't toxic and that there aren't any harmful side effects.""You would also need to test the efficacy of the medication at various stages, going through the different phases of trials. At some stage you would also need to run randomised tests so that you eliminate biases from the research and really make sure people aren't being harmed.""Going through something like this is not easy. It is highly complex, needs to be detailed and it's quite expensive. If I were going to look into this drug, I would want to see the published literature and be able to trace everything back to the authors, knowing that everything has been reviewed.""Once all of the research has been done, it's been reviewed and it is run through all the regulatory authorities, various ethics boards, and sufficiently scrutinised, then a company will be able to make a statement like that. And when they do make announcements like this, they usually do it at big conferences,"" said Puren.The Health Department's Deputy Director General for HIV/AIDS, TB and Maternal, Child and Women's Health, Dr Yogan Pillay, added, ""As far as we are aware, there is no published clinical trials on this.""Unless this is published in peer reviewed journals and the World Health Organisation approved this drug, we cannot take this claim seriously.""QuackeryOn Tuesday, a prominent SA HIV scientist slammed the ""cure"", which was widely being punted on social media, as smacking of ""quackery"".""The HIV world has seen quackery in different forms for decades – sadly this smacks of more of it,"" Professor Francois Venter from the University of Witwatersrand's Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, told Health-e News.He said that saying the drug is a potential cure with no side-effects are ""over-the-top biological claims that appear in public before the formal literature [is published] and should be viewed with deep scepticism"".""I looked at the press report and the unsophisticated company website, and even if you believe their claims, they are many years away from testing them,"" said Venter.Zion Medical is a relatively new company, established in 2014. According to the company website, it develops AIDS and Cancer curing products based on peptides derived from HIV and targeted lentivirus particles.It lists its partners as The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Sinai Hospital in New York (USA), and the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, among others.All of Health24's attempts to contact Zion Medical directly for further comment have so far been unsuccessful - all forms of electronic mails have been undeliverable due to an invalid email address and all telephone calls go unanswered.- Health24","['potential', 'need', 'trial', 'trials', 'results', 'medical', 'speaks', 'hiv', 'cure', 'published', 'maker', 'company', 'health']","News of a ""potential HIV cure"" had many on social media in a frenzy, but the maker of the drug has moved to temper expectations, saying more trials are needed, and the process is in its infancy.

AIDS CURE A POSSIBILITY!,"FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s boasting, in a tweet, about Mzansi having the largest HIV/Aids treatment programme in the world brought to mind the story of an alleged breakthrough by a Chinese scientist, He Jianku.",,2019-02-03T06:00:22.000Z,"FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s boasting, in a tweet, about Mzansi having the largest HIV/Aids treatment programme in the world brought to mind the story of an alleged breakthrough by a Chinese scientist, He Jianku.First, Zuma wrote that more than3,9 million people were on the supposedly life pro-longing antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as of August 2017.At the time, the number of Mzansi HIV-positive people was said to be at more than 70 million.Now, Jianku has apparently edited or modified the DNA of recently-born twin girls, Lulu and Nana, such that they are protected from contracting the Aids-causing HIV.Surely, that should be a feat worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize.But there’s a big problem.Soon after revealing the results of his exploits in November, Jianku allegedly received death threats and went missing in early December.The scientist has also been vilified.The scientific community has accused him of ethical issues and experimenting on humans with a dangerous technology, a gene-editing tool called, CRISPR-Cas9.But this accusation assumes other sorts of accepted hi-tech products, like cars, aren’t dangerous.Also, Jianku might be facing possible corruption and bribery charges, which are punishable by death in China.The Chinese scientist appears to be truly some kind of a threat to business as usual, a problem to be neutralised or eliminated at all costs.Come to think of it, what will happen to the profits of pharmaceutical companies producing ARVs and other medication fed to those said to be infected by the virus?The 3,9 million people or the targeted more than 7 million South Africans living with Aids are simply a market, not humans, for pharmaceutical companies.Jianku, just like former president Thabo Mbeki, is trying to mess with the wealth accumulation programme, camouflaged as fake care, of some multinational corporates.In the name of health, many people are turned into addicts of chronic and other medication every day, so they become repeat customers.HERE’S the most revealing line from the Jianku affair: there’s fear that changes made on the DNA of the babies could be passed on to their next generations.Since when is passing on good genes, especially those that could possibly protect against diseases like HIV/Aids, be a bad thing?Perhaps, Jiaku’s achievement presents an opportunity.Governments of the continent might want to request Chinese authorities to donate Jianku to the Motherland instead of putting him to death.Africa could do with such a maverick, especially since it has been reported that 70% of the global HIV market (totaling nearly 37 million) is in Africa.","['aids', 'programme', 'possibility', 'president', 'million', 'pharmaceutical', 'mzansi', 'jianku', 'cure', 'chinese', 'theres', 'revealing', 'scientist']","First, Zuma wrote that more than3,9 million people were on the supposedly life pro-longing antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as of August 2017.

She said the boy later told his social worker his father had raped him. “He said he feared talking about it because his gogo once walked in on his dad putting his penis in his bum but she quickly closed the bedroom door and didn’t say anything.” Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said the case was closed in April. He advised the mum to approach the sexual offences unit for more information.","['father', 'closed', 'son', 'rapist', 'told', 'hiv', 'worker', 'learned', 'social', 'dad', 'mum', 'case', 'raped']","A MUM is still trying to come to terms with the pain of knowing her nine-year-old son was raped and infected with HIV by his father.

MYTHS PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE ABOUT HIV/AIDS!,"HIV has become completely manageable, but it is surprising how many people still believe some of the misconceptions about the condition.",,2018-12-04T21:00:03.000Z,"HIV has become completely manageable, but it is surprisinghow many people still believe some of the misconceptions about the condition. The theme of 2018 is “Know your status”, which emphasises theimportance of getting tested.Here are a couple of misconceptions that need to be clearedup. Some are harsh and ignorant untruths while others are just absolute myths.1. Only 'high-risk people such as homosexuals andpromiscuous people' should be tested for HIV.First, what defines “high risk”? Being with one long-termpartner does not mean that you will never contract HIV.“HIV can happen to anyone. It’s not a disease of thepromiscuous. Think about survivors of rape or someone born with HIV,” saysBarbara Kingsley, an HIV activist who was diagnosed in 2000.And regardless of that, no-one should be shamed for theirsexual choices and lifestyle.It’s important to know your status as symptoms may notmanifest for years and people can be completely unaware that they have HIV. Theearlier you know your status, the earlier you can start taking antiretrovirals(ARVs) to combat the virus and take control of your status. You will also needto know your status to reduce the risk of infecting other possible sexualpartners.Regular testing will also help you raise awareness and breakthe stigma surrounding HIV/Aids by improving the negative attitudes andperceptions in your own family and circle of friends, even if you are with along-term partner or not having sex at all.2. You will get very sick and die if you are HIV positive.Yes, HIV can lead to Aids. Yes, Aids can be fatal. Does thismean that you are immediately doomed as soon as you are tested positive?Certainly not. Nowadays, HIV is well controlled through ARVs, and many HIVpositive people live completely healthy, happy lives.It may take years for the immune system to deteriorate tosuch an extent that someone living with HIV becomes ill and is diagnosed withAids. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV willprogress to Aids if not treated with ARVs. This will usually happen after about10 to 15 years, and before it happens, people with HIV may look and feelperfectly well and can continue life to the fullest.HIV is no longer a death sentence and the sooner you aretested, the sooner you can start the proper treatment.3. 'I will never contract HIV/Aids. It’s a disease that onlypoor people get.'This statement is so harsh that you cannot imagine anyonesaying it out loud. The truth is, HIV is blind to colour or economic status.According to a paper published in the journal AIDS, stigmasurrounding HIV/Aids is a big factor in the limitation of proper treatment. You as an individual might feel helpless in the face of thequest to find a cure for HIV, or to ensure that everyone has access to medicineand medical care. But what you can do is to start changing the views andperceptions of people in your immediate circle, which can have a wider effecton society.4. 'He/she is very skinny. They must have HIV/Aids.'Progressive Aids in its end stages can cause weight loss andan impaired immune system. Untreated HIV can lead to Aids. However, there is noway of telling someone’s status by simply looking at them.Physical signs and symptoms can take years to manifest ormay never do so, especially when an HIV positive person is taking ARVs and hasa healthy, active lifestyle.5. It’s impossible to marry/have a sexual relationship ifyou are HIV positive.Unprotected sex is the most common way of spreading HIV. Butwith protection, there is no reason why an HIV positive person can’t have afulfilling relationship with an HIV negative person.With proper treatment and management through ARVs, there isa chance that the viral load (the presence of HIV in your blood) may beundetectable. Research has shown that having an undetectable viral load canlead to little to no risk of spreading the virus to other people.However, Barbara Kingsley says that it remains importantalways to use protection, no matter what your viral load:""The goal of ARVs is for the virus to eventually becomeundetectable. This means that if you have an undetectable viral load for aperiod of six months or longer you cannot pass the virus on to others. It isvery important to understand that this doesn't protect you against pregnancy orany other STD, and that you can still practise irresponsible sex — you shouldideally be in a monogamous, long-term relationship. An undetectable state canONLY be achieved with ARVs, something that has been scientifically proven andinternationally accepted. (It, however, doesn’t mean that you can haveunprotected sex as you wish.)""Health24 previously told the story of Quinton Jonck, a SouthAfrican living with HIV. He said the following: “My wife is wonderful – I tried to break it off with herearly on in our relationship because I believed we had no future. She wanted tohear nothing about that and two years later we got married. “Five years after we got married we had our first child. Hewas conceived using a procedure called sperm washing and insemination. When wehad the next two children, I was on medication to take my viral load down tozero and we took a chance just at the right time. Now we have three children –two boys and a girl [all HIV negative].  “We are very happy and my wife is still HIV negative afteralmost 14 years of marriage. Although we only found out about my status afterwe met, we have always used condoms.Get testedIt's important to know your status. You can get tested atany of the following institutions, in both the public and private sectors:HospitalsClinicsPharmacies who offer clinic servicesCommunity health centresFamily planning clinicsSTD clinicsPathological laboratoriesMake sure that these institutions offer HIV/Aids counsellingto help you process the result and to answer any further questions.SOURCE: NEWS24","['undetectable', 'aids', 'myths', 'virus', 'hiv', 'arvs', 'tested', 'sex', 'hivaids', 'status', 'believe', 'know', 'viral']","HIV has become completely manageable, but it is surprising how many people still believe some of the misconceptions about the condition.

She said she was only 17 when she was infected by her boyfriend, a well-known singer who has since died.“We had sex without a condom because no one spoke about it. I feared pregnancy more than HIV because I thought it only affected older people,’ she said. “I thought I couldn’t have it because I was young, beautiful and chubby. I associated it with people from poor communities and thought they looked skinny with their hair falling out.” Lebogang said even after the man who infected her had told her the truth and died, she didn’t believe she could have HIV. Three years later, Lebogang met a new man and he insisted they go for an HIV test after the condom they used burst. “I started taking my medication because it was the right thing to do, but I didn’t understand the importance of it. “I later joined a church where the pastor claimed he could cure the disease and stopped taking my medication. “I got very ill and was hospitalised for six months and was bedridden,” said Lebogang.She said after she almost died, she decided to become involved in activism to educate young people about sex and HIV. “I came up with the name uBabe we HIV to bring attention to the topic and break the stigma around the disease,” she said.","['thought', 'ubabe', 'life', 'told', 'truth', 'taking', 'hiv', 'died', 'cost', 'sex', 'started', 'young', 'denial', 'nearly']","SHE calls herself uBabe we HIV and shares the naked truth about living with the virus.

SA PASSES FOR HIV TREATMENT BUT FAIL FOR CONDOMS,"While South Africa has increased HIV spending at district level with stellar results, access to condoms has plummeted, according to the latest District Health Barometer (DHB).",,2019-02-02T06:30:02.000Z,"While South Africa has increased HIV spending at district level with stellar results, access to condoms has plummeted, according to the latest District Health Barometer (DHB). District health expenditure on HIV has more than doubled in the last decade, which is an indicator of “significant progress” in moving towards a primary health care-oriented system, according to the Health Systems Trust’s (HST) Candy Day, who was commenting on the 13th edition of the DHB. Play Video1m 0sThe HIV prevention drug dividing opinionPrep is a drug which can stop people getting HIV but not everyone wants to take it.Published on Thursday evening by the HST, the report revealed that, as a percentage of total spending on HIV, district health service expenditure has jumped from 7.3% to over 20% over the past 14 years. But, consistent condom use “continues to be low” and can be linked the number of condoms distributed by government, which fell sharply over the past year. Between 2016/17 and 2017/18, the condom distribution rate dropped from an average of 48 to 36 condoms distributed per adult male per yearHowever, the researchers suggested that the rate may have been historically lower than reported and that this might be the most accurate estimate for condom distribution South Africa has ever had. They noted that this was because the data source for these statistics has recently changed and is now “more accurate than the recording done by facilities in the past”.Day, who is a technical specialist for the HST, told Health-e News that the increase of district-level spending has been largely driven the country’s continuously expanding HIV treatment programme which remains the largest in the world. Over four million people access antiretroviral medication through the state - mostly at primary level - which has driven this positive shift in expenditure. “Primary health care is the level of care that is the closest to the community and therefore has an important role in responding to the immediate healthcare needs of the community and preventing further ill health,” according to the report. At a time when the feasibility of the government’s National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme is being routinely questioned, the report authors noted that this shift in spending is essential because primary health care is the “fundamental building block” and “heartbeat” of the NHI. “There is overwhelming international evidence that increased health expenditure is associated with better health outcomes – and [primary health care] plays a pivotal role in improving the health of communities.”– Health-e News.Amy Green","['fail', 'condoms', 'care', 'rate', 'primary', 'hiv', 'passes', 'report', 'condom', 'spending', 'role', 'treatment', 'shift', 'health']","The HIV prevention drug dividing opinionPrep is a drug which can stop people getting HIV but not everyone wants to take it.

HOW TO FIGHT AGAINST HIV,THE fight to find a cure for HIV/Aids is ongoing.,Kopano Monaheng,2019-02-11T12:02:01.000Z,"THE fight to find a cure for HIV/Aids is ongoing.But it is not just government’s duty. It is everyone’s responsibility. The public, with private health organisations and NGOs, need to promote and practise safer sex.Mo-Afrika Itlhokomele is a community-based organisation that offers education on health. They go around Pimville and neighbouring areas to talk about condom use, especially during STI/Condom Week, which starts today and ends on Friday, 15 February.Joseph Didishe, the operational manager at Mo-Afrika Itlhokomele, said: “While many people are willing to listen and talk about HIV/Aids and safer sex, many will not use condoms.“Many women complain about the new women’s condom. They say the sponge inside irritates them.“Men complain that traditional male condoms reduce the feeling of sex and pleasure of the orgasm.”Didishe said, during their outreach drive, they also visit people at home because not everyone is comfortable talking about sex in public.Places on their agenda this week include eMaganda Gandeni near Orlando East, Holomisa in Nancefield, the Nancefield Hostel and Nomzamo. They will also be in Pimville zone 9 – also known as zone 14 – where they will be doing HIV tests.“Our purpose is to reach as many people as possible in the week and convince them to practise safer sex by using condoms and having sex in a committed relationship.“Condoms are contraceptives that prevents unprepared pregnancies.”He said the staff of Mo-Afrika Itlhokomele also discuss the social issues affecting people who come to the talks so the discussion also includes topics about health and lifestyle.All the people they visit or see all the time are given free packs of condoms to use whenever needed.But Didishe said people also need to take themselves to clinics and check on their health status.“We also go to schools and talk to pupils about crime, life in general as well as sex education.”SunHealth interviewed some of the people who visited the Mo-Afrika stall:Zanele Tshabalala (33) and Irene Netshirungulu (32) said they use condoms because they don’t want to fall pregnant unexpectedly.Lindiwe Nyembe (30) said she doesn’t use condoms because she has a stable partner.

The 24-year-old who recently released his 10th album called Yadli’intshebe, said he has a track on his album Sula Izinyembezi about what has killed so many maskandi artists.Khuzwayo, who was born in Nquthu in northern KZN, said he believed many maskandi artists died of Aids because they were not careful. “When they become famous, they have many girlfriends and they get confused. Sadly, most of them don’t use protection and then die of Aids,” he said. “I don’t want to mention names but I want to warn those who are still alive not to fall into the same trap.” Khuzwayo encouraged those who were HIV-positive to seek the right treatment. “It’s unfortunate that many maskandi artists don’t belive they can live better lives if they take treatment,” he said. “Many of them are too shy to come forward, get tested and use ARVs. “Others run to traditional healers because they believe they can help them.” The Impiyamatekisi hitmaker said when maskandi artists became ill, they didn’t want to tell the truth about their situation. “They usually say they have been bewitched by their rivals because of their talent,” he said. “They go to traditional healers for help but those healers don’t tell them the truth. “Traditional healers end up treating the wrong diseases while the person has HIV.” He said many people had asked him to quit music because they believed other artists were bewitching them. “I told them there is no witchcraft in the industry but many artists are killed by HIV because of fame. If you behave the right way, you live longer,” he said.Khuzwayo, who is one of very few musicians who plays a 12-string guitar, worked with the late Mgqumeni Khumalo on his debut album Siqhathwe eNquthuin 2009.","['killed', 'aids', 'dont', 'live', 'artists', 'maskandi', 'healers', 'beware', 'traditional', 'right', 'album', 'tell']","The 24-year-old who recently released his 10th album called Yadli’intshebe, said he has a track on his album Sula Izinyembezi about what has killed so many maskandi artists.

He has already served 10 years of his sentence.Criminalising the transmission of HIVJoining delegates to the International AIDS Conference by phone from his Idaho prison, Thomas said that while he regretted not disclosing his HIV status, “I worked with my doctor to protect my partner.”“It is high time to look at the growing move to criminalise the transmission of HIV, which is often based on a misunderstanding of how HIV is and isn’t transmitted,” said Professor Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International AIDS Society.Twenty top scientists, including Nobel Laureate Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, released a consensus statement at the conference yesterday after reviewing the best available scientific evidence relating to HIV transmission and concluded:It is not possible for an HIV positive person to transmit the virus in their saliva while kissing, biting or spitting.The risk of HIV transmission from a single act of unprotected sex is very low, and there is no possibility of transmission during either vaginal or anal sex if the HIV-positive partner has an undetectable viral load.It is not possible to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt that one person has infected another, even with the most advanced phylogenetic scientific tools.Some 68 countries have laws that criminalise HIV non-disclosure, exposure or transmission, while 33 others have applied similar laws in specific cases.Convicted for breastfeedingThousands of people living with HIV have been prosecuted, most of who did not actually pass on the virus.

Is HIV/AIDS A DISABILITY?,"For the past 28 years, the 1st of December has been commemorated as World AIDS Day",,2017-12-01T15:30:01.000Z,"For the past 28 years, the 1st of December has been commemorated as World AIDS Day, highlighting the plight of the pandemic and also celebrating the momentous strides made in combating the virus.  On its 29th anniversary, under the theme, “The Right to Health”, the day’s focus will be on raising awareness and educating people on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome(HIV/AIDS). In a country where over seven million people (12,6% of the population) are living with HIV, there have been calls to categorise the epidemic as a disability. Disability expert at Progression, Justene Smith, argues the pandemic can lead to disabilities. “There are situations where HIV/AIDS can prevent an individual from performing the inherent requirements of their job and can have a negative impact on their performance. In such cases, HIV/AIDS could be classified as a disability or a progressive disability, to be specific,” Smith says.Because HIV/AIDS attacks the immune system, this can cause, among other things, the degeneration of bone tissue and cartilage, resulting in chronic osteoarthritis, which itself can be classified as a disability, Smith explains.  “This is most likely to occur before an individual who is HIV/AIDS positive has started their treatment or does not take their medication at all,” clarifies Smith.But Smith admits the use of antiretrovirals (ARV’s) can sometimes also ensure that persons who are HIV positive lead a healthy lifestyle and live a normal life, without the virus causing any interference in those individuals’ lives.  “The effects of ARV’s in helping persons with HIV/AIDS is well documented, but the treatment can have side effects which, although rarely, couldresult in the person using them acquiring a disability,” says Smith “We have experienced cases where ARV’s have caused people to lose their eyesight. In such cases, visual impairment would be considered the disability and not HIV/ AIDS,” Smith explains. HIV/AIDS or ARV’S can result in a person acquiring a disability but the virus itself is very rarely considered a disability. HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, the body’s natural defence against illness. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell. As HIV destroys more CD4 cells, it gradually breaks down a person’s immune system.Additional information: What is HIV/ AIDSHIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, our body’s natural defence against illness. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell. As HIV destroys more CD4 cells, it gradually breaks down a person’s immune system. The immune systems of persons living with HIV, and not receiving treatment, will find it harder and harder to fight off infections and diseases.It may take up to 10 or 15 years for the immune system to be compromised- a point where it can no longer defend itself, if HIV is left untreated.When the HI Virus has destroyed the vast majority of CD4 cells and the human body will no longer be able to fight off infections and diseases, it is at this stage that HIV becomes AIDS. If left untreated, AIDS will result in death. HIV / AIDS StatisticsThere are 7,06 million people living with HIV in South Africa. An estimated 12,6% of the total population is HIV positive. Approximately one-fifth of South African women in their reproductive ages (15-49 years) are HIV positive.","['virus', 'smith', 'hiv', 'persons', 'positive', 'disability', 'hivaids', 'immune', 'system', 'cd4']","In such cases, HIV/AIDS could be classified as a disability or a progressive disability, to be specific,” Smith says.

‘HEALED’ – BUT DEAD!,"FOR four years, Zakhele lived a healthy life with HIV.",Ntando Mlotshwa and Sthembiso Lebuso,2019-03-26T06:00:57.000Z,"FOR four years, Zakhele lived a healthy life with HIV. But he made a decision that proved to be fatal. “He said he was healed and stopped taking ARVs,” said his sister Nomthandazo Ndaba.The 40-year-old from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, said her brother started attending Alleluia Ministries International in 2016.Nomthandazo said her brother was a staunch follower of the church. “He never missed a service. He insisted on going even when he was clearly not fit to attend,” she said.In October the family got a surprise visit from home-based care workers. “They came to ask us why they hadn’t seen Zakhele at the clinic. “He refused to listen to them when they begged him to take his treatment.”Zakhele died in December, aged 34. “In his final days Zakhele was weak. He had blisters all over his body. He looked nothing like the person he was when he first went to that church.” In a church video Zakhele is seen lying on a hospital bed, with Pastor Alph Lukau praying for him. After the prayers Zakhele starts walking around. A message then appears: “He’s healed of TB, diabetes and HIV.”In a statement, church spokeswoman Busi Gaca said the church believes that medicine and the church are not separate. “We have qualified medical doctors serving under Pastor Lukau,” she said.“The church always states that the person must go back to their doctors to verify their healing.” She said the video shows Pastor Lukau laying hands on the man, who then gets up after receiving healing from God. “At no stage does Pastor Lukau tell the man he’s healed. It’s rather his own testimony that he has received a miracle from God,” Gaca said.","['seen', 'zakhele', 'man', 'healed', 'dead', 'video', 'pastor', 'hes', 'person', 'lukau', 'church']","“He said he was healed and stopped taking ARVs,” said his sister Nomthandazo Ndaba.

KNOW YOUR HIV STATUS TODAY,“KNOW your status!”,Sun Reporter,2018-12-05T10:00:27.000Z,"“KNOW your status!”This is the rallying cry of World AIDS Day this year. The availability of self-screening HIV kits makes it easier for people to buy a kit and test in the privacy of their homes. According to Avert.org, South Africa has made huge improvements in getting people to test for HIV in recent years and is now almost at the 90-90-90 target with 86% of people aware of their status. But Mzansi still needs to work on reaching the people living with HIV who are unaware of their status, as they urgently need to get quality care and prevention services. ProblemsUnfortunately many barriers to HIV testing remain. Stigma and discrimination make people fear taking the HIV test. The need for confidential HIV testing is still a concern and too many people only get tested after showing the symptoms of Aids.Jackie Maimin, CEO of the Independent Community Pharmacy Association, said South Africa has the largest and most high-profile HIV epidemic in the world. An estimated 7,2 million people in South Africa were living with HIV in 2017. “We also account for a third of all new HIV infections in the southern African region. Just last year there were 270 000 new HIV infections and 110 000 deaths from AIDS-related illnesses.“Extensive HIV testing is needed to expand current treatment plans, which can make sure that all people living with HIV can lead healthy and productive lives.“The good news is that there are now a number of approved HIV self-screening kits available from local pharmacies that allow people to screen for HIV in the privacy of their own homes. The tests are highly specific for the HIV virus and have a 99% accuracy rate. They are a valuable indicator of the presence of antibodies to HIV infection.”There are two types of approved HIV self-screening tests – those that use a blood sample and those that use a saliva sample. Both are easy to use and give reliable results. Important: It takes between six to 12 weeks after the first infection for the body’s immune system to create enough antibodies to the HIV virus to be detectable by the test.","['virus', 'world', 'africa', 'south', 'hiv', 'testing', 'living', 'tests', 'status', 'know', 'today', 'test', 'selfscreening']","The availability of self-screening HIV kits makes it easier for people to buy a kit and test in the privacy of their homes.

NEW HIV TREATMENT TO BE INTRODUCED,"A single-pill HIV treatment is expected to be introduced in 2018 and is projected to save SA about R11bn over the following six years, the health ministry announced on Friday.",,2017-09-23T07:42:25.000Z,"A single-pill HIV treatment is expected to be introduced in 2018 and is projected to save SA about R11bn over the following six years, the health ministry announced on Friday.In a collaboration with international organisations and agencies, Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi reached the “breakthrough pricing agreement” which the ministry said would accelerate the availability of the first affordable, generic regimen containing antiretroviral dolutegravir. “Apart from the financial savings, which will decrease pressure on our national fiscus, its introduction will also have significant benefits for patients,” ministry spokesperson Joe Maila explained in a statement. “Dolutegravir is a highly effective antiretroviral, which is well tolerated by patients and has fewer side effects. Patients are therefore more likely to be adherent and more likely to be virally suppressed – which means that they are not likely to transmit the virus to others.” At US$75 per person, per year, the new fixed dose combination will be available to low and middle-income countries at a reduced price, Maila said.“The large volumes of ARVs purchased by South Africa were used to leverage the decrease in pricing that will benefit all low and middle income countries. The agreement is expected to accelerate treatment rollout as part of global efforts to reach all 36.7 million people living with HIV with high-quality antiretroviral therapy.” According to the ministry, the HIV programme has grown in the last nine years from 923 000 people to 3.9m at the end of August. Motsoaledi said the new dolutegravir-based fixed-dose combination will greatly benefit patients due to its “superior therapeutic qualities”. “The considerable price reductions could yield savings of up to R11.7bn over the next six years for us, which means that we can initiate additional patients on treatment with the same amount of resources. Ramping up treatment with good viral suppression will enable us to reach HIV epidemic control more quickly. We are aiming at launching the new tender in April 2018.”  News24 Sourcehttp://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/single-pill-hiv-treatment-to-save-sa-r11bn-health-ministry-20170922","['introduced', 'treatment', 'hiv']",NEW HIV TREATMENT TO BE INTRODUCED
SA LEADS WORLD IN HIV NUMBERS,SOUTH AFRICA has the largest number of HIV-infected people on ARV treatment.,AARON DUBE and KARABO RAMMUTLA,2018-12-05T13:45:02.000Z,"SOUTH AFRICA has the largest number of HIV-infected people on ARV treatment.This was announced at a media briefing by the Human Sciences Research Council (HRSC) and UNAids in Tshwane on Monday.HIV drug resistance is also a concern, according to results from the fifth South African National HIV prevalence, incidence, behaviour and communication survey. It was conducted in 2017 by the HSRC and its partners. It found resistance to antiretroviral drugs in more than a quarter of virally unsuppressed people living with HIV.Resistance to ARVs was identified in 27,4% of survey respondents who were virally unsuppressed. Drug resistance was found in 55% of respondents on treatment and not virally suppressed and in 75% of those who had stopped treatment.Resistance was also found in 15% of respondents who reported no previous exposure to ARVs and their levels of drug resistance were the same among males and females and children aged 0-14 years and youths aged 15-24 years. The survey included those who may have stopped receiving care and those accessing private sector care.One of the principal investigators, Dr Sizulu Moyo, said this was the first South African HIV household survey to include HIV drug resistance testing. “It provides information that would not be provided by regular HIV drug resistance survey that use information from public sector clinics,” she said. Another researcher, an expert on HIV drug resistance from National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Dr Gillian Hunt, said the research showed that high numbers of patients who were no longer in care had heightened resistance. She said the information supports efforts to keep patients in care, to switch failing patients to alternative regimens more quickly and to switch introduce Dolutegravir based regimens in to the national treatment programme.","['drug', 'national', 'survey', 'world', 'virally', 'resistance', 'south', 'hiv', 'leads', 'patients', 'information', 'respondents', 'numbers']","HIV drug resistance is also a concern, according to results from the fifth South African National HIV prevalence, incidence, behaviour and communication survey.

The fight against HIV is far from over for SA!,WHEN Ndlela Howard Dhlamini disclosed his HIV-positive status more than a decade ago.,Health24.com,2015-12-01T13:23:38.000Z,"WHEN Ndlela Howard Dhlamini disclosed his HIV-positive status more than a decade ago, ignorance about HIV led his local tavern to refuse to reuse the glass he drank from and his community to demand the removal of a public phone he used. As South Africa prepares to celebrate World Aids Day on 1 December, this kind of stigma fuelled by HIV myths may be a memory for Dhlamini but not for everyone living with the virus.   Dhlamini was diagnosed with HIV on his 18th birthday in 1999 after testing at a friend’s suggestion. He said he almost didn’t make it to the clinic. “I almost forgot because I was drunk and with a girl,” said Dhlamini who lives in Bohlokong township outside Bethlehem in the Free State. “I used to drink a lot and have a lot of girlfriends back home and at school in Durban.” Like many, Dhlamini said he was shocked at the diagnosis and initially reacted in anger. “At that time. I had 10 girlfriends who loved me so much because I was so popular,” said Dhlamini, who added that he had been treated for multiple sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during school. “I was so angry, I just wanted to infect them all.”Both multiple concurrent partnerships and STIs can increase a person’s HIV risk. In the case of STIs, those such as herpes and syphilis, can often lead to sores or blisters. These kinds of breaks in the skin may allow HIV to more easily into the body.  Convinced he was going to die, Dhlamini began planning his funeral programme that night. “I then went into my bedroom took an A4 page and started drafting my funeral programme,” Dhlamini remembered. “I then fell asleep and my mom came to check up on me. She found the note and she was so angry,” he said. “She said I still had my life to live, I was not going to die.” Dhlamini describes the next three years as the hardest in his life. “There was a public phone at the corner near my home,” he said. “I went there and made a phone call. After that, people protested that the public phone should be removed because (they thought) I would infect them.” “At the tavern, they had a glass marked with a black pen to show that I was the only would who could drink from it,” said Dhlamini who said the community’s stigma was fuelled by a lack of awareness about HIV was spread. HIV can only be passed from person to person via exposure to infected body fluids like blood, semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk. It is usually transmitted via unprotected sex but can also be transmitted by sharing needles or from a mother to her child during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding. You cannot catch HIV from casual contact like shaking hands or sharing food or drink with people living with HIV. Today, UNAIDS estimates about 6.8 million South Africans are living with HIV, but recent research shows levels of accurate knowledge about how the virus is transmitted are declining nationally. This decline has been accompanied by an increase in HIV risk behaviours, according to the Human Science Research Council’s latest household HIV survey. It may also be driving stigma. Released earlier this year, South Africa’s first HIV stigma index measured levels of stigma and discrimination due to HIV status among more than 10,000 people living with the disease. The survey found high levels of self blame and shame among people living with the virus. About 10 percent of those surveyed reporting being excluded from a family or social gathering in the last year and about half of these people felt their HIV status was the cause. About one in 10 of those surveyed also reported considering suicide.  Globally, fear of social rejection and discrimination are still among the most common reasons people give for avoiding HIV testing and care, according to UNAIDS. In its latest report, the UN body has argued that decreasing stigma is crucial to tackling HIV. It also highlighted succesfull ways countries around the world are tackling stigma including Ghana’s introduction of an sms and online system allowing people living with HIV to report stigma and sensitisation of health care workers in Jamaica.In South Africa, The South African National AIDS Council has partnered with Legal AID South Africa and public interest law organisation Section27 to provide legal assistance to people who believe they have been discriminated against due to their HIV status. For Dhlamini, things changed when he disclosed to his church. “People and my family started to support me,” said Dhlamini who now volunteers with the local community-based organisation Dihlabeng Development Initiative to educate people about HIV prevention and teenage pregnancy. “My family has always been there for me through it all.” – Health-e News.http://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/News/the-fight-against-hiv-is-far-from-over-for-sa-20151201","['transmitted', 'dhlamini', 'public', 'fight', 'stis', 'far', 'south', 'hiv', 'living', 'stigma', 'status', 'phone']","“There was a public phone at the corner near my home,” he said.

They take them to big, expensive and beautiful hotels. They buy women expensive shoes,” he told Umlazi residents.“Some of them even buy women cars.”They were also known as sugar daddies and a website had been created to connect young women with such men.Ramaphosa was speaking at an event to announce party’s “pedal campaign”. This would involve people using ANC-branded bicycles to venture into areas inaccessible by cars to campaign for the August 3 local government elections.“It is these blessers that are spreading HIV and Aids, because they are here, there and everywhere. And that is why we are saying down with blessers down! Down with sugar daddies, down!”He referred to President Jacob Zuma’s mention in a speech on June 16 about another phenomenon called Mavuso’s stokvel, in Hammanskraal, Pretoria. It involved men meeting women at a venue, taking them home and paying them for sex.  Ramaphosa warned that such practices helped spread HIV/Aids.“Stay away from Mavuso’s,” pleaded Ramaphosa.Sex talkEarlier on Friday, he announced an HIV campaign in Pietermaritzburg, where Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi presented a new condom called Max.He told his Umlazi audience that some men had stopped using condoms.“They want to have unprotected sex. Dr Motsoaledi said people told the government that the Choice condoms did not give them pleasure. They make noise when you use them and they do not have a scent.“So comrade Motsoaledi and the department spoke to scientists and we now have a new condom out called Max.“You will be satisfied when you use Max.

A LOT OF AIDS EDUCATION STILL NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE,"This year marks the 30th anniversary of World Aids Day and the theme is, “Know Your Status”.",,2018-12-08T09:30:12.000Z,"This year marks the 30th anniversary of World Aids Day and the theme is, “Know Your Status”.How will you know your status if you don’t get tested? Though we commemorate the 30th anniversary of World Aids Day, this virus still remains our worst adversary.We need to get tested.Knowing your status helps one to make well-informed decisions.Someone who is ignorant and reluctant to go for tests is like a reckless driver who disregard road safety rules which serve to protect their own life.  If you know your HIV status, you’ll begin to take treatment and lead a healthy lifestyle.On this year’s World Aids Day, we should personalize the risk of HIV infection. Let’s avoid engaging in unsafe sex. Condomise or abstain from sex.If you test positive, you shouldn’t lose hope and think it’s the end of the world. You’d rather start taking treatment and eating healthy foodstuff to prolong your life. Leading a reckless and unhealthy lifestyle like smoking and boozing can worsen your condition.Being HIV-positive doesn’t mean you’re useless. You can still lead a prolonged, productive life and contribute to society.HIV is manageable; however, about half of the seven million people in South Africa living with the virus are not on treatment! Not taking treatment even though you’re positive is like daring to go into a lion’s den without a weapon for self-defence.I urge people living in the rural areas to get tested and know their status.Knowing your status lifts a load off your shoulders. It frees you from possible doubt.I encourage young people as well to stop engaging in unprotected sex this festive season. Married or unmarried couples should avoid engaging in extramarital sex to avoid the spread of HIV.HIV is a burden on the shoulder of the World and as the nations, we should take a pledge in reducing infection rate. World Aids Day is a very important reminder that a lot still needs to be done all over the world to educate people about this condition.We should raise public awareness and stop the stigmatisation of people living with HIV.It doesn’t respect our status. It affects the rich and the poor, parents and children.Hellen Keller once said: “Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much. “Though this virus stands tall like a giant Goliath, our little efforts combined together can help us to be victorious over it.”  )  Amos TebeilaMohlaletse Village","['virus', 'aids', 'engaging', 'treatment', 'needs', 'world', 'day', 'living', 'education', 'sex', 'status', 'place', 'know', 'lot']","This year marks the 30th anniversary of World Aids Day and the theme is, “Know Your Status”.

AIDS BATTLE NOT YET WON!,TODAY is World Aids Day.,Sifiso Jimta,2017-12-01T06:00:27.000Z,"TODAY is World Aids Day. The South African National Aids Council has urged South Africans to mark the day by wearing a red ribbon pinned to their clothing.“About 270 000 South Africans became infected with HIV last year alone,” said council CEO Dr Sandile Buthelezi.Worldwide, about 5 000 people become infected every day.Urvashi Ramjee from Old Mutual said while improved education and access to ARVs continued to improve HIV status in South Africa, there was still a lot of work to do.“Business can play a leading role in removing the stigma attached to HIV,” she said.About seven million South Africans are HIV-positive. This is an increase from the estimated five million South Africans living with HIV in 2002.However, disability claims for the disease have gone down a lot, which indicates improved management of the disease.Old Mutual disability claims related to HIV/Aids have dropped from 16% in 2010 to 8% this year. Ramjee said the improved roll-out of ARVs in public and private hospitals and clinics had resulted in the elimination of waiting lists for ARVs. “Today ARVs are given to patients much sooner than in the past, meaning treatment is starting earlier,” she said.“Managing the disease has become less difficult for patients than for people with diabetes. “ARVs are compressed into one daily tablet, while someone with diabetes is required to change their lifestyle to manage the disease.”Ramjee said this was contributing to the second trend they had noticed in claims over the past seven years – namely, that more people with HIV are returning to the workplace, and at a much faster rate.","['aids', 'past', 'mutual', 'won', 'south', 'hiv', 'patients', 'arvs', 'africans', 'claims', 'battle', 'seven', 'improved']","The South African National Aids Council has urged South Africans to mark the day by wearing a red ribbon pinned to their clothing.

Ramaphosa said that despite the daily attacks on Mabele’s dignity, she had the resilience and fortitude to form the Positive Women’s Network at Garankuwa Hospital. Two years later she helped set up the Treatment Action Campaign to fight for the government to provide anti-retroviral treatment. She helped create safe spaces where women with HIV/Aids could go. ""Prudence bravely opened new frontiers of struggle. She was among Aids activists who were essentially fighting a struggle to be human, to be remembered as worthy, normal individuals with a manageable condition."" Mabele gave voice to thousands whose stories and experiences, fears and dreams often went unheard, Ramaphosa said.""She brought comfort to those she knew were pained by physical discomfort, social stigma and the violation of their fundamental human rights.""  She was not shy to speak truth to power and never stopped questioning or confronting those she believed were neglecting their duty to society.  Her vision was for a South African healthcare system that cared for everyone, especially the poor.  ""She dreamed of a South Africa that educated and skilled its young people. She spoke of a South Africa that had a leadership core that had integrity."" Mabele wanted a South Africa that did everything to advance the interests of all citizens, not just a few. She envisaged a South Africa free of corruption.  ""A South Africa where the resources of our nation were used efficiently and prudently to advance the lives of the poor. A South Africa where women were affirmed and felt safe. We will carry on with the fight,"" Ramaphosa said.","['struggle', 'safe', 'funeral', 'africa', 'south', 'activist', 'stigma', 'hivaids', 'praised', 'struck', 'women', 'mabele', 'ramaphosa']","WHEN HIV/Aids struck 18-year-old Prudence Mabele in the 1990s it struck a rock, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said yesterday.

His return to the township triggers a series of events as Khensani campaigns the community to boycott his taxi business, and he wrestles with the abuse his father inflicts on his mother,” said MTV.Viewers will also follow Ipeleng, Q, Zamo and Reggie as they leave school and head to university, start businesses or find jobs in the real world.Old favourites make new friends and fall in love with new people as characters like Daniel, Dineo, Kwanele, Masego and Andile enter the MTV Shuga universe.Having begun 10 years ago in Nigeria, the MTV Shuga movement has sought to tackle hard-hitting, pertinent issues without shying away from the difficulty of so doing.All of the different iterations of the show around the continent deal with real-life topics that affect the modern day youth.“The MTV Shuga directive is to educate young audiences on sexual health and engage with them on real issues that they face in their daily lives.

HIV positive and pregnant?,"While women who test positive for HIV after discovering they are pregnant find the discovery difficult to accept, there is treatment available and they can still lead a full and normal life along with their child.",News24.com,2016-08-13T08:10:29.000Z,"While women who test positive for HIV after discovering they are pregnant find the discovery difficult to accept, there is treatment available and they can still lead a full and normal life along with their child.Diarrhoea and vomitingNursing sister Puleng Mathe said although treatment sometimes had side effects, pregnant women need not despair.“It is possible to deliver a healthy child. You just have to get antiretrovirals, which you have to take twice a day. The side effects are diarrhoea and vomiting, and sometimes loss of appetite. But it eventually will stop once the body is familiar with the pill,” Sister Mathe said.Two women from the Free State who have experienced the positive effects of antiretroviral treatment have spoken out.Ntsheuwa Moloi, a 24-year-old single woman from Clarens in the Free State, fell pregnant and then later discovered she was HIV positive. She told her story to Our Health:“On September 23 last year I felt a little dizzy and I had no appetite. Looking back over the previous few weeks and how I had been feeling, I wondered if I might be pregnant. So I took a home pregnancy test, and it came back positive. I began to worry about my future as a single parent because by that stage I was separated from my boyfriend and he had moved on.“Deep down, I was excited to become a mother.'I didn't have much hope'“The first couple of months passed­­­ slowly as I struggled to get used to the pregnancy. At the end of my first trimester the gynaecologist told me he had run some blood tests. I was worried that I might have diabetes.“On the morning of December 15 I received a call to say that something had come up in my tests and I needed to go to the gynaecologist’s rooms immediately. When I got there he sat me down and told me that am HIV positive.“I couldn't believe it. The words kept repeating in my mind: HIV positive. Again and again. “I didn't have much hope, as I didn’t know much about HIV. I thought my child would have no chance in life, and all I could think of was death.“Two weeks later I went to see a doctor who specialises in high risk pregnancies. As I reached the end of my pregnancy I was told that I would deliver naturally. I went into labour on June 27 and gave birth to my daughter. I was so happy to finally meet her, and I named her Blessing. She was tested for HIV and put on antiretrovirals – which we call ""Miracle Medicine"".Motivational speaker“Her tests have come back negative. I am so happy that my daughter is healthy and she won't have to suffer because of my mistakes. I how feel like I have something worth living for.”Mpho Mofokeng (not her real name) is a 32-year-old single mother from Bethlehem who was diagnosed with HIV 10 years ago. She is a lawyer, an HIV activist, mother of a little boy and is currently working on a Bachelors degree in clinical laboratory science with the aim of getting her PHD in bio-engineering in order to do HIV/Aids research.Mpho follows a healthy eating plan, attends support groups and has become a motivational speaker, doing a lot of talks for school children.“Being HIV positive is not the end of everything.

‘LISTEN TO ME: TB CAN BE BEATEN’,,Sun Reporter,2018-12-01T13:30:03.000Z,"LEJWELEPUTSWA District in Free State Province lies amidthe famed goldfields.Like the rest of the country, the region is grapplingwith unemployment, poverty and the effects of the AIDS epidemic.  A group of health workers working there are determined nomore lives are needlessly lost and that rural patients receive excellentservice.Health Systems Trust Nurse Clinician Nthabeleng Lefuembodies this approach. As ‘Sister Lefu’ enters Phahameng Clinic, patientswaiting on benches hail her as an old friend. Nozmanga Dikano (36) bounds happily across to SisterLefu, saying: “Do you see how fat I am now, Sister?” Dikano was diagnosed with HIV in 2001 and was treatedwith Bactrim to prevent opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis pneumonia(PCP). In 2007 she was also diagnosed with TB and started on ART.“In 2010 I defaulted on treatment because I was workingas a domestic in Bloemfontein and my boss wouldn’t let me go to the clinic tofetch my medicine. I’m sorry to say that I defaulted for 10 years until I had ababy in 2017. “By the time they tested me in the antenatal screening,my CD4 count was at 111 ? it is supposed to be at least 350. “I already had three children and they are all HIV-negative,so they gave me Nevirapine to prevent me transmitting the virus to my babyduring childbirth.”Dikano said that after the birth she felt extremely weakand tired, unable to walk more than a few steps and struggling to even swallowwater. “I thought it was because I had had a Caesarean section.I was admitted to the provincial hospital for three weeks for low bloodpressure, because the X-rays didn’t show TB. I told the doctor that I’d had TBbefore and recognised this feeling, but he ignored me and just changed my ARVs.“I wasn’t getting better so I discharged myself and camehere to my local clinic to tell them what happened. The next day they sentSister Nthabeleng to my house to fetch me. My face was swollen like a footballand I was very dehydrated. My feet were icy cold and I couldn’t sleep at all. Ithought, ‘This is it. I am dying’.  “She examined me and said she thought it was TB, even ifit hadn’t shown up on the X-rays.”Dikano was placed on TB treatment and rapidly improved.“Within a week I was feeling much better. I have just one more month oftreatment, and my baby is on INH to prevent him contracting TB.”Dikano’s four children, ranging in age from infancy to 18years old, were so thrilled to see their mother improve that they soon joinedin ensuring that she stuck to her treatment. Dikano says that stigma around TB is in some ways worsethan the stigma of HIV. “I have been open about my HIV status for 20 years andbecause I always looked fine, no one was worried. But when I got really sickwith TB, even my own siblings wouldn’t allow me to stay with them because theywere afraid I would infect their children. They know it is highly contagiousand I think I looked so bad that it frightened them.”Now feeling as if she has a new lease on life, Dikano isa passionate advocate for education on TB and HIV: “I speak to everyone whowill listen about TB and HIV. I want to climb to the top of the mountain andtell the world that TB can be beaten.”To learn more about TB testing and treatment go tohttp://betteroffknowing.org.za/get-tested/tb/","['thought', 'tb', 'prevent', 'hiv', 'listen', 'feeling', 'sister', 'beaten', 'children', 'clinic', 'treatment', 'lefu']","As ‘Sister Lefu’ enters Phahameng Clinic, patients waiting on benches hail her as an old friend.

The period of national mourning following the tragic flooding and mudslides in the capital Freetown and surrounding areas is officially over.At least 500 people have been killed, with the number expected to rise. A mass burial for 300 people has been held.About 200 people living with HIV and their families were affected – 54 of them were among the dead.United Nations Aids authorities are worried that people living with HIV and people at higher risk of HIV infection often become more vulnerable in times of emergency.That’s because of a lack of prioritisation of their needs, lack of prevention services and disruption of treatment.In addition, people living with HIV, especially with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk of contracting malaria and water-borne diseases.In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the UN’s priority has been to ensure the continuation and scale-up of anti-retroviral therapy services.It must also generate strategic information for fund-raising and facilitate access for people living with HIV to food and non-food resources.The UN’s Michel Sidibe said the crisis had put into sharp focus the fragility of Sierra Leone’s post-Ebola social safety nets.“It’s critical that the resources required for the response to HIV be included in the emergency fund-raising appeals and that the country’s HIV catch-up plan be financed and implemented effectively,” said Sidibe.About 2 500 people die from Aids annually in the country.– CAJ NEWS","['killed', 'aids', 'leone', 'uns', 'mudslides', 'risk', 'sierra', 'hiv', 'living', 'crisis', '500', 'lack', 'higher']","FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONETHE people of Sierra Leone are just getting over the deadly mudslides that killed more than 500 people.

SIGNS OF IRON DEFICIENCY,STAYING healthy doesn’t require a lot of effort.,Malereko Tae,2018-11-28T12:15:03.000Z,"STAYING healthy doesn’t require a lot of effort.We need to eat the right food, avoid junk, exercise and do regular check-ups.While news is focused on scary diseases such as HIV/Aids, diabetes and cancer, there are many other problems we can avoid with a little care.They can turn deadly if ignored. Iron deficiency awareness Today is World Iron Deficiency Awareness Day, which is why Prof Vernon Louw, chairman and head of the division of clinical haematology in the Department of Medicine at the University of Cape Town, warned women to be aware of this illness.Iron deficiency affects one in two South African women.Lack of iron leads to fewer red blood cells being produced. These cells need iron to make haemoglobin, a special protein that grabs and holds onto oxygen molecules. Without iron, the body can’t make haemoglobin and red blood cells can’t transport oxygen all over the body.Louw said: “If your body doesn’t have enough haemoglobin, it has anaemia. This means your tissues and muscles won’t get enough oxygen to be able to work effectively – it’s a deadly problem.”Because iron deficiency leads to anaemia, people – women especially – need to make sure they eat iron-rich food.Common causes of iron deficiency include a lack of iron in your diet, inflammatory bowel disease, increased iron requirements during pregnancy, heavy periods or internal bleeding.Signs and symptoms of iron deficiency change in number, severity and type, depending on the anaemia levels, age and current state of health of the sufferer. In some cases, sufferers experience no symptoms.Symptoms of anaemiaGeneral fatigue or exhaustionWeaknessPale skinShortness of breath or pantingDizziness or fainting sensationsPika or the strange craving for items that are not food such as dirt, ice, or clay. Pika is common in pregnancyFormication or a tingling or crawling feeling on or in the legsA swelling or soreness of the tongue.","['need', 'anaemia', 'cells', 'leads', 'oxygen', 'deficiency', 'haemoglobin', 'signs', 'iron', 'women', 'red']","Iron deficiency awarenessToday is World Iron Deficiency Awareness Day, which is why Prof Vernon Louw, chairman and head of the division of clinical haematology in the Department of Medicine at the University of Cape Town, warned women to be aware of this illness.

4 things you need to know about having sex when you're HIV positive,"HIV certainly complicates sex, but if you take the right precautions, there’s no reason why HIV-positive women can’t enjoy a healthy sex life without passing on the virus.",Health24.com,2018-01-03T15:10:12.000Z,"Here’s what you need to know: 1. Be honest with your partnerThe first things you need to consider are “issues of disclosure – how to protect your partner and assess their HIV status, plus what to do if things go wrong,” says Dr Francois Venter, deputy director at Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute and associate professor in the Department of Medicine at Wits University.These need to be tackled before you find yourself in the moment so you can approach them with careful thought.“Plan how to have the conversation, negotiate safe sex and encourage your partner to get tested. And have a handy plan B in place in case there’s a condom break, such as taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which prevents HIV transmission,” says Dr Venter.2. Use condoms – they workThere are a lot of myths around condoms not being safe enough to protect against HIV transmission. But if used correctly, and if they don’t burst or come off, they’re 100% safe.Unfortunately, they occasionally slip or tear, in which case a small risk is present and it’s advised to get PEP from your doctor or clinic. Risk also increases during your period.3. Stick to your treatmentWith the advent of safe and effective antiretrovirals, your health returns to normal and your ability to pass on the virus is reduced almost to zero. So, accidents with condoms, or anything else, are much less likely to have consequences for your partner.4. Oral sex is low risk for passing on HIVDr Venter says, “You’ve got a bigger risk of getting struck by lightning than getting HIV from oral sex.”However, you can still catch other STIs from unprotected oral sex, so proceed with caution.- Health24","['youre', 'wits', 'condoms', 'need', 'things', 'risk', 'transmission', 'positive', 'hiv', 'sex', 'venter', 'oral', 'safe', 'know', 'having']","These need to be tackled before you find yourself in the moment so you can approach them with careful thought.

Oral sex is low risk for passing on HIVDr Venter says, “You’ve got a bigger risk of getting struck by lightning than getting HIV from oral sex.”However, you can still catch other STIs from unprotected oral sex, so proceed with caution."
Actress leads HIV/Aids fight,The factors that add to the alarming HIV infection rates and Aids-related deaths among adolescents came under the spotlight last week.,By Kopano Monaheng,2016-07-25T10:58:24.000Z,"The factors that add to the alarming HIV infection rates and Aids-related deaths among adolescents came under the spotlight last week.Mzansi-born Academy Award-winning actress and UN messenger of peace Charlize Theron spoke at the Aids 2016 conference in Durban about the work being done by the Charlize Theron Outreach Project to address HIV prevention among youth. According to UNICEF, Aids is the number one cause of death in Africa and the number two cause of death among 10 to 19-year-olds globally. Aids-related deaths among this specific age group have tripled since the year 2000. This is largely attributed to a generation of children infected with HIV before being born. This vulnerable group is reaching their teenage years without access to life-saving interventions. Since launching in 2007, the Theron project works with programmes that have reached over 1,2 million young people across South Africa. The Theron project’s support can be seen at WhizzKids United, which has helped up to 6 000 adolescents annually for the past five years.","['aids', 'number', 'fight', 'actress', 'theron', 'death', 'hiv', 'leads', 'cause', 'hivaids', 'group', 'charlize', 'project', 'deaths']","The factors that add to the alarming HIV infection rates and Aids-related deaths among adolescents came under the spotlight last week.

CONDOMISE ALWAYS TO KEEP SAFE!,"Great efforts have been made to stop the spread of HIV, but we still have a long way to go before we can completely prevent new infections.  Many people seem to use condoms only at the beginning of their relationships, but they lack consistency as time goes on.

Being in a relationship with someone means you trust them, but you don’t have to engage in unprotected sex before knowing their status and you’re ready to start a family.

I’m the only one who works, yet he complains that I order him around every day when I get home. What should I do? I really love him.  OH BOY! WHAT’S HAPPENING TO OUR MEN? Lately, they seem to be failing at work and struggling to provide. It’s never easy for any woman to stay calm when all the responsibilities are hers. Women are created to nurture, love and support their husbands. There’s so much you can do about this, as you did make a vow to stand by him for better or worse. This is the “worse” part. It’s important that you encourage him and help him remember who he was when he married you. Help him tap back into himself and his abilities. KEEP IT! This is the part that validates your union.  HE’S HIV-POSITIVE writes: Hi, sisi Khanyi. I’m a young lady from KZN who will turn 24 soon and I have a boyfriend who is 27. I’m a student and currently doing my internship at a hotel. That’s where I met my boyfriend. He broke up with his baby mama because he saw me and liked me. At first, I didn’t like him at all, but those feelings changed and became love. So when the baby mama found out we’re dating, she started calling me and threatening me to stay away from “her man”. I stayed away from him for a couple of weeks, but then we got back together. The problem is, she told me he’sHIV-positive. I was shocked because I slept with him without a condom and he took my virginity. So, after hearing that, I broke up with him. He admitted that he is indeed HIV-positive. I was so stressed! I went to the doctor and got tested myself, but the results came back negative. He kept calling me, asking for forgiveness. So now, I’ve taken him back and I love him with all my heart. Am I doing the wrong thing?  WELCOME TO LIFE, BABY GIRL! I know how beautiful love is and how it gives any woman a reason to live, but at the same time, love should be lovely, not forced, and less cloudy.  There’s nothing you can do regarding your man’s baby mama as that is his responsibility. If he loves you, he should manage this situation and it shouldn’t affect you. If you live under threats and you have no protection from your partner, then he’s not doing his duty in protecting you. So what makes you think he would protect you from any illnesses and viruses? You’re too young to be considering such major decisions. You’re educated and have the opportunity of a great life ahead of you. Marriage should wait.

A woman (37) said whenever she goes into the facility to collect her treatment, she overhears a group of people talking and laughing behind her back. “They say, ‘kushukuthi losisi uya-tracker’, which means ‘this woman is HIV-positive’,” she said. The patient said this does not make her feel good about her life. “I do not want my status to be known yet, but by collecting my treatment there I am indirectly revealing it. “I am not happy about this, but I do not know what to do about it.” The woman said she had tried to express her concerns to nurses at the new Polyclinic just a few metres away, but they simply told her there was nothing they could do to help her.“I was trying to find out if it was possible for me to get my treatment from them,” she said. “They told me that as much as they understood my frustrations, there was nothing they could do for me because the department had decided to adopt that system.” Another patient (42), also collecting treatment at the centre, said that since women did not get circumcised, it was easy for people to deduce that they were there to get HIV treatment. “We want to urge the department to consider changing this system. “Not all of us are comfortable with other people knowing our HIV status,” said the patient.Agiza Hlongwane of the health department’s communications department said: “As much as we understand the frustration of HIV-positive patients, we cannot make changes overnight.”","['revealing', 'public', 'told', 'hiv', 'patients', 'status', 'department', 'polyclinic', 'facility', 'treatment', 'woman']","THE old Polyclinic in P Section of KwaMashu, north of Durban, is an HIV centre.

He said he had been given dates for disciplinary hearings four times but his employer kept postponing. “If I’m guilty why can’t they fire me?

The SunTeam approached the human resources director at his place of work, Joseph Machaba, who said it wasn’t true that Nkosinathi warned them before his clinic appointments. “We want employees suffering from chronic diseases to inform us on time so we can adjust our roster.” He also disputed Nkosinathi’s claim that he was told not to come to work until further notice.

I don't believe in treating it like it's an unspoken subject. I want us to talk about it, because once we talk about it more, then we can de-stigmatise it.""There are people who are naysayers, but I don't even reply. I just leave them.""When I was younger, I was so scared of how people would perceive me.""But now I've grown and people's opinions really don't phase me. I think emotionally I've become stronger. When I get these comments and everything, they don't really break me.""But the response and the support is there because whether it's me or someone else, the reality is that people are living with HIV, whether we talk about it or not.""She recounts her shock at learning her status when she volunteered to be tested at school when she was 14.""I was shocked, I was in denial, I couldn't believe it. I was only 14 at the time so I was like: 'How? I'm only 14... I haven't done anything. How?” she told the BBC.""But when I got home and told my aunt and she was the one who told me that no, I'd actually been born with it. My parents had died from Aids-related diseases, which I had never known.”Her dad died when she was 9 and her mum a year later.About her own love life, Saidy told the BBC: ""I'm in a relationship currently. It's very amazing because usually I disclose right at the beginning of the relationship.""So once the person decides that they want to stay with me then it's all good, but if they decide to leave, it's still fine.""I won't hate them because people still have their own issues regarding HIV. I don't really blame the person who says: 'No I can't stay with you because you're HIV-positive'.”I try to use my story to give hope to others, and as for the stigma?

HOW SAFE ARE YOUR HAIR CLIPPERS?,The data regarding the risk of transmission of disease is shaky at best.,Snazo Notho,2018-04-23T12:00:09.000Z,"The data regarding the risk of transmission of disease is shaky at best.And the studies are nothing new, either. In 2011, the American College of Gastroenterology released an investigation into the transmission of blood-borne diseases at barbershops. It found that although there was potential for contracting hepatitis B, if instruments were not sterilised properly, more research had to be done.In 2014, dermatologist Nonhlanhla Khumalo warned people to bring their hair clippers to the barbershop. This after Nonhlanhla, who conducted two studies on the risks of getting a chiskop, found that 25% of African men bled when their hair was cut. She and a group of 10 researchers wrote the article “Blood and Virus Detection on Barber Clippers”.The study found that methylated spirits were not enough to sterilise shaving equipment. After the investigation was concluded, barbers were encouraged to use a steriliser or antiviral spray on hair-cutting equipment.But she added that the “the risk of transmission of blood-borne infection via haircuts was likely to be low, but required formal quantification.”Speaking to SunBuzz, general doctor Kamogelo Mphelo said it was impossible for hair clippers to cause any sexually transmitted diseases because proper salons used specific products to sanitise their machines.Said Kamogelo: “When it comes to diseases like hepatitis B and HIV, there has to be contamination of blood, and that doesn’t happen when one goes to cut their hair.“Even when they trim you and you find yourself bleeding, it can’t be that the blood will cause the disease, as the machines burn the blood.“They clean their machines to prevent germs, and because that is their process, I have never dealt with an incident where a person claimed they went to the barbershop and came back with a disease of some sort.”Thabiso Ngwenya said he didn’t believe the news about hepatitis B and HIV being caused by hair clippers because at school he was taught that HIV was transmitted only through sexual intercourse.Insisted Thabiso: “This whole issue instills fear. Now, we fear having sex because of sicknesses and now it’s shaving our heads, which I think is farfetched as the blood needs to be warm for the transmission to happen.”He said he couldn’t shave his head by himself and didn’t trust anyone else except his barber.On the other hand, Lebohang Nkwe is very careful.Asserted Lebohang: “I bought a set of hair clippers when the news broke late 2015. I didn’t know how to use it, but I told myself I’d.“Now, I’m the best haircutter around and I only shave myself and no one else.“It’s better to be safe because you can’t trust anyone these days.”","['blood', 'transmission', 'hepatitis', 'hiv', 'didnt', 'b', 'disease', 'hair', 'diseases', 'safe', 'clippers']","It found that although there was potential for contracting hepatitis B, if instruments were not sterilised properly, more research had to be done.

YOUNG PEOPLE DON’T USE CONDOMS!,Young people who do not like using condoms during sexual intercourse in Vhembe are the main cause behind high rate of unwanted babies and the spread of sexual transmitted infections such as HIV.,,2018-07-02T13:15:16.000Z,"Young people who do not like using condoms during sexual intercourse in Vhembe are the main cause behind high rate of unwanted babies and the spread of sexual transmitted infections such as HIV.These are the views of Tinyiko Nkanyane of Love Life. She says many rural youth still do not understand the importance of using condoms during sexual encounters, despite the free availability of condoms.Condoms are there for free“We have got a high rate of teenage pregnancies, which is a worrying factor because most of those babies are unwanted. Condoms are all over, but people still choose not to use them. Everywhere we go – be it in public toilets, government buildings, clinics, hospitals and libraries – condoms are there for free. Those condoms are made for us to protect ourselves against sexual transmitted viruses and unwanted pregnancies,” said Nkanyane, addressing more than one hundred young people at the Thulamela library hall recently.Nkanyane said it pains her when she sees young people not respecting their bodies as they end up being infected by various diseases.“It is our duty as young people to protect ourselves from HIV/Aids. We must respect our bodies and stop sleeping around without using protection, which also results in most of us having diseases and unwanted babies. Young people are dying because of cervical cancer due to lack of knowledge regarding their sex lives. It is our duty to go for regular check-ups and educate ourselves about sexual issues,” she said.Youth are keyShe also appealed with young people not discriminate against those who are living with HIV/Aids as it derails the fight against the virus.“No one chose to be HIV positive, hence we have to support those who are already living with the virus without discriminating them as they are people like us,” she said.Gladys Matshomo, an official from the Vhembe district Department of Health said that the youth are key to the fight against the spread of HIV/Aids.“HIV is here to stay if we don’t fight against it.

Zimond said this would help in preventing the spread of the disease in the country’s prisons.   The call by Zimond came just less than a year after Health Minister David Parirenyatwa told the state-owned Herald newspaper that homosexuality contributed to an increased HIV prevalence in prisons. Parirenyatwa claimed that the prevalence of HIV and Aids showed that people were jailed while already infected or that there was ""rampant"" homosexuality behind bars.  Mandatory HIV/Aids testing ""The rise of HIV prevalence in prisons shows that it is either these prisoners are infected already before they get into prison and if not then it means homosexuality is rampant in prisons,"" Parirenyatwa was quoted as saying at the time.

The Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ) said, although they welcomed Parirenyatwa's attitude towards opening a debate on homosexuality, the group believed that the issue of HIV and Aids in prisons had nothing to do with homosexuality, said the report.

Vuwani ARV shortage not due to unrest,The Limpopo health department says the shortage of antiretroviral medicine in Vuwani clinics is related to a national supply problem rather than violence in the area.,News24.com,2016-07-02T07:30:00.000Z,"The Limpopo health department says the shortage of antiretroviral medicine in Vuwani clinics is related to a national supply problem rather than violence in the area.Since the start of demarcation protests in the Vuwani area of Vhembe, residents especially in the Mashau village, have reported that they have been unable to receive their ARVs. Clinic staff told them that they had not received stock due to the protests in the area, as all the roads were barricaded.However, Thabiso Teffo, spokesperson for Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phopi Ramathuba, said this was not true. “I can confirm with you that no shortage of medicine, namely ARVs, was reported due to the unrest in the area,” said Teffo.“The only challenge which we are having is the shortage of the Lamivudine 300mg, but it is not caused by the protests in area; it is a national problem which we are currently experiencing at the moment.“Even though we are currently experiencing shortages when it comes to the supply of Lamivudine, we are currently prescribing a combination of Tenovir and Lamivudine to all our patients,” he added “I can assure you that all our facilities have the fixed-dose combination ARVs,” said, Teffo. Over 85 percent of patients are on FDC ARVs.Over the past months, the Mashau clinic has come under attack from the local residents for poor service delivery, shortage of ambulances and medications.Teffo said that the department is investigating the matter: “We are currently investigating all the claims which had been brought to our attention, because as a department we value the health of all our people who receive their medications at all our facilities,” he said.Earlier attempts to get comment from Limpopo health department spokesperson Derick Kganyago failed. – Health-e News. http://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/Management-of-HIV-AIDS/limpopo-arv-shortage-not-due-to-unrest-20160701","['medicine', 'national', 'unrest', 'problem', 'vuwani', 'related', 'shortage', 'violence', 'arv', 'supply', 'limpopo', 'health']",The Limpopo health department says the shortage of antiretroviral medicine in Vuwani clinics is related to a national supply problem rather than violence in the area.
‘Trusted’ man rapes four-year-old girl!,"A BROKEN-hearted mum has learned a terrible lesson: when it comes to your children, do not trust anybody!",Zimbili Vilakazi,2015-07-14T03:00:00.000Z,"A BROKEN-hearted mum has learned a terrible lesson: when it comes to your children, do not trust anybody! Her four-year-old daughter was allegedly raped by her fellow tenant in their cottage in Red Hill, Durban on Friday. The suspect allegedly lured the girl to his room with a promise of sweets while her 44-year-old father was fast asleep. The father woke up with a shock when the child started screaming. He went to investigate, but when the suspect heard the door opening he ran away. “I saw my child lying half-naked on the floor, crying,” said the dad.  “I took her to the clinic and the doctor confirmed she had been raped.” The father then went in search of the suspect and found him in the bushes, before calling the cops. The child’s mother said she had trusted the suspect. “I never thought he could do something like this. He used to call my daughter and give her sweets. I thought he loved her,” said the mum.  She said what was even worse was that the suspect was HIV-positive. “The suspect’s sugar mama, who left him a few weeks ago, told us he was on ARVs. I phoned her to tell her what had happened. She told me to rush my daughter to hospital so they could give her  anti-HIV medication,” said the mother. Major Thulani Zwane said a case of rape was opened at the Greenwood Park cop shop and was handed to Inanda cops for investigation. “A man (43) was arrested and appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court last week.

Teenagers told to avoid sugar daddies!,POLITICAL leaders attended events across Mzansi yesterday for World Aids Day.,"Simon Nare, Kamogelo Muvhenzhe, Dan Mdluli and Doreen Mokgolo",2015-12-02T10:26:49.000Z,"POLITICAL leaders attended events across Mzansi yesterday for World Aids Day.  Speaking in Port Shepstone, KZN deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa warned against destructive behaviour which contributed to the spread of the disease. He warned teenagers to stay away from sugar daddies. He promised to launch a programme to educate girls about the dangers of sleeping with older men for money and gifts. Ramaphosa called on sugar daddies to stop molesting Mzansi’s children. “We know HIV doesn’t discriminate in who it affects but it thrives on ignorance, poverty and unequal gender relations,” he said.  “It also thrives on destructive behaviour like the abuse of alcohol and drugs and unsafe sex.”  The Treatment Action Campaign said the number of people dying from Aids had gone down but new infections remained at a crisis level. The organisation said new infections were at around 1 000 a day.  Around 6,8 million people in South Africa are now living with HIV. And with the current medicine available all these people will require treatment for the rest of their lives,” the organisation said.They also said a number of provincial healthcare systems were in a state of crisis.  Gauteng MEC for health Qedani Mahlangu was at the Tshwane Events Centre for the day. She said there was an increase of new infections in young girls.  They are more worried about falling pregnant than contracting the virus,” she said. Socialite Somizi Mhlongo, who attended the event, said he has been affected by the virus. “I have lost an ex-boyfriend and a colleague to Aids. I fought for their lives but they could not make it,” he said.  Gay activist Brian Molefe said people needed to stop discriminating against those infected with HIV. In Limpopo premier Stanley Mathabatha told people gathered in Tshikanoshi Village, near Marble Hall that all five of the province’s districts were among the lowest HIV rates in the country.He also told women to stop using condoms as hair bands.","['village', 'stanley', 'daddies', 'told', 'tshikanoshi', 'sugar', 'teenagers', 'provinces', 'stop', 'using', 'rates', 'women', 'avoid', 'premier']","Gay activist Brian Molefe said people needed to stop discriminating against those infected with HIV.

WATCH: PREACHER LASHES TSOTSI PASTORS!,HE STANDS near the mall and seems like a very inspired and angry pastor.,Zamokuhle Mdluli,2018-05-25T10:25:20.000Z,"HE STANDS near the mall and seems like a very inspired and angry pastor. He may not even be a pastor at all, but nobody seems to care. THE PUBLIC LOVE THE WAY HE LASHES OUT AT TSOTSI PASTORS! The video of the mysterious pastor on the streets of Tembisa, Gauteng, hit social media with a bang.While pastors in the area are unhappy with the man the people have named “The Lashing Pastor”, people are enjoying his message, on the streets and on the internet.Among the things he preaches are sermons against pastors who claim to cure Aids.“There is no way water will heal you of HIV. Do not listen to people who come to you and say they were diagnosed but after using the pastor’s holy water, they were cured,” he says on the Facebook video in Zulu.He said it was a lie for people to say they drank holy water and all their problems with their partners disappeared.“We have distanced ourselves from God and placed our trust in fake pastors,” he said.He said: “Girls buy T-shirts belonging to the church, but still they perform adultery.“The boys even lift it up to do what they want to do while she is wearing it.”He even lambasted those who hold onto TVs to get blessings.“What happens if electricity goes off while they are still receiving? Does that mean Jesus has also left?” he askedHe said all Jesus wanted was a person’s heart.“But today when people want God, they look for him in holy waters. God is not a Russian, he doesn’t stay in oil,” he said.Daily Sun’s efforts to locate the pastor were fruitless.It is not known yet when the video was taken, but it was near the Tembisa Mall.While the people seem to love him, pastors have shaken their heads in disbelief.“This is not a pastor from this area. He may not even be a pastor by profession judging by the language he uses,” said Pastor David Masondo from Tembisa.Dr Patrick Molotsi, from Tembisa’s Transformation Forum, which monitors all pastors in the area, said: “There are children in the presence of that pastor. We do not approve of the way he speaks.”But social media users had this to say:Mongezi Mangena said: “Well, if you excuse the tone, he is actually making a lot of sense.”Aubrey Mahlase said: “The pastor is 100% on point, but he is also talented in comedy.”Kenneth Mathebula said he loves him.Ezekiel Mkhwanazi said: ‘To the point. Good pastor. Tired of these crooks.”Sylvester Mahlangu: “We need more pastors like him.”WATCH VIDEO BELOW:","['water', 'god', 'watch', 'tsotsi', 'tembisa', 'way', 'preacher', 'area', 'video', 'pastors', 'pastor', 'streets', 'holy', 'lashes']","THE PUBLIC LOVE THE WAY HE LASHES OUT AT TSOTSI PASTORS!

Anna told Daily Sun: “At the time when I was diagnosed, people would not eat with you, touch you, or shake your hand. “It was hard on HIV-positive people.” She said counselling helped her to deal with her situation and she decided to lead a healthy lifestyle. She disclosed after her husband died in 2013. “I decided to make it my mission to educate people about the disease,” she said. She invited her neighbours and told them about her disease. “I also volunteered at local clinics to counsel newly diagnosed people,” she said. Anna is well known for distributing condoms. “I work as an HIV/Aids counsellor for the City of Tshwane,” she said. “Although I’m paid in kind the opportunity has helped me reach out to many people.” A lot of young people were dismissive of her message.

This means that it is likely that the infecting blessers are not treated and have not entered the healthcare system.Right to Care is calling on South African health workers to use strategies that focus on people at risk as well as blessers who are driving the high HIV infection rates up among young women.While they cannot isolate blessers – also called players, plyers and sugar daddies – from the public, it is important that they are tested and learn their HIV status.She said blessers enter into sexual relationships with girls by offering money, cellphones, airtime, clothes and other luxuries. The blessers, who are often married, make an already massive healthcare problem worse.”Right to Care programmes work to reach men who may be blessers but she said the power play of money and poverty also means young women are forced to consent to unprotected sex to be able to afford even basic items.The HIV problem is the most immediate but there is also the concern of unwanted pregnancies.Manjekana-Dyeshana said that blessers alone were not the problem, but a symptom. The problem is that many younh people lacked a decent education and facilities. “We are pushing for youth-friendly facilities and services – healthcare facilities that people can enter without being judged by the nursing staff and older patients.”","['end', 'blesser', 'need', 'problem', 'blessers', 'hiv', 'sex', 'spread', 'young', 'men', 'toxic', 'services', 'numbers', 'healthcare', 'health']","THE numbers of people with HIV/Aids will never drop as long as there are people who recklessly spread the virus.

And they answered her prayers. In a dream they showed her the cure did not lie in medicine, but in behaviour! The 51-year-old sangoma from Thembalethu, near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga said she knew immediately what she had to do.  She started the Abstain Virgin Girls Group to educate girls about abstaining, the dangers of HIV/Aids, teen pregnancy, drugs and alcohol. That was back in 2011 and now the group boasts 15 000 members!  Last year she received a certificate of appreciation from Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza and MEC Norah Mahlangu-Mabena. Recently she got a trophy, certificate and cheque from Nkangala mayor Thomas Ngwenya. “It was not easy for me to start the group alone and without a cent.  “People with HIV used to come to me looking for treatment. I couldn’t help them.  “I asked my ancestors to help find a cure for this disease, but they showed the cure did not lie in medicine and herbs, but changing lifestyles.  “Young girls and boys have to abstain from sex. They must stay away from drugs and alcohol.” Thuthukile told Daily Sun since the Indoni My Pride My Heritage competitions started, she has sent young Ndebele girls and boys to compete. She explained that those in matric who were virgins were given bursaries to study.","['help', 'aids', 'medicine', 'warrior', 'cure', 'sangoma', 'started', 'showed', 'group', 'mpumalanga', 'girls', 'lie']","SANGOMA Thuthukile Kabini begged her ancestors to help her be the first traditional healer to find a cure for Aids.

BLESSER BOMBSHELL!,TEENAGE girls are more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group!.,Tebogo Mokwena,2016-07-15T04:30:00.000Z,"TEENAGE girls are more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group! Researchers have yet to find out why girls are still more vulnerable to HIV than boys. However, it is believed young girls tend to have sex very early – and with older men.Last month, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, chairman of the South African National Aids Council, called on sugar daddies and blessers to stop dating young girls. According to the 2012 South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behaviour Survey, more needs to be done to challenge society’s acceptance of sugar daddy and blessers’ relationships, as they are associated with financial gain. “It is necessary to ensure young women are empowered and have access to education and employment to break the cycle of poverty,” read the survey. Researcher Sintha Chiumia said the survey tested more than 3 000 teenagers between the ages on 15 and 19 for HIV.It was discovered that 5,6% of the young girls were estimated to be HIV-positive, compared with 0,7% of boys in the same age group. Professor Olive Shisana, deputy chairwoman of the International Aids Conference, told Africa Check, a non-profit organisation that promotes accuracy in public debate and the media, that the higher prevalence among 15 to 19-year-old girls is the result of young girls having sex at an earlier age than boys in the same age group.She said: “The tendency in South Africa is for young women to have sex with men at least five years older, whose chances of being HIV-positive are higher. “One can see it in the fact that HIV prevalence among men aged between 20 and 24 was an estimated 5,1%, which was closer to the prevalence among the girls aged between 15 and 19.”Although the results of the research will be released at the International Aids Conference next week, research director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, Professor Sinead Delany-Moretlwe, told Africa Check that young girls are affected by immature genital tracts.","['blesser', 'aids', 'hivpositive', 'bombshell', 'hiv', 'south', 'sex', 'age', 'young', 'boys', 'girls', 'prevalence']","TEENAGE girls are more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group!

TB: ACT NOW TO STAY HEALTHY,,Sun Reporter,2018-05-31T11:30:01.000Z,"DO you know what the top 10 causes of death are in Mzansi?You may be surprised to learn that tuberculosis (TB)comes in at number one, followed by diabetes at number two, with HIV coming inat number five.This is not just a serious problem for South Africa: 25%of the world’s population are infected by TB bacteria.  Many people do not get the care they need,which is why the disease continues to spread.South Africa has adopted the international “90-90-90” targetsfor combating HIV and TB. This means that if 90% (nine out of 10) of people withHIV and TB know their status, get treated and stay on treatment, this will helpprevent the spread of the diseases and keep people healthy.“TB is a highly infectious disease but it is alsopreventable and can be cured,” says Roger Tevan, the eThekwini DistrictCo-ordinator for Health Systems Trust’s SA SURE Plus Project. “The main thingis to know the signs of TB and to get help early.  Men in particular are not always proactive inlooking after their own health. We must not be in denial. We need to make surethat we are keeping our families, colleagues and community healthy.”Tevan stresses that it is very important for workers tobe tested for TB because some of the occupational risks they face can affecttheir immune response – such as exposure to chemical fumes. Some factories arenot ventilated properly or don’t get direct sunlight. This can lead to the TBbacteria spreading among colleagues.“It can be difficult for people working in factories toget to the clinic,” says Tevan. “By the time they get home, the clinics areclosed.”“TB spreads easily,” warns Tevan, “so an infected persongetting into a crowded taxi with closed windows is the ideal place for thebacteria to spread. This means that infected people could also get anopportunistic infection because their immunity is low.”Some people may spread the bacteria that causes TB evenif they don’t display symptoms themselves.Tevan also offers some simple tips to prevent the spreadof TB:- Cover your mouth with a tissue if you cough or sneeze.- Wash your hands after sneezing or coughing.- Keep rooms well ventilated – fresh air helps todisperse TB bacteria.Some symptoms show that you should be tested for TB, suchas coughing for longer than one month, feeling feverish, having night sweats,struggling to breathe, losing appetite, and feeling very weak.“If you have any of these symptoms, you should go to yournearest clinic. Once you have been tested and have started treatment, it isvery important that you take your medicine properly because otherwise thesedrugs can stop working,” says Tevan.

DON’T RELY ON BLESSERS!,"Actor, playwright and director  Paul Rapetsoa has damned blessers and  blessees.",,None,"Actor, playwright and director Paul Rapetsoa has damned blessers and blessees.He said they both face the danger of being affected by sexually transmitted diseases and spreading them to their partners.Paul’s play Blessers Must Fall, which was first shown at the Soweto Theatre last year, was staged at the Lutheran Church at Ster Park in Polokwane, Limpopo, on Sunday.He told SunBuzz he’s on a mission to educate the youth.“We can’t just look away when we see our children throwing themselves at men with money just to get what they want.”He said young girls want to use blessers as elevators to success instead of working hard to create better futures.“If I only condemn the blessers, the young girls will think what they’re doing is good when it’s not,” said the playwright.The congregation loved the play and the lessons it taught them.The play centres around Gregory, a church member and teacher. Gregory was a blesser which eventually led to him being infected with HIV.“The play outlines the social consequences of having a blesser. We look at teenage pregnancy, HIV/Aids, poverty, sexual abuse and other issues that affect the youth today.”In the play, Reverend Medupi goes to a local clinic to pray for the sick. He is shocked to see Gregory coming out of a nurse’s room with his HIV treatment.The reverend was angry with Gregory because he knew he had been sleeping around and he feared he had made all the women he was with sick.Medupi refused to pray for Gregory and called him a dog.“I can’t pray for this one. Even if you die I will never come to your funeral because I don’t bury dogs. You slept with almost every woman at your school and girls in our church.“The painful part is that you even impregnated Cynthia, the woman I wanted to marry,” said the angry reverend.Rapetsoa said people can learn from the play. “I hope it teaches our communities about morals.

SOMIZI IS BIGGER THAN THE DISEASE!,Somizi on his brand new book.,The Juice/Channel24,2017-06-25T11:27:43.000Z,"""There I was, my life was perfect in the eyes of everyone, but inside I was dying. How was I going to deal with this; is there a cure for it? There is no cure for it. Do I take treatment and survive it or am I going to die within six months?” writes socialite Somizi Mhlongo in his memoir, Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit.He went on an emotional roller coaster after a doctor, giving him the results of medical tests, told him that all was clear, except for one terminal disease.""To this day I haven’t had the courage or the need to say which one it is between cancer, HIV and diabetes,"" Mhlongo (44) says.Everyone around him said he only had a month to live, but God had other plans for him, he says.Even though he has been living with the terminal disease for some time, Mhlongo is still positive about life and hasn’t allowed it to dampen his spirits. He says writing the emotional book didn’t weigh heavily on him, but he wonders whether someone not as strong as he is would manage.“I can’t believe that to this day I’ve pulled through. Everybody had given up. Everyone was saying ‘lona [this one] he’s got a month to live’,” Mhlongo told City Press this week ahead of the launch of his memoir on Wednesday. His book will also be available at Exclusive Books stores on Wednesday.“If I managed to survive this, nothing is going to be hard for me anymore in this world,” he says.He first thought about writing a tell-all book about six years ago when everything around him came crashing down. That, along with musician and actor Brian Temba’s hit single, Dominoes, inspired the book’s title. Mhlongo says he felt it was the perfect title to sum up his life’s journey.“Since I was born I’ve been breaking down walls, hurdles and obstacles ... they fall like dominoes. My story is that of walls falling like dominoes,” he says.Mhlongo recalls feeling very ill a few years ago and deciding to go for a medical check-up “just to be aware of what was going on” with his health.Six months after he was diagnosed, he decided to cultivate a positive mind-set and did some research on the disease.He also decided to strive to balance his life as an entertainer and the reality of his medical condition. “Showbiz life was great but inside I was dying,” he says.Mhlongo says he put on a brave face in public spaces to mask what he was going through in private. Later, he decided to reveal his status to fellow dancer Mapule Sesedinyane who encouraged him to get treatment. The second person he told was his partner at the time, Tom, who became a great support system.Mhlongo told City Press that he did not write the book to get pity from the public or for fame.“I am 150% sure that [many people] are going through the same [experience] somewhere, but I can be the voice that brings in some light into somebody’s life.”He says in the process of adjusting and understanding the implications of the disease, there were good and bad days.“The were days I did not want the sun to rise. I was only looking forward to the evening because at night we are all the same. It’s the end of the day for everyone. But during the day, people that are doing well are visible,” he reckons.As if his life was not complicated enough, Mhlongo reveals in the book that his world crumbled further when he was accused of sexually assaulting a man. He maintains his innocence, arguing to this day that he wouldn’t do such a thing.“I struggled so much [to handle the matter] that I became depressed and I decided to take antidepressants. However, I took them for one day and I didn’t like the after-effects.“They made me feel like everything was okay when the reality was contrary. I had to face my problems head on. I stopped drinking and having casual sex. It was tough. I needed some spiritual guidance and upliftment. The only way was prayer,” he writes.He found peace when he started going to Rhema Bible Church, where he met kwaito group TKZee member Kabelo Mabalane, who was a recovering drug addict.He says the alleged sexual assault accusations almost ruined his career. Entertainment jobs dried up and life got increasingly tough.“I had a BMW Z4, which was also in arrears and the bank had called so many times I couldn’t take it anymore. The next thing, a knock on my door, they’d come to repossess the car. I took everything out of the car, and they took it and left,” he writes.“I was driving the big [Land Rover] Discovery and I couldn’t afford it. I was late with payments, my bond was in arrears, the banks were calling left, right and centre.“I didn’t have a cent to my name. I could have easily gone back to my mother’s house, but I was like, ‘no Somizi, soldier on, soldier on’, so I soldiered on,” he recalls.The book also shares details of his experiences and friendship with the late Brenda Fassie, who he says offered him drugs.“Everyone knew that Brenda smoked dagga and was into drugs. At some point, she offered me drugs.“I don’t know where I got it from, but I’ve always had a backbone,” he states.He is adamant that he has never touched drugs in his life, even though he has always been surrounded by users.He also spoke about how Mandoza and Bricks did cocaine in his presence.“I remember them fixing a portion for me to smoke. I took it and I threw it on the floor of the car without them seeing me. Then suddenly there were cops behind us.”Asked how he feels about the book, Mhlongo said he was afraid to read it because he felt it would take him back to the troubled episodes of his past life.He maintains that he doesn’t have any regrets about his life’s journey.“I know who my target market is, if anyone feels otherwise about this, they are entitled to do so.“This book is about hope, faith and seeing the light in the darkest moments. I believe we are all destined to succeed in life and to be happy. It’s how we handle the tough times that separate us from the rest,” he said.http://www.channel24.co.za/The-Juice/News/somizis-bigger-than-the-disease-20170625-2","['decided', 'book', 'life', 'medical', 'bigger', 'told', 'day', 'going', 'disease', 'mhlongo', 'somizi', 'took', 'dominoes']","Do I take treatment and survive it or am I going to die within six months?” writes socialite Somizi Mhlongo in his memoir, Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit.

INSECURE'S JAY ELLIS LOVES MZANSI!,"Breakout star of the hit HBO series, Insecure, Jay Ellis says he is completely enthralled with South Africa.",Mokgethwa Masemola,2017-11-28T13:20:24.000Z,"Breakout star of the hit HBO series, Insecure, Jay Ellis says he is completely enthralled with South Africa.The actor and HIV/AIDS activist was in recently in the country and told the Daily Sun about how incredible he finds our country.Jay has been in SA for three months shooting a SONY movie called The Maze, a psychological thriller set to be released sometime in 2018.During his stay here, Jay has called Cape Town home.But this isn’t the first time, the sexy actor has been in Mzansi. Two years ago, Jay spent about two weeks in Johannesburg and he says that when he found out that The Maze would be shot in Cape Town, he was completely on board.“One of the reasons I took this job was because I got to come back to SA. I was here two years ago, but just in Johannesburg for about 10 days and fell in love. When I got the opportunity to do this movie and found out it was shooting here, I wanted to see more of the country,” he told the Daily Sun.Although the plot in the movie is set in the USA, it is entirely shot in Cape Town.“We filmed at UCT, we filmed at the Convention Centre, we filmed at Cape Town studios and a couple of other places. We’ve explored quite a bit,” said Jay.During his stay here, Jay has been exploring Cape Town, going up Table Mountain more times than he can count, visiting the beach, experiencing the art and culture and of course, sampling the wine.“There is an overwhelming feeling of peace and happiness that I get being here, especially being down by the water, being by the mountains. I’ve been up table mountain probably as much as people who work there and that view is breath-taking, every single time it hits me in a different way. It is this wonder that strikes me every single time. The other thing is that there is this sense of love here, and open arms, and happiness that I have experienced here and that has been transformative for sure,” he said.Jay says that the one thing which has completely taken him aback is the explosive art scene that people in his part of the world never get to hear about.Our music, performing arts, spoken word and traditional mediums of art (television, film and writing) have completely re-shaped Jay’s perspective on the world.“It’s been amazing. I will take it home with me, it will inform my world as I go home, but it is stuff that I wish that America and the world will one day be able to witness,” said Jay.Television bad boy, Jay Ellis.Photo: Getty Images If you’ve never heard of Jay, that’s because he keeps a very low profile, taking pleasure in having as much time to himself as possible.“The few moments of anonymity that I get to have are so precious. So when I can be away from the spotlight, I appreciate it. It lets get to spend time with my parents and my loved ones, friends and family, it’s important,” he said.But, no amount of keeping a low profile can help him escape the mega success of Insecure and subsequently, the fame that now follows all of its actors.On the show, Jay plays Lawrence, an app developer who, in the beginning plays boyfriend to Issa Rae, creator of the show who plays a character by the same name.Issa and Lawrence break up early on in the show and things take a very interesting turn.The show has been hailed as a successful portrayal of the lived experiences of black people; that they are also real, they experience the same emotions as everyone else, they have the same heartaches, successes and failures, the same insecurities.“What Insecure has done is that it has normalized a black experience, and it has put a group of people, a slice of life, in front of millions of people around the world, of multiple skin colours. You get to see these characters in their best, in their worst, in their happiness, their sadness, success and failures, insecurities and you get to relate to them,” says Jay.","['loves', 'world', 'mzansi', 'town', 'movie', 'jay', 'completely', 'ellis', 'happiness', 'insecures', 'plays', 'insecure', 'cape', 'filmed']","Breakout star of the hit HBO series, Insecure, Jay Ellis says he is completely enthralled with South Africa.

MOTSOALEDI BLAMES LACK OF SEX EDUCATION!,"Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said on Tuesday he was not surprised by the results of a national HIV survey, lamenting the lack of sexual and reproductive education at schools.",,2018-07-18T11:41:47.000Z,"Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said on Tuesday he was not surprised by the results of a national HIV survey, lamenting the lack of sexual and reproductive education at schools.The South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey of 2017 showed that while there has been a significant decline in South Africa’s HIV infection rate, young people are still at risk.The survey found that there were an estimated 231 100 new infections in 2017, with infections among young people having risen by 7.9% – with females at three-times higher risk than their male counterparts.Rejected by parentsMotsoaledi recalled how he tried to introduce sexual and reproductive education at schools several years ago, only to have the idea vehemently rejected by parents and unions.He said they were only allowed to do immunisation, eye testing and alcohol and drug campaigns.“They said no sexual and reproductive rights education, saying that children are too young for that. I want to tell parents that kids these days know way too much. Facts are out there pointing to this,” he said, adding that social media was a contributing factor leading children to experiment.The results of the survey were revealed in Pretoria – this is the fifth survey 2002. It is a population-based cross sectional survey of households in South Africa conducted between January and December 2017. Over 33 000 people were interviewed and almost 24 000 agreed to be tested for HIV.Progress made with ART The study further revealed that in 2017 there were 7.9 million people living with HIV in South Africa and over 60% or an estimated 4.4 million people were on antiretroviral treatment (ART).It was also found that the viral suppression was 87.3% among people living with HIV, with females generally being more likely to be virally suppressed than males among those aged between 15 and 64 years.“This suggests that the progress is being made in increasing ART coverage. But more still needs to be done,” said Dr Sizulu Moyo of the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) which conducted the survey. Furthermore, although viral suppression is high among those on ART, not everyone who is living with HIV is on treatment, and subsequently only 62.3% of all people living with HIV, irrespective of treatment, were found to be virally suppressed.The study also found that HIV prevalence peaked at 35 to 39 years of age for females and 45 to 49 years of age for males. Kwa-Zulu Natal was found to be the leading province in HIV prevalence, followed by the Free State and the Eastern Cape. The three least affected provinces were Limpopo, Northern Cape and Western Cape.We need to do moreIt was found that the country had made some progress in addressing the HIV epidemic. In terms of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, the study found that 85% of people living with HIV have tested for the virus and know their positive status, with 71% of this sub-group on ART, and 86% of those on ART being virally suppressed.“This shows that the country has made a significant progress towards reaching the 90-90-90 targets,” said Dr Edmore Marinda of the Research Use and Impact Assessment (RIA) Unit in the HSRC.Medical male circumcision was lauded as one of the best interventions to reduce HIV among males. The increase in the number of men who are medically circumcised rose from 18.6% in 2012 to 30.8% in 2017.“Although encouraging, this finding highlights a need to continue promoting and creating a demand for voluntary medical male circumcision with an immediate target among males in the 15-to-34 year old age group,” said Professor Leickness Simbayi, the overall principal investigator.

SA BABIES NEED MORE EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING,In the past 20 years there has been a massive global push for mothers to exclusively breastfeed their newborns for the first six months of their lives.,Parent24.com,2018-08-02T00:00:10.000Z,"In the past 20 years there has been a massive global push for mothers to exclusively breastfeed their newborns for the first six months of their lives. The science suggests this is a good way to improve their children’s later development.  There has also been a large body of research on the effects of formula milk, and other replacement foods, on the health of babies during their first six months. A great deal shows that they have negative effects.Early 2000s: 90% of SA babies were mixed fedBut for many years HIV positive mothers were advised to either exclusively breastfeed their babies, or only feed them formula. They could choose which they preferred – but not a mixture of the two. This was very confusing for many mothers. Many fell back on mixed feeding. They started using both approaches as the same time – sometimes breastfeeding their babies, sometimes using commercial formula or other replacement liquids and foods. In South Africa this practise was very common – close to 90% of the country’s babies were mixed fed in the early 2000s. 2016: 32% of SA babies were breastfedIn 2010 this changed. The World Health Organisation took a stand and recommended that governments should make a choice between the two options. They either had to encourage HIV positive mothers to exclusively breastfeed or to exclusively formula feed. They shouldn’t do both.These guidelines prompted South Africa to end its free formula programme in public facilities. Instead, it promoted exclusive breastfeeding for all mothers. This meant that frontline health workers, including nurses and clinic staff, had to change the way they counselled mothers about feeding practices.Seven years after the new policy was introduced we wanted to find out how well frontline workers had adjusted. Did they understand the new policy and its purpose? And did it make a difference to breastfeeding rates? Our findings were surprising. When it came to HIV-positive mothers, the frontline workers encouraged them to breastfeed their babies exclusively. But when it came to HIV-negative mothers, the workers didn’t highlight the importance of exclusive breastfeeding, nor did they discourage mothers from mixed feeding. Our study suggests that South Africa could improve exclusive breastfeeding rates. The rate has improved in recent years – by 2016 32% of mothers were exclusively breastfeeding their babies. But there’s still a great deal of room for improvement. Kenya, for example, has achieved a rate of over 60%. The onus is with the South African government to engage health workers about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for babies born to HIV positive as well as HIV negative mothers. They need to provide clear communication tools and counselling skills that can help health workers address the barriers mothers face.Reliant on adviceStudies have shown that new mothers rely heavily on the advice they get from health workers about infant feeding. Mothers who get confusing or misleading advice from health workers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed, or to do so for a shorter time. On the other hand, those who receive clear, positive messages about exclusive breastfeeding from their health workers are more likely to breastfeed.  That’s why our study focused on health workers. We interviewed frontline health workers from four community health clinics in Soweto. They included nurses, ward-based outreach team members and staff seconded from non-governmental organisations. Each of them had counselled mothers about baby feeding before and after the policy change.Few health workers understood the scientific rationale of the policy to promote exclusive breastfeeding. Many were under the impression that the formula programme had been stopped due to costs and most hadn’t been trained on the new policy. The health workers believed that breastmilk was best for babies and were able to rattle off the nutritional benefits and other advantages such as allowing the mother and the baby to bond and the fact that it was cheaper. But there were differences in the way they responded to HIV-positive and -negative mothers. They advised all mothers to breastfeed their babies. But they spent more time educating HIV-positive mothers about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding rather than HIV-negative mothers. The subtext was that mixed feeding was mostly a HIV-related risk. When they spoke to HIV-negative mothers they spent more time warning them about HIV and advising them how to protect themselves. They did not emphasise the benefits of exclusively breastfeeding.What next?There are still structural barriers around exclusive breastfeeding that need attention. This includes maternity leave policies that fall short of the six month exclusive breastfeeding period, anabsence of public and workplace spaces for breastfeedingand the idea that exclusive breastfeeding is only for HIV-exposed babies. On top of this, mixed feeding remains a cultural norm in many communities. On the bright side, exclusive breastfeeding rates are increasing in South Africa and health workers have an important role to play in explaining the health and development benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for all babies. South Africa’s health department should provide health workers with updated information on the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and the risks of mixed feeding. This needs to include pre-tested materials that can be placed in public spaces like clinics. In addition, they should continuously provide interactive content on the health workers’ cellphones through platforms like NurseConnect which they could access during consultations. Health workers also need training on how to navigate between health education and counselling that empowers mothers. To get the best outcome for both mother and baby, a single directive from above is less likely to result in behaviour change than a two-way conversation about overcoming barriers.Sara Nieuwoudt, Lecturer, University of the Witwatersrand. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina pleaded with the crowd to calm down.  ""I will come and listen to your concerns, but we must let the programme continue,"" Masina said, as the crowd continued relentlessly. Masina, along with a squad of bodyguards, then marched to the stands with the volunteers. He was soon chased away by the crowd.  The mood of the crowd shifted soon after Ramaphosa started his address, when he said he and government were working towards addressing the concerns of community workers.  The crowd's boos then turned to resounding cheers as Ramaphosa explained that government was in the process of attending to the minimum wage bill proposal.  At least 2 000 people attended the event.

STICKING WITH THE ROAD TO HEALTH,"BY now, most adults know that diseases like HIV, high blood pressure and diabetes are chronic conditions that can be managed by taking medication and living a healthy lifestyle.",Sun Reporter,2018-04-19T11:30:03.000Z,"BY now, most adults know that diseases like HIV, highblood pressure and diabetes are chronic conditions that can be managed bytaking medication and living a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, it is not always as easy to stick with atreatment plan as we think it is. The clinic is sometimes far, and verycrowded, and this means that patients have to take time off work, or away fromtheir busy lives to get their chronic medication. Adherence clubshave emerged as a solution to these challenges we face. Because an adherenceclub has a trained health care worker running the club, they can also help withguidance on nutrition and side-effects, which are other barriers to notsticking with a dedicated treatment plan.Professional Nurse Philiswa Matiso is aptly named – hername means “healer” in isiXhosa. She works for Sakhimpilo Home Community-basedCare Project, based in Tsolo in the rural Eastern Cape, which runs adherenceclubs for people on chronic medication.Professional Nurse Philiswa Matiso from Sakhimpilo Home Community-based Care Project in the rural Eastern Cape. Photo by James Oatway“Many people live far from clinics so cannot always comeand fetch their chronic medication. Some get confused about their medicine,while others are even in denial to themselves. Our job is to ensure that allpatients get their chronic medicine, that they take it properly and that theyhave someone to speak to about any other health issues.”The clubs are open to people who have been stable for ayear on chronic medication such as antiretroviral therapy or blood pressuretreatment. Members of the club only need to go back to the clinic twice  a year for a physical check-up and for theirtreatment to be assessed. The programme is a targeted approach to reduce waitingtimes at clinics and to make sure that nurses have time to give quality care topatients. “Instead of people sitting in queues for hours, spendingmoney on transport and sometimes having to miss work to attend the clinicsimply to get their medicine, the clubs are a space for people to pop in tocollect their medication, to engage with a qualified health worker and to bequickly referred for any other illnesses arising,” says Malibongwe Daweti,Community Co-ordinator for Health Systems Trust.For the elderly, the clubs can literally be a lifesaver.“Sometimes we used to spend the whole day sitting in the clinic to get ourmedication,” says Mhlakulo Sondaba (65). “Now I collect it at the adherenceclub, or they deliver it to me if I am not well enough to attend. The clubhelps to motivate me to take my medicine every day at the right time, and now Ihave more time to work in my garden.”Mhlakulo Sondaba says a healthy lifestyle is just an important as medicine. Photo by James OatwayHer garden is not just her hobby but her livelihood too.“We don’t just have to take our treatment; we must take care of our own health.Many problems are coming from our food, things like fast food, frozen chickenand processed meat make us sick. I want everyone to grow vegetables so theyknow how veggies without chemicals taste.” Tobias Sibuta (63) credits the Sakhimpilo team withkeeping him fit and healthy. “There is never a time we haven’t received ourmedicine, even when the bridge is under water,” he says. “It is such a long wayto the clinic but now we don’t have to go every month. We only go to getchecked and get a new prescription.” The club meets every two months, and onceevery six months the clients return to the clinic to check their blood pressureor for viral load tests and to get a new script.People with TB symptoms cannot attend adherence clubsbecause the disease is highly contagious, especially for those with weakenedimmune systems. However, many people with HIV also develop TB, so the clubs arethe perfect place to identify TB patients and to ensure that they are testedand treated. The Sakhimpilo staff also trace family and contacts of thepatients identified with TB and refer them to the clinic for testing andtreatment if necessary.  Adherence clubs are giving people the power to beresponsible for their own health and wellbeing. “This community care approachto health means that each of us must take responsibility and ensure that we doeverything we can to stay fit and healthy,” says Matiso. “I tell everyone inthe club ‘you are not sick, you just have a manageable condition’.” You cantake control of your health by sticking with it.For moreinformation go to: http://www.hst.org.za/publications/HST%20Publications/Healthy%20me%20healthy%20us_WEB%20VERSION.pdf","['medicine', 'sticking', 'care', 'tb', 'chronic', 'medication', 'clubs', 'clinic', 'road', 'treatment', 'club', 'health']","Because an adherence club has a trained health care worker running the club, they can also help with guidance on nutrition and side-effects, which are other barriers to not sticking with a dedicated treatment plan.

Photo by: Portia Moyo. ON MONDAY the South African National Aids Council hosted its National Sex Workers symposium. The conference was held at Turbine Hall in Newtown, Joburg. The aim was to introduce a programme that caters to the needs of sex workers, who are more vulnerable to HIV infection than most people. Special prevention and treatment interventions suited to their particular needs and circumstances are necessary.  Deputy minister of social development Hendrietta Bogapane-Zulu said: “The aim of the programme is to reduce the transmission of HIV to sex workers and their clients.”  She added that it also aims to ensure good access to social services and healthcare for sex workers, and to tackle human rights issues such as abuse that make them vulnerable to HIV infection. The programme was introduced as a council flagship project and of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and malaria.  It was financed by a grant of about R100 million from the Global Fund to Fight Aids. Council CEO Dr Fareed Abdullah said: “It not only adresses prevention of HIV and appropriate healthcare for those living with HIV, it also tackles the difficult question of access to justice for sex workers.” He said the introduction of a national HIV programme for sex workers finally plugs a gaping hole in the country’s response to the epidemic. Abdullah said about 60% of Mzansi’s estimated 150 000 sex workers are HIV-positive. “How can you talk about HIV prevention and not talk about sex work, knowing HIV transmission involves sex? “Sex workers, their non-commercial partners and their clients account for between six and 11% of all new infections in South Africa.” He said general HIV services did not meet the special needs of sex workers. “Their work exposes them to a hugely increased risk of getting infected. It is often dangerous and lonely and carries a heavy social stigma as it is illegal.” Abdullah said the programme would be initiated through a network of NGOs under the leadership of the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy task force. Kholi Buthelezi, the national co-ordinator for the national sex worker movement Sisonke said: “Our movement was formed in 2003. We were tired of being mistreated.” She said sex workers have a real stake in the planning and running of the programme.  “It is up to us to continue to organise and raise our voices louder for the changes we need to see in the legislation and policies affecting sex workers.” Buthelezi said they were doing this to protect themselves, their health, families and their futures. “We are doing something positive to fight the HIV epidemic for the nation as a whole.”","['programme', 'magoshas', 'national', 'workers', 'work', 'safety', 'needs', 'fight', 'prevention', 'hiv', 'sex', 'tips', 'social']","ON MONDAY the South African National Aids Council hosted its National Sex Workers symposium.

KAGISO TO BE CIRCUMCISED WITH 2000 MEN!,Brothers for Life ambassador Kagiso Modupe (33) has decided to get medically circumcised and is calling on 2000 men across the country to join him.,Sun Reporter,2017-02-21T12:00:16.000Z,"Brothers for Life ambassador Kagiso Modupe (33) has decided to get medically circumcised and is calling on 2000 men across the country to join him.Modupe is well loved for starring as Mangi Nyathi on the popular TV programme Scandal.“I would like South African men to join me in a celebration of masculinity, brotherhood and good health. I’m calling on men to be circumcised with me on Saturday, 11 March 2017. There are 200 clinics involved in #ZwakalaSkeem day and it’s absolutely free,” the actor said.Kagiso is encouraging men to book for a medical circumcision by sending a ‘please call me’ to 082 808 6152 to secure a slot on #ZwakalaSkeem day at one of 150 clinics in Gauteng, KZN, Mpumpalanga and the North West. “I was motivated to have this done when I read how it can protect my wife from getting Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which causes cervical cancer.  But I’ve learnt that in a recent survey of 100 000 men, 47% do it for hygiene reasons and 38% for HIV prevention. Circumcision reduces the risk of contracting HIV by 60% as well as other sexually transmitted infections. Some men do it because it keeps the penis clean, and others because their partners prefer it, but whatever the reason, it’s the right thing to do,” said ModupeKagiso will undergo the procedure at the Katlehong North Clinic.He has invited the Mini car club, a local DJ and the Ridge Riders Motorcycle Club to be there to celebrate the men who make the choice to circumcise.His wife, Liza Modupe will also take part in the celebrations.“I want it to be a chilled fun day where you can bring your wife and your kids,” he explains.When asked why he wasn’t already circumcised, Kagiso responded that he’d considered it after high school.“A doctor told me my foreskin was too small which turned out to be nonsense. Then there were the usual issues: I was nervous about the pain, the healing period and abstaining from sex. I’ve since discussed circumcision with men who have had the procedure. They say there is more discomfort than pain. Also, painkillers are provided. You can’t have sex or masturbate for six weeks afterwards, but I’ve timed it to be totally healed by my birthday.”Kagiso’s wife, Liza comments, “What he is doing is very brave. I totally support him and appreciate his decision to protect me and do the right thing.”Dr Khumbulani Moyo, Medical Male Circumcision Manager at the USAID-funded Voluntary Male Medical Circumcision consortium says: “The public health benefits are significant. One HIV infection can be prevented for every five circumcisions performed; it also reduces the risks of cervical, anal and prostate cancer. Circumcision is one of the most common procedures performed worldwide and when performed by healthcare professionals, complications are very rare.”After the circumcision, two follow up clinic visits are needed.Patients are advised to continue using condoms when having sex, to stick to one sexual partner and to know their HIV status.Any male aged 10 - 49 and in good health, irrespective of HIV status, is eligible for free circumcision in South Africa.Those under 18 need parental consent.To book an appointment for a circumcision near you on Saturday, 11 March 2017 or any other day send a ‘please call me’ to 082 808 6152 and mention #ZwakalaSkeem.","['circumcision', 'circumcised', 'medical', 'wife', 'zwakalaskeem', 'day', 'hiv', 'sex', 'kagiso', '2000', 'performed', 'men', 'male']","Brothers for Life ambassador Kagiso Modupe (33) has decided to get medically circumcised and is calling on 2000 men across the country to join him.

MYTHS ABOUT PERIOD SEX,It’s time to clear up some of the misconceptions men have about sex during that time of the month.,Health24,2018-07-10T20:00:03.000Z,"It’s time to clear up some of the misconceptions men have about sex during that time of the month.Having sex during your partner’s menstrual period may not be your cup of tea, but then if you’ve never tried it, how would you know? There are countless religious and cultural taboos that forbid intercourse during that time of the month and you’ll have to make up your own mind about exactly how you feel about those. But there are also some pretty silly misconception and myths about period sex, especially among guys, that need to be cleared up.1. It’s grossLook, there’s no doubt that period sex has the potential of being a fair bit more messy than sex during the rest of the month, but with a little planning it’s not gross at all. A towel or an extra sheet spread on your bed will do a discreet mop-up job if necessary. Alternatively, why not do the deed in the shower or the bath tub. There’s nothing like a change of scenery to keep things interesting and any messiness is easily washed away at the turn of a tab.As another option, you partner may want to try wearing a diaphragm, or a menstrual cap shaped like one, or even a female condom all of which will capture any blood while allowing penetration. If you use a dental dam even oral sex during her period doesn’t have to freak you out – some guys actually develop a particular, erm... taste for it.2. It’s unhealthyContrary to many cultural and religious taboos, from a medical perspective, menstrual blood is no more “dirty” than other bodily fluids. Provided you practice safe sex, period sex is perfectly healthy and will not have any adverse effects on your penis or her reproductive organs.3. You can’t get AIDS or STDsThe surprisingly widespread belief that it’s impossible to contract HIV/Aids or other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), like syphilis and chlamydia, during period sex is false. Like semen, vaginal fluid and other bodily excretions, menstrual blood will contain STDs, including HIV, if the women happens to be a carrier and if you have unprotected sex with her your risk of contracting the disease from her is high. Safe sex is not negotiable, whether your doing it during her period or not, so always protect yourself by wearing a condom.4. It won’t be funRather than limiting their enjoyment, some women experience an increased sex drive during their period as a result of the surge of hormones sloshing around their bodies during that time of their cycle. Menstruation also tends to make the vagina more sensitive and perceptive to stimulation. Some women report that they have more intense and quicker orgasms during period sex. Couples frequently say that they enjoy the extra lubrication and the “earthiness” of it all.5. She can’t fall pregnantNo time of the month is 100% safe and while it’s quite unlikely, it is definitely possible for your partner to fall pregnant during her period. So unless you’re planning to become a father, make sure to practice safe sex and always remember to condomise.6. It’ll make her period worseIf you worry about prolonging her period by having sex during her time of the month, don’t. In fact, quite the opposite might be the case. Many women report that intercourse during menstruation actually helps to relieve menstrual cramps and pains. The uterus goes through muscular contractions during an orgasm and semen contains prostaglandins, the hormones that stimulate uterine contractions. In combination this tends to increase the number of contractions, allowing her body to expel menstrual blood more quickly, bringing the period to an early end.If you’re not sure about all of this, but think you might want to give it a try, why don’t you talk to your partner about it. Together you can explore whether period sex will work for you. One thing’s for sure guys: we shouldn’t be afraid of a little blood – women deal with it every month!- Health24","['myths', 'blood', 'sure', 'partner', 'menstrual', 'sex', 'period', 'safe', 'women', 'month', 'guys']","But there are also some pretty silly misconception and myths about period sex, especially among guys, that need to be cleared up.

Photo by Reuters THE educational TV show Shuga has a new home. From next week, it will be aired on e.tv.  This TV series, first aired in November 2009 on MTV Base, was created in support of the MTV Staying Alive initiative. It introduced the talents of Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o and reality show star and recording artist Valerie Kimani.  The series looks at HIV testing, condom use, gender inequality and the role multiple partnerships play in driving the HIV epidemic.  It is aimed at positively changing the behaviour of young people to improve their sexual and reproductive health.  Monde Twala, MD of e.tv’s channels divisions, said their 8.30pm weekday slot is now packed with local flavour and the show adds an interesting twist. “The issues highlighted in Shuga are similar to those faced by the youth throughout Africa.  “The young generation knows exactly what they want and what they need to do to get it, but often obstacles stand in their way.  “The show unpacks the risks and consequences of conduct, so it has a strong purpose of edutainment.  “It will be a riveting drama series,” said Twala.  The first two seasons of this moving drama are based in Nairobi, Kenya, while the third season is based in Nigeria.  Season one is a hard-hitting, three-part drama series that follows a group of cool young students whose bright lives and fabulous futures are balanced on a knife-edge due to their love of risk and danger.  It is the story of love, sex, Friday nights and the marks people leave on one another. Season two runs with the theme “Love, Sex and Money”. It offers a raw and uncut view of the lives of sexually active young Kenyans forced to face up to the consequences of their party-hard lifestyle. Based in Nigeria, season three is a story of love, betrayal, relationships and heartaches among a small group of friends.  ) Catch Shuga on e.tv (channel 194) from Tuesday, 16 June at 8.30pm","['watch', 'shuga', 'lifestyles', 'tv', 'sex', 'season', 'lives', 'love', 'young', 'drama', 'mtv', 'exposed', 'risky', 'series']","This TV series, first aired in November 2009 on MTV Base, was created in support of the MTV Staying Alive initiative.

Ofthese, 139 decided to go on ARVs. Around 60% of them were still on themedication after a year.The sex workers who tested HIV negative (351) were offeredone pill, Truvada, to take every day to protect them from the virus. 219 womenaccepted the offer.But a year later, only 49 women were still taking Truvada –although none of those still on the pills had contracted HIV.“The final retention rate was lower than we would like.However, there were no seroconversions among those women who stayed on the PrEParm,” said Robyn Eakle, a senior researcher from the Wits Reproductive Healthand HIV Institute (WRHI), which was part of the study.Infections occur in three groupsUsing ARVs to protect people from HIV is called pre-exposureprophylaxis (PrEP). Scientific studies have already shown that Truvada iseffective in protecting people from HIV during both anal and vaginal sex.The Department of Health decided to offer PrEP at certainclinics that serve sex workers, despite being under pressure to provide ARVs asprevention more widely available.Around half of the world’s new HIV infections occur in threegroups – sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users. InSouth Africa, HIV rates are very high among sex workers.“We found that many of the women cycled in and out of careas they felt more or less at risk, as reported by them,” said Eackle. “Somereported difficulties getting to the clinic at times due to work, family orother conflicts such as school.”Eakle said this and other studies “suggest that PrEP use islikely to be cyclical for many women, which is fine as they develop new habitsfor remaining negative. Perhaps the act of engagement in care in the largerpicture is what will keep them negative.” Sex work still a crimeSex work is illegal in South Africa, which makes it hard forhealth workers to reach and treat them.But Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told Health-e that“South Africa does not need to wait for laws to decriminalise sex workersbefore protecting this sector from HIV”.The country’s National Strategic Plan on HIV and TBrecommends decriminalising sex work, but last year the SA Law Commissionrecommended that sex work remain illegal.“The issue of sex workers is not just for the Minister ofHealth but involves other Ministers,” said Motsoaledi.“India has not decriminalised sex workers, but healthworkers in Bangalore are working very openly with sex workers and police arenot arresting them.” – Health-e News.","['dont', 'work', 'workers', 'mzansi', 'hiv', 'protect', 'truvada', 'sex', 'tested', 'protecting', 'prep', 'prostitutes', 'women', 'health']","~Despite being offered a daily pill to protect them from HIV, almost three-quarters of women sex workers had stopped taking the pills after a year.

The province aims to distribute at least 212 million free condoms each financial year. When it is fully functional, the factory will produce no fewer than 700 000 condoms per day, some of which will be exported to other African countries. KZN MEC for health Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: “We are very pleased that the plan to build a condom manufacturing plant in KZN has come to fruition. “The presence of this plant will go a long way to assist our programmes and prevent illnesses from spreading.” He said he would ask condom manufacturers to consider lowering the price of female condoms, which are more expensive than men’s condoms. Dhlomo said limited access to female condoms led to challenges as men were generally still stubborn, and many still had the upper hand in making decisions that may affect the sexual health of their partners negatively. HBM-SA Health Protection Services has invested R150 million in the project.","['condoms', '700', 'factory', 'men', 'million', 'day', 'manufacturing', 'produce', '000', 'province', 'plant', 'kzn', 'condom', 'health']","KZN has the highest HIV infection rate in the country and one of the leading causes of this scourge is that many men in the province allegedly still don’t use condoms.

They had no idea that Oprah Winfrey was about to walk into the conference room.When the queen of TV talk shows entered from the backstage area, they erupted in joyous screams. Their Mam’ Oprah, as they affectionately call her, walked into the conference room at the Premier Hotel at OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni.One would think Winfrey is used to joyous screams from fans and audiences, but she was overwhelmed by the love that the young attendants showered her with. Almost with a South African accent, she said, “Tjo!”, reacting to the 250 girls and young women who are supported by Dreams – Determined, Resilient, Empowered, Aids-free, Mentored and Safe – a US initiative that aims to reduce new HIV infections in adolescents and young women in 10 sub-Saharan African countries, including South Africa.In South Africa, the Dreams initiative focuses on priority areas – Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal – as these provinces have the highest HIV infection rate.In South Africa, adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) are eight times more likely to be infected with HIV than their male counterparts. Young women (20 to 24) are three times more likely to be infected than young men of the same age group.An inspiring success story Winfrey’s life story – from growing up in an impoverished Mississippi town where she was raped at a young age, falling pregnant and losing the baby, to being the queen of talk shows with her own TV network – inspires young women to look beyond their past and difficult circumstances.Winfrey poured her heart out to the audience. She told them about her religious upbringing, which she said was her pillar and strength, and how she climbed the ladder of success.“I grew up in the church. My grandmother led me to the sense of God and made me believe there was a greater force than me. I grew up believing that God was my father and Jesus was my brother, which meant I could do anything in life.“In life you cannot trust yourself only, there must be some higher force you trust in, be it God, the community or an organisation, because you cannot be successful on your own,” she told the girls, adding that their history and past experiences – no matter how unfortunate – should not define their future.“What you do today and where you see yourself is what matters.“You need to know what kind of woman you want to be and where you want to be, not just in terms of profession, but in life. Life will lead you where you want to go ... People pay attention to people who excel and excellence is a deterrent for sexism,” Winfrey said.The audience was given an opportunity to ask questions, many of which centred on how to keep young girls motivated and what they could learn from her success story.Source: City Press","['winfrey', 'life', 'god', 'mzansi', 'south', 'hiv', 'africa', 'tv', 'visits', 'oprah', 'young', 'girls', 'women']","They waited in anticipation for a “special guest”, as per the announcement by the host, US ambassador to South Africa Patrick Gaspard.

It is important to note that this is not the same asbeing gay. A gay man self-identifies as such and is “out” about his sexuality.A man who has sex with men does it “on the down low”, considers himselfheterosexual and is often married with children.The root cause of this is stigma about homosexualitywhich means these men will not disclose this, and often will not even do so withhealth professionals. Many MSM have multiple partners or pay for sex withyounger men.  Because this behaviour issecretive they are often unprepared and so do not use protection – and the realityis that anal sex is a high risk factor in terms of becoming infected with HIV. Stigma drives this issue underground.We say that homosexuality is a foreign concept thatarrived here in a ship, but we must also note that amagoduka (migrant workers) used to have such relationships in single-sexhostels, so it has been there for quite some time.  If a man does not want to tell people his sexualpreference, that is up to him.

MALEMA: RAMAPHOSA IS NOT A LEADER BUT A DEAL MAKER,"President Cyril Ramaphosa isn't a leader, but a dealmaker who became president to meet white leaders and clinch deals with them, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said.",News24.com,2018-05-26T08:26:21.000Z,"President Cyril Ramaphosa isn't a leader, but a dealmaker who became president to meet white leaders and clinch deals with them, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema said.Speaking at the party's Africa Day celebration event in Sunnyside in Tshwane on Friday, Malema said Ramaphosa became president to go around the world and make deals with white leaders - not to help the people of South Africa. ""Cyril doesn't need a salary. He took that position because of deal making,"" Malema said. ""He wants to go around the world making deals. That's why he wants to be president... He doesn't want to be president for the poor. He doesn't want to be president for the HIV patients."" ""He wants to be president so that he can have access to white leaders and then they clinch deals. He is not a leader, he is a dealmaker. That's who is he is."" Malema added that white people said Ramaphosa was the best president and that everyone else believed it. ""White people want us to believe that we have got our saviour, we've got an engine; Cyril Ramaphosa is coming to save us."" Malema added that Ramaphosa should be rejected for what he did to people in Marikana and for buying a buffalo for R18m. He said the president should also be rejected for giving half of his presidential salary to a new Madiba fund, saying it was a ""misdirected type of intervention.""""The money must go to the squatter camps. The money must go to the landless people. The money must go to the unemployed people. The money must go to the children of the domestic workers. That's where we need this money."" Malema also criticised those who applauded Ramaphosa for the move. ""You all clap hands as if he is the masterpiece, but this man is worth billions. Why can't he take half of what he is worth and give it to the poor? Why can't he take half a billion and give it to the poor?"" Speaking about Africa Day, Malema said it's a day in which Africans can celebrate themselves and tell the world that they are Africans and proud of their heritage. ""We are not ashamed of being African. We are not ashamed of being black."" He told the crowd that South Africans should be gathering on Africa Day, which should be a public holiday, to remind themselves of who they are and where they come from. In addition, he said that South Africans should welcome people from other African countries as the Khoi and the San once welcomed Africans from the north who travelled to Southern Africa to settle. ""None of us are from here, we come from the north and found the Khoi and the San when we settled here. The Khoi and the San welcomed us here. We should welcome others here the same way we were welcomed here."" Malema promised that the EFF would rename South Africa and call it Azania.  ""South Africa, we still don't have a name until today because South Africa is not a name. It's a direction."" ""We need a name for this beautiful country and that name will be given to this country by the EFF when we take over power in 2019. This country shall be declared Azania."" Before concluding his speech, Malema called on his supporters to register for the 2019 national elections.  ""Next year there [are] elections. Let's go and take this government. Go register because registration means you are armed and registration is a weapon that will be used to destroy the ANC.""News24  Sourcehttps://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-not-a-leader-but-a-dealmaker-malema-20180525","['leader', 'malema', 'deal', 'maker', 'ramaphosa']",MALEMA: RAMAPHOSA IS NOT A LEADER BUT A DEAL MAKER

He said he stopped paying papgeld in 2011 and added his attorneys have been struggling to reach Tsholo.But during Wednesday’s show an angry Tsholo snapped back.She told Mapaseka and the listeners: “He (Dingaan) was given a chance to be on the show in the child’s best interest. But instead he took that platform to assassinate my character and spread lies about me not allowing him access to the child.”Her manager and husband Chris Matshaba told Sunday Sun: “We had to fight for Tsholo to be able to give her side on the show. I contacted Mapaseka and her producer, asking them to give her the same opportunity he got.“Dingaan has never been denied an opportunity to see his child. We’re talking about two people who don’t know each other. She calls me papa.”Chris claimed: “Dingaan is lying about trying to reach Tsholo and not getting hold of her. He knows where she lives and knows where her parents stay.“They’re upset to have been dragged into this.”He alleged every year, Dingaan runs to the media without calling Tsholo.“He’s afraid to talk to her as he used to beat her up. When I met her she was not okay. She had to go through counselling and was traumatised by all the damage he had caused. It took her a year to heal,” claimed Chris.He said he has no issues with Dingaan, but he needs to respect Tsholo, his daughter and the rest of the family.This week Dingaan said: “I spoke too much about these things. I don’t have anything to say any more.”Tsholo said what Dingaan’s doing is annoying.“It bleeds through to my new family.
