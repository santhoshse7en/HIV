Report: 193 tested HIV-positive in 8 southern districts,The report highlights that returning expatriates are a prime contributor to spreading the virus,,2018-09-30,Dhaka Tribune,"Representational photo Bigstock The report highlights that returning expatriates are a prime contributor to spreading the virus According to a report released by a local volunteer organization, at least 193 people have tested HIV- positive in eight of the countrys southern districts. Among them, 84 (53 men and 31 women) have tested HIV-positive in Khulna district alone, while the other 109 are from the: Jhenidah, Gopalganj, Jashore, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Narail, and Magura districts. This is according to Mukto Akash Bangladesh (MAB) a volunteer organization workingon AIDS-related issues. When contacted, Khulna Civil Surgeon Dr Abdur Razzak said that they cross-checked the findings released by MAB and corroborated them, reports UNB. The report also said expatriates returning from foreign countries such as: India, Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and the USA, are the ones responsible for spreading the deadly virus in the districts. No HIV virus was detected among sex workers of the district. The number of deaths caused by the virus has been increasing rapidly in the southern districts, the report mentions. The worst-affected areas among the districts are Benapole, Chaugachha, and Khulna town, because the citizens of those areas frequently work in foreign countries, especially India, and carry the lethal virus back. Sources at Khulna Medical College and Hospital said at least 31 HIV patients underwent treatment at the hospital this year, and three have died. MAB Coordinator Rehena Begum said the organization is working on raising awareness among the public, regarding the deadly disease—as well as providing nutritional and medical support to HIV patients.",{},"['tested', 'organization', 'southern', 'volunteer', 'spreading', 'hiv', '193', 'virus', 'districts', 'hivpositive', 'khulna', 'report']","Representational photo BigstockThe report highlights that returning expatriates are a prime contributor to spreading the virusAccording to a report released by a local volunteer organization, at least 193 people have tested HIV- positive in eight of the country's southern districts.

World AIDS Day observed: Tuberculosis patients at high risk of HIV,The World Aids Day was observed yesterday across Bangladesh aiming at raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and to honour those who passed from AIDS related complications,,2016-12-02,Dhaka Tribune,"This year’s slogan for the day is “Let’s raise hands of unity, let’s prevent AIDS.” On the occasion, the STI/AIDS Network of Bangladesh, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and various NGOs brought out a processions from the Shahabag intersection on Thursday morning and paraded different thoroughfares before ending at Osmani Udyan. The reported number of HIV positive cases in the country was 4,143 with estimated number of nearly 9,000, according to the statistics of UNAIDS Bangladesh. According to the Mukta Akash Bangladesh, a non-government organisation, Tuberculosis patients are at high risk of the deadly disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Already three Tuberculosis patients in Khulna have been affected with HIV virus recently. According to the NGO, the numbers of HIV positive people are increasing day by day due to lack of consciousness. In last one year from December 31, 2015 to November 30, 2016, a total of 51 people, including 10 children were infected by HIV/AIDS in Khulna. Abu Mohammad Ali Javed, councilor and administrator of Mukta Akash Bangladesh, told the Dhaka Tribune that three Tuberculosis patients had been infected with HIV/AIDS recently. Terming Tuberculosis virus as nearly same as the HIV, he said: “A total of 37 people were infected with HIV virus in last one year from December 31, 2015 to November 30, 2016 in Khulna. Six of the affected died during the tenure.” Rehana Begum, co-coordinator of Mukta Akash Bangladesh, said: “A total of 69 people in the area are HIV positive and six of them already died. Most the infected are residents of Narail, Jessore, Satkhira and Bagerhat.” Senior Health Officer of Khulna Md Abul Kalam Azad, said: “In 2015 there were 25 HIV positive people in Khulna. In this year, 51 more people were infected with the virus.” Sources of World Vision Bangladesh said about 5.1 millon Indian are infected with HIV. Everyday nearly thousands truck driver entered Bangladesh and most of them are HIV infected. These drivers sometimes engaged in physical relation with Bangladeshi girls without using any protection. Not only this, in last two years, from 2014 to 2016, total 2,234 people in India have been infected by the HIV. Earlier, experts warned that Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country with several well-documented at-risk groups, the most prominent of which is brothel-based sex workers and injecting drug users. Although prevalence rate is remaining low in the country, it is surrounded by nations with much higher prevalence rates and with its own at-risk population. The World AIDS Day is observed on December 1 every year to raise awareness about acute immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV, and to demonstrate international solidarity in the face of the endemic. The day is an opportunity for public and private partners to disseminate information about the status of the pandemic and encourage progress in HIV prevention, treatment and care around the world, particularly in high prevalence countries.Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammad Nasim today said Bangladesh has been successful in controlling HIV and AIDS and it must continue the existing efforts to end these sexually transmitted diseases by 2030. “The government along with local and international organizations would be able to free the country from HIV and AIDS,” he told a discussion in the Osmani Memorial Auditorium here.",{},"['infected', 'total', 'patients', 'observed', 'world', 'hiv', 'bangladesh', 'virus', 'prevalence', 'aids', 'khulna', 'day', 'tuberculosis', 'high', 'risk']","According to the Mukta Akash Bangladesh, a non-government organisation, Tuberculosis patients are at high risk of the deadly disease Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

London HIV patient becomes world's second AIDS cure hope,"AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure",,2019-03-05,Dhaka Tribune,"AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV-resistant donor, his doctors said. Almost three years after he received bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after he came off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the mans previous HIV infection. ""There is no virus there that we can measure. We cant detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man. AIDS experts said the case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, and marks a ""critical moment"" in the search for an HIV cure, but does not mean that cure has already been found. Gupta described his patient as ""functionally cured"" and ""in remission"", but cautioned: ""Its too early to say hes cured."" The man is being called ""the London patient"", in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV. Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free. Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed about 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients. Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called Hodgkins Lymphoma. Last chance In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him. ""This was really his last chance of survival,"" Gupta told Reuters. The donor - who was unrelated - had a genetic mutation known as CCR5 delta 32, which confers resistance to HIV. The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of ""graft-versus-host"" disease - a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipients immune cells. Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people — most of them of northern European descent — who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus. ""Although this is not a viable large-scale strategy for a cure, it does represent a critical moment,"" said Anton Pozniak, president of the International AIDS Society. ""The hope is that this will eventually lead to a safe, cost-effective and easy strategy using gene technology or antibody techniques."" Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key - or whether the graft-versus-host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said. His team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. ""We need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,"" he said. The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details.",{},"['worlds', 'known', 'london', 'hope', 'hiv', 'man', 'aids', 'gupta', 'case', 'second', 'cure', 'experts', 'donor', 'patient']","We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

"Fight HIV, not sex workers",We need to address the social problems that make sex workers vulnerable to HIV,,2016-12-18,Dhaka Tribune,"“My father died in a road accident when I was only four years old. I never got a chance at schooling. At six I was sent to Dhaka for domestic work and continued till 13. Then my mother wanted me to get married, but I didn’t want that at the age of 13, so I escaped with a friend. But later I fell into the trap and became a sex worker. Since then I am into this trade, and often I am a victim of physical and sexual assault.” -- A sex worker. Each year we observe World Aids Day on December 1 along with the globe seeking to lift up awareness to prevent the spread of HIV or AIDS. Though Bangladesh has had a historically lower rate of HIV infection compared to the rest of the world, violence against female sex workers still remains a big threat in terms of HIV and AIDS. They are one of the key groups most vulnerable to HIV infection in Bangladesh and also in other countries of the world, along with people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, male sex workers, and transgender/hijra. But sex workers are among those who are most vulnerable to HIV infection, as it spreads rapidly among sex workers. In many cases, sex workers have no access to condoms, or are not aware of their importance. They are simply powerless to negotiate safer sex. Clients may refuse to pay for sex if they have to use a condom, and use intimidation or violence to force unprotected sex, and in many cases, they are raped. But because of the social stigma and marginalisation, they can’t even bring charges against their attacker. Criminalisation of sex work contributes to an environment in which violence against sex workers is tolerated, leaving them less likely to be protected from it. Many sex workers consider violence “normal” or “part of the job,” and do not have information about their rights. As a result, these contribute to their vulnerability to HIV. According to a recent study, the total estimated number of female sex workers in Bangladesh ranges from a minimum of 82,884 to the maximum of 102,260. In Bangladesh, they are mostly vulnerable due to social exclusionary factors such as low income, poverty, debt, unemployment, poor education, etc. Therefore they are mostly mobile, hidden, and likely to avoid disclosure of their status due to stigma and discrimination. Moreover, more than half (55.8%) of female sex workers interviewed reported to having sex for the first time before the age of 15, and the use of condoms during the last sexual encounter was relatively lower among young sex workers aged as compared to sex workers aged 25 years and above, which put them at a high risk of HIV infection. The risk of sexual transmission of HIV infection is well-established. An estimated number of 102, 260 female sex workers are engaged in this trade through brothels, hotels, residences, and street-based set-ups. Violence against sex workers is not only widespread, but is also perpetrated, legitimised, and accepted by many With their identities, they hardly get any basic services from hospitals and mainstream health providers. In situations where sex workers do not have access to condoms, HIV prevention information, and sexual health services, or are prevented from protecting their health and using condoms for any reason, they are at increased risk of contracting HIV. The story of the abovementioned sex worker is a real life experience that has reason to make us depressed about humanity. At 13, she was trapped in a cycle of sex work, and when she was 18, she got married to a man who was her pimp, and gave birth to a baby girl in the following year. But her husband didn’t welcome the girl child, and attempted to kill the little one. Luckily, her mother managed to escape with the girl. “I want to give my daughter education and a good life and I know I need money for that. That’s why I am still in this business and taking life risk to go with the clients in unknown places and do whatever they want me to do. Many times I faced gang rape and sex without condoms. I was heavily injured at times and managed to escape from being murdered.” Violence against sex workers is not only widespread, but is also perpetrated, legitimised, and accepted by many. It undermines HIV prevention efforts and increases sex workers’ vulnerability to HIV transmission in several ways. We need to get our act together to stop the violence against sex workers and help in preventing HIV. There is growing recognition that effective HIV prevention policies and programs focusing on sex workers must incorporate violence prevention strategies. Interventions to promote safer sex among sex workers must be part of an overall effort to ensure their safety, promote their health and well-being more broadly, and protect their human rights. There is also a need to recognise that not all sex workers see themselves as victims, oppressed, or exploited. Instead, many can and are taking control of their own lives, finding solutions to their problems, acting in their individual and collective interests, and contributing to the fight against HIV/ AIDS. Different international development organisations in Bangladesh, like Save the Children, have been operating 43 drop-in-centres (DICs) for female sex workers since 2008 to give psychological support and essential health services in 26 districts with support from the Global Fund. There are almost 26,000 female sex workers getting support. But that’s not enough. When responding to the HIV epidemic among sex workers, empowering them and involving them in HIV prevention are necessary. We also need to address the underlying social and structural problems that make sex workers vulnerable to HIV. By giving them greater legal protection against violence, and by reducing the discrimination they face, HIV prevalence could be cut dramatically.

HIV outbreak sparks panic in southern Pakistan,"Health officials say more than 400 people, many of them children, have tested HIV positive in recent weeks as experts warn of a surge in infection rates across Pakistan, due to the use of unsanitary equipment and rampant malpractice",,2019-05-16,Dhaka Tribune,"In this image taken on May 9, 2019, a Pakistani paramedic takes a blood sample from a girl for a HIV test at a state-run hospital in Rato Dero in the district of Larkana of the southern Sindh province AFP Health officials say more than 400 people, many of them children, have tested HIV positive in recent weeks as experts warn of a surge in infection rates across Pakistan, due to the use of unsanitary equipment and rampant malpractice Parents nervously watch as their children wait to be tested for HIV in a village in southern Pakistan, where hundreds of people have been allegedly infected by a doctor using a contaminated syringe. Dispatched to keep order, police scan the anxious crowd as families hustle into one of five different screening rooms set up in the last month in the village of Wasayo, on the outskirts of Larkana in Sindh province. Health officials say more than 400 people, many of them children, have tested HIV positive in recent weeks as experts warn of a surge in infection rates across Pakistan, due to the use of unsanitary equipment and rampant malpractice -- often at the hands of quack doctors. Anger and fear continue to swell in the desperately poor village hit hard by the epidemic, which authorities say could be linked to either gross negligence or malicious intent by a local pediatrician. ""They are coming by the dozens,"" says a doctor at the makeshift clinic, beset by a lack of equipment and personnel to treat the surging number of patients. Mukhtar Pervez waits anxiously to have her daughter tested, worrying a recent fever may be linked to the outbreak. For others, their worst fears have already become a reality. Nisar Ahmed arrived at the clinic in a furious search for medicine after his one-year-old daughter tested positive three days earlier. ""I curse [the doctor] who has caused all these children to be infected,"" he says angrily. Nearby Imam Zadi accompanies five of her children to be examined after her grandson tested positive. ""The entire family is so upset,"" she tells AFP. Others worry their childrens futures have been irreparably harmed after contracting HIV, especially in a country whose masses of rural poor have little understanding of the disease or access to treatment.

With about 20,000 new HIV infections reported in 2017 alone, Pakistan currently has the second fastest growing HIV rates across Asia, according to the UN. Pakistans surging population also suffers the additional burden of having insufficient access to quality healthcare following decades of under-investment by the state, leaving impoverished, rural communities especially vulnerable to unqualified medical practitioners. ""According to some government reports, around 600,000 quack doctors are operating across the country and around 270,000 are practicing in the province of Sindh,"" said UNAIDS in a statement. Provincial health officials have also noted that patients are at particular risk of contracting diseases or viruses at these clinics, where injections are often pushed as a primary treatment option. ""For the sake of saving money, these quacks will inject multiple patients with a single syringe. This could be the main cause of the spread of HIV cases,"" said Sikandar Memon, provincial program manager of the Sindh Aids Control Program. The large number of unqualified doctors along with the ""reuse of syringes, unsafe blood transfusions, and other unsafe medical practices"" have all led to the spike in HIV cases in recent years, explains Bushra Jamil, an expert on infectious diseases at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. ""Rampant medical malpractices without any effective checks and balances are causing repeated outbreaks in Pakistan,"" said Jamil. Authorities investigating the outbreak in Sindh say the accused doctor has also tested positive for HIV.

But for the parents of the newly diagnosed, the ongoing investigation means little if they are unable to secure access to better information and the necessary drugs that can help stave off the deadly AIDS virus.

Please accept me,” an 18 year-old teenage girl from Chittagong said to this reporter. She shared her story and her hopes with the Dhaka Tribune on Saturday morning, two days ahead of World AIDS Day. Alo – not her real name – passed her Higher Secondary Certificate exam this year from the Arts group and is now waiting to start her tertiary level education. She was infected with HIV in the womb. Her father, who infected her mother, died from AIDS in 2002 when she was 6. As far as she can remember, her father died from a severe sickness. No one then knew that he had AIDS. “We learned that my father was HIV positive when my mother fell severely ill the year after he died. We took my mother to many hospitals. Later we found out that she had AIDS too,” Alo said. In 2003, Alo lost her mother and she, together with her two elder sisters, were asked to be tested for HIV. The test revealed that Alo was HIV positive but her two sisters were not. Since then, Alo has been taking anti-retroviral medicines twice a day, everyday. “I did not know anything about HIV at the time. But I can remember that my bitter life started with that test result. “Even my two sisters did not keep me with them on the bed. They placed me on the floor while they slept on the bed,” Alo recalled as tears filled her eyes. “I can still remember that my utensils, clothes and other personal belongings were a different colour so as to be easily recognisable,” she said. “Everyone told me to stay away because I had a disease that could kill them. “I cried by myself. I have learnt how to cry alone and how to remain alone,” she said, her voice growing heavy. Her family told her she had a disease that could kill them, without a care for the fact that the disease could kill her. After slow exposure to the facts about HIV/AIDS, her sisters and relatives came to understand that it is not a contagious disease in the typical sense. They now understand how it is transmitted. Alo herself says she now understands that she need not bear any stigma for her HIV positive status. Alo has hidden her HIV status all of these years. Her sisters, all that survives of her nuclear family, and a handful of relatives know her condition. To the rest of the world, this part of her is invisible, she says, because of intolerance. She knows she would not be accepted by society, her school or her peers if they knew the truth. Her neighbours, relatives, friends and teachers do not know about her HIV status. I could never tell anyone about my disease because no one would understand me. They would misjudge me. Our society is not friendly towards us, she said. “I do not become too close to my sister’s child. I never kiss the child although I love the child very much and the child likes me as well,” she said. When asked why she doesn’t express her affection for the child, Alo replied: “Yes, I know it will not harm the child but I do not want to take a chance. I do not want to be the reason for anyone getting sick.” “I treat the child as my own,” she said. Alo shared her one great hope with the Dhaka Tribune and prays to God that her wish comes true. She wants a job of her own and a worthy husband who is also HIV positive. “It is very tough to remain unmarried. I want a husband who is also living with HIV. Only he will be able to understand me.” Alo hopes one day she can reveal her identity, when there will be no social stigma or discrimination. “I want to come out of my dark and lonely world.”",{},"['know', 'mother', 'child', 'disease', 'world', 'hiv', 'alo', 'accept', 'positive', 'understand', 'sisters']","Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Bangladeshi HIV positive baby, who has now grown into adulthood, dreams of the day she can show her face and say her name in dignity. “I am HIV positive. “We learned that my father was HIV positive when my mother fell severely ill the year after he died.

World AIDS Day: Rohingya influx triggers fears of disease spreading,"'An estimated 12,000 to 14,000 people are living with HIV in Bangladesh, as per the Asian Epidemic Model projection data where our prevalence rate is 0",,2017-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"Although Bangladesh has a lower than average prevalence rate of AIDS cases, the influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar has triggered fears that some of them may bring the deadly disease into the country along with them and cause it to spread. Experts have also expressed concern that a large number of AIDS cases in Bangladesh may be unidentified, artificially lowering the prevalence rate of the disease. A total 83 HIV positive Rohingya have been identified at the refugee camps in the southern part of the country so far, though Unicef HIV/AIDS specialist Dr M Ziya Uddin said Myanmar’s prevalence rate of 0.8% means as many as 5,000 infected Rohingya refugees may have arrived and remain unidentified. He added that two-thirds of all AIDS cases in Bangladesh are similarly in the shadows. “An estimated 12,000 to 14,000 people are living with HIV in Bangladesh, as per the Asian Epidemic Model projection data where our prevalence rate is 0.01%. However, we have only identified 4,721 of them,” Dr Ziya said. In addition, he said 24 children under the age of 10 were among 42 newly identified cases this year. According to data from the National AIDS/STD Programme, 799 people have died from the disease since the first AIDS case was identified in Bangladesh in 1989. Among them, 141 died this year. Sources from the Cox’s Bazar Civil Surgeon Office echoed Dr Ziya in saying that there may be thousands of AIDS affected Rohingya in the refugee camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas, and the disease could spread to the local community if they were not identified soon. Ukhiya Thana Health and Family Planning Officer Dr Mezbah Uddin said: “The Rohingya are not knowledgeable enough on health and disease prevention. They need to be made aware or diseases such as AIDS could easily spread to locals.” However, the health ministry has dismissed fears that AIDS may spread to the general population from Rohingya refugees, saying various measures under the AIDS/STD Programme of the Directorate of Health Services were in place to prevent such an incident. Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammed Nasim said: “Under the programme, various steps have been undertaken to prevent communicable and non-communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS among the Rohingya people staying at different parts of Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas in Cox’s Bazar district.” The measures included provision of free HIV screening and counselling services as well as distribution of kits to diagnose the virus at hospitals in Cox’s Bazar, he added. “In addition, necessary training was given to medical staff and antiretroviral drugs are being given to HIV-infected patients,” the health minister said. Meanwhile, Dr Ziya further said that it was not enough to restrict such programmes to just the Rohingya, and they should be included for the general population as well. “We need a structured programme based on data and evidence, not only for refugees but also for the host community, as the area was always a risk of HIV spreading in the Cox’s Bazar area because there are many immigrant workers in the region, and it is a tourist destination as well,” he said. According to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 250,000 people in Myanmar are affected with AIDS, with the country being one of 35 that account for 90% of new HIV infections in the world. World Aids Day was observed on Thursday, with WHO highlighting the need to include people with HIV in society under the slogan “Everybody counts.”",{},"['fears', 'triggers', 'influx', 'ziya', 'world', 'spreading', 'hiv', 'identified', 'bangladesh', 'spread', 'aids', 'rohingya', 'day', 'health', 'dr', 'disease']","Experts have also expressed concern that a large number of AIDS cases in Bangladesh may be unidentified, artificially lowering the prevalence rate of the disease.

"Five HIV patients now 'virus, drugs free'","A vaccine-based therapy helped five people with HIV to be “virus, drugs free” – one man has been free of the virus for seven months",,2017-02-24,Dhaka Tribune,"Five people with HIV are currently free of detectable virus – and daily drugs – thanks to a new vaccine-based therapy, reports the New Scientist . This therapy gives the immune system “the tools to flush out HIV, meaning daily drugs can be ditched.” Antiretroviral drugs (ART) are essential for most people with HIV. The drugs are used each day “to stop the virus from replicating and causing damage to their immune system.” These are required to be taken throughout ones lifetime as “the virus can hide away in tissues such as lymphoid and gut cells.” The virus has a tendency to re-emerge from cells – so stopping the use of ART becomes risky for patients. As much as ART is “effective” it is also expensive, takes a long time to work and comes with “nasty side effects.” In 2014, 24 people then recently diagnosed with HIV were given two vaccines developed by Tomas Hanke and his colleagues at the University of Oxford. This was part of a trial that Beatriz Mothe of the IrsiCaixa AIDS Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, and her colleagues started. All the participants were also given ART, then monitored “to see whether the vaccines induced a strong immune response.” A booster of the vaccines was given to all 15 of them this year and, finally, they were given three doses of romidepsin – “a cancer drug that has shown potential for flushing HIV out of hiding.” Eventually, all of them got another vaccine booster and stopped ART doses. The virus rapidly came back in 10 of the participants so they had to go back to ART medication. However, five of the participants “no longer needed to take the drugs because their immune systems could suppress the virus unaided.” “One person has been off ART for seven months now. The other four have been free of detectable virus for six, 14, 19 and 21 weeks, respectively,” writes the New Scientist. Mothe and her colleagues are currently working on to find out why “two-thirds of the group didn’t respond to the therapy.”",{},"['art', 'free', 'therapy', 'given', 'patients', 'colleagues', 'hiv', 'virus', 'immune', 'participants', 'vaccines', 'drugs']","Five people with HIV are currently free of detectable virus – and daily drugs – thanks to a new vaccine-based therapy, reports the New Scientist .

Surprising monkey study could lead to ‘functional’ HIV cure,"Dr Anthony Fauci doesn't get too excited about the results of animal studies, and he doesn't make house calls",,2016-12-03,Dhaka Tribune,"But when a drug already taken by thousands of people for intestinal conditions appeared to control the monkey version of HIV, it got the attention of the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci hopped on a plane to Cambridge, Mass., to personally tell Japans Takeda Pharmaceutical Cos US representatives that their drug may offer a dramatic advance in the fight against AIDS. Takeda’s drug suppressed the virus to undetectable levels in eight monkeys, some for two years. The findings raise hopes for a so-called ""functional cure"" – a treatment that puts the disease in sustained remission. ""The data was so dramatic,"" said Fauci, who has made AIDS research his life’s work. The drug is one of several promising ideas heading into early-stage human trials, all seeking to help patients control the virus that causes AIDS for extended periods without daily antiretroviral therapy (ART). The studies build on research propelled by the case of Timothy Ray Brown, the so-called ""Berlin patient,"" whose HIV was eradicated through an elaborate stem cell transplant in 2007. ""There has been this explosion of discovery,"" said Mitchell Warren, executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. ""There are completely new ideas that were impossible to conceive even a few years ago.""HIV once meant certain death. But, for more than half of the 36.7 million HIV patients around the world, ART transformed it into a chronic disease. Taken daily, ART suppresses the virus. But keeping up a daily medication regimen is difficult. The drugs are expensive and toxic, causing nausea, fatigue and nerve problems in the short-term, and insulin resistance and other problems over time. Only about a third of US patients take ART consistently enough to push the virus down to undetectable levels. “Were going to need other approaches,"" said Dr Nelson Michael, director of the US Military HIV Research Program at the Walter Reed Army Institute. Much work has focused on the discovery of rare antibodies made by HIV patients that can neutralize several different forms of the virus. One trial involving an antibody called PGT121 licensed by Gilead Sciences Inc reduced the virus to undetectable levels in 16 of 18 monkeys; the effect lasted for four months in three of them. At Walter Reed, Michael is taking a different tack, testing whether a vaccine - being developed to prevent HIV infection - can fight off the virus in infected individuals. Last month, Michael and researchers at Harvards Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center published the results of a monkey test of Johnson & Johnsons HIV vaccine candidate called Ad26/MVA and Gileads experimental drug GS-986. On its own, the vaccine had a modest effect. But it was even more effective when it was given with GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that “kicks the immune system up to a higher gear,” Michael said. All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for at least six months. Human trials could begin within months, said Dr Paul Stoffels, J&Js chief scientific officer. ""If the cure is there, the industry will find a way to get there very quickly,"" Stoffels said.Fauci’s visit was a first for Takeda, a company focused on treatments for cancer, gastroenterology and the central nervous system, said Dr Michael Shetzline, who heads clinical science for Takeda in Cambridge. “The excitement was just clear,” Shetzline said. “It was like, Wow."" Takeda does not study HIV. But its researchers understood the basic science surrounding its drug Entyvio, an antibody engineered to attack a specific protein. The drug, known generically as vedolizumab, is approved in more than 50 countries for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which occur when the immune system attacks the intestines. ""Entyvio is a cell trafficking molecule that affects immune responses,"" Shetzline said. ""In this instance, the GI tract is what is harbouring this HIV cell population that needs to be cleared - at least that is what the monkey study implies."" Takeda is providing the drug and supporting the study. Shetzline cautioned that its only a pilot. ""Wed love to see this benefit patients,” he said. If it pans out, cost could be an issue. Entyvio is priced as a biologic, similar to other IBD treatments, which range from $2,000 to $5,000 a month, according to Consumer Reports. Entyvios HIV trial began in August and seeks to enrol 15 to 25 people with stable disease. They will remain on daily ART drugs while taking nine infusions of Entyvio over a period of several months. Then, ART will be stopped, they will get two more infusions, and doctors will watch to see if the virus rebounds – or remains suppressed. Manni Baez, 30, of Columbus, Ohio, travels to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, about once a month for the study. “For me, the end game is providing the folks at NIH with the resources they need to get them closer to finding a cure or a vaccine for this plague,"" Baez said. Fauci said he doesn’t expect meaningful results until late 2017 or early 2018. Even partial success would be huge, he said. ""If we discontinue therapy in the 15, and four of them dont rebound,” he said, then “that is the best anybody has ever seen.” Fauci said he doesn’t get emotional about the data he collects, and, in any event, it’s early days for this research. “I try to be as objective as I possibly can,” he said. “I will get really excited if we get our first seven people in human (trial), and I stop ART - and they dont rebound.”",{},"['functional', 'art', 'michael', 'patients', 'vaccine', 'takeda', 'monkey', 'hiv', 'drug', 'virus', 'study', 'surprising', 'cure', 'shetzline', 'lead']","The findings raise hopes for a so-called ""functional cure"" – a treatment that puts the disease in sustained remission.

HIV-AIDS prevalence survey stopped since 2011,"Last year, a total of 338 new HIV patients were identified in the country, more than 45% of who were migrant workers
        	The internal and external migrant workers have been the biggest threats for spreading HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh as around 50% of the new AIDS patients were identified as migrant workers",,2013-11-30,Dhaka Tribune,"The internal and external migrant workers have been the biggest threats for spreading HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh as around 50% of the new AIDS patients were identified as migrant workers. Last year, a total of 338 new HIV patients were identified in the country, more than 45% of who were migrant workers. Though Line Director of National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP), Dr Abdul Wahed, admitted the high prevalence of HIV infection among migrant workers, he refused giving any details. Meanwhile, the health ministry did not have the actual data concerning this high-risk group as their survey has remained stopped since 2011. A highly-placed executive at a local NGO, seeking anonymity, told the Dhaka Tribune: “The sero-surveillance report is a must to get a clear picture of prevalence rate among the different high-risk groups. Currently, we are not getting the actual prevalence rate.” Under this circumstance, Bangladesh like all the other countries in the world will observe the World AIDS Day on Sunday. The theme for this year’s World AIDS Day is set “Getting to Zero.” According to health ministry, a total of 2,871 HIV-positive patients have been identified in Bangladesh since 1989, among who 1,204 became AIDS patients and 390 died. However, there were discrepancies between the public and NGO statistics regarding the numbers. MM Niazuddin, health secretary, at a press conference at the Secretariat on Saturday said five government hospitals would give patients free medicine and health treatment from January 1 next year. Arifur Rahman, divisional coordinator of AAS, said they had got 40 new patients, including 17 women and two children, in the current calendar year. All the newly-infected women had received the virus from their expatriate husbands while both children were born infected. “We are providing medical facilities to 81 females and 17 children.” All the females had received the virus from their husbands while all the children were born infected, he said. An official at the Hope said they were providing medical assistance to a total of 248 patients. Sixty-nine of their female patients had received the virus from husbands while seven children were born with the virus. Prof Dr AQM Sirajul Islam, former head of the department of shin and sexual disease at Chittagong Medical College Hospital told the Dhaka Tribune that mostly the wives and children of expatriate workers to the Middle East were facing such fate. “There are some procedures of conceiving baby for the HIV infected mothers. It is possible to keep the baby safe if the HIV infected parents consult the physicians before conceiving,” said Sirajul, who has long been working with AIDS patients. Brig Gen Khandakar Shahidul Gani, director at the CMCH, said they had taken up a Unicef-funded project to provide services to the HIV infected parents before and after having a baby. Ali Hossain, manager of the project, said 90% of the HIV positive children across the country were born infected. However, the ratio was 100% in Chittagong. “It is possible to bring the percentage down to only two through providing services to the infected parents,” he said. It has been learnt that the NGOs have not yet agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding with the government. It requires them to deposit 10-20% of the total funding as performance security. Habiba Akter, executive director of Ashar Alo, said it would not be possible to deposit a large amount of money which may hamper the treatment.",{},"['children', '2011', 'patients', 'hivaids', 'stopped', 'total', 'prevalence', 'hiv', 'migrant', 'born', 'world', 'aids', 'survey', 'health', 'infected']","The internal and external migrant workers have been the biggest threats for spreading HIV-AIDS in Bangladesh as around 50% of the new AIDS patients were identified as migrant workers.

9-year-old South African becomes third HIV infected child to go into remission,"The child was given a ten-month course of anti-AIDS medicine until she was one year old, then taken off the drugs as part of a medical trial",,2017-07-24,Dhaka Tribune,"Relapse possible Impressive A South African girl has become only the third child to beat the AIDS virus into long-term remission -- almost nine years and counting -- after receiving a drug cocktail in infancy, researchers announced Monday. The child was given a ten-month course of anti-AIDS medicine until she was one year old, then taken off the drugs as part of a medical trial. Eight years and nine months later, the virus is still dormant and the girl healthy without needing treatment, a research team reported at the International AIDS Society conference on HIV science in Paris. ""This new case strengthens our hope that by treating HIV-infected children for a brief period beginning in infancy, we may be able to spare them the burden of life-long therapy,"" said AIDS expert Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) which funded the study. [caption id=""attachment_111950"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""] Electron micrograph showing HIV particles inside a human cell[/caption] Some scientists refer to sustained, drug-free remission as a ""functional cure"". Unlike a traditional cure, where the virus is eradicated, the patient still has HIV in their system but it is so weakened that it cannot replicate or spread to sexual partners. Researchers hope that by treating people as soon as possible after infection, they can one day induce drug-free remission for sustained periods of time, perhaps for good. This has become a major focus of research amid fading hopes of finding a permanent cure. The virus has proven more sneaky than imagined -- it has the ability to hide out in human cells and play dead for years, only to re-emerge and attack as soon as treatment is stopped. Anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment inhibits the virus, but doesnt kill it, and infected people have to take pills daily for life which are costly and have side-effects.A rare group of infected people -- fewer than one percent -- are able naturally to stop the virus replicating. They are known as ""elite controllers"", but the mechanism by which they keep the virus at bay remains a mystery. The girl does not have ""elite controller"" DNA, said the study authors. Among people taking virus-suppressing anti-retroviral drugs, only a few have attained drug-free remission. They include 14 adults in a French trial who were able to quit their medication after three years and stayed healthy.

""Relapse is a possibility in any case of remission,"" underlined study co-leader Avy Violari of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. However, ""the fact that remission has been for a long period suggests this is likely to be durable,"" she said. Researchers do not understand how the girl achieved remission when 410 other children in the trial did not. ""We cant tell if her immune system would have controlled the virus on its own or if the treatment made a difference,"" said Sharon Lewin, a professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne.The girl was diagnosed HIV-positive on her 32nd day of life. After ten months of treatment, levels of HIV in her blood went from ""very high"" to undetectible.

"Mobile app tests blood for HIV, syphilis","Professor Sia's team's work is published in Science Tranlational MedicineA new smartphone app that tests blood samples for HIV and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world, scientists claim",,2015-02-05,Dhaka Tribune,"A new smartphone app that tests blood samples for HIV and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world, scientists claim. The software, developed by biomedical experts at Columbia University, analyses blood samples taken with a finger-prick dongle. The kit, which attaches to any smartphone or computer, replicates a lab test and can give a diagnosis in the field in just 15 minutes. The device is nearly 540 times cheaper than current lab testing machines, and has already been tested on patients in Rwanda during a pilot study. Health workers tested the blood of 96 patients who were enrolling into clinics aimed at preventing transmission of HIV from mother to child, or those visiting voluntary counselling and testing centres. The dongle was developed to be small and light enough to fit in one hand. It draws its power from the smartphone allowing it to be used in remote areas, providing the phone is charged. Samuel Sia, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia University, said the teams work showed that full laboratory-quality tests can be run on a smartphone app. This makes a diagnosis accessible to almost any population with access to smartphones. This kind of capability can transform how health care services are delivered around the world, he added. In the past, Professor Sias team has worked on creating miniature testing kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases. He said: We know that early diagnosis and treatment in pregnant mothers can greatly reduce adverse consequences to both them and their babies. The new kits are expected to cost around £22.50 to manufacture, compared with the £12,150 cost of a standard lab testing machine. In Rwanda, healthcare workers were given 30 minutes of training and 97% of patients said they would recommend the device. This was because of its fast turnaround time, ability to offer results for multiple diseases and the simplicity of procedure. Professor Sia said: “Our dongle presents new capabilities for a broad range of users, from health care providers to consumers. “By increasing detection of syphilis infections, we might be able to reduce deaths by 10-fold. And for large-scale screening - where the dongles high sensitivity with few false negatives is critical - we might be able to scale up HIV testing at the community level with immediate antiretroviral therapy. “This could nearly stop HIV transmissions and approach elimination of this devastating disease. “We are really excited about the next steps in bringing this product to the market in developing countries. “And we are equally excited about exploring how this technology can benefit patients and consumers back home.” Professor Sias teams work is published in Science Tranlational Medicine.",{},"['blood', 'app', 'smartphone', 'patients', 'world', 'hiv', 'testing', 'diagnosis', 'tests', 'lab', 'mobile', 'workers', 'syphilis']","A new smartphone app that tests blood samples for HIV and syphilis in just 15 minutes could save millions of lives across the world, scientists claim.

Sanofi tests three-in-one antibody to treat or prevent HIV,Other experiments showed the novel antibodies were active against 99% of more than 200 diverse strains of HIV tested,,2017-09-22,Dhaka Tribune,"A three-pronged man-made antibody, created by French drugmaker Sanofi and US scientists, could offer a new way to treat or prevent HIV, following successful tests in monkeys. Other experiments showed the novel antibodies were active against 99% of more than 200 diverse strains of HIV tested. The results were published in the journal Science on Wednesday.t Plans are under way to try the so-called trispecific antibody in initial human trials before the end of 2018, potentially adding a new weapon in the fight against AIDS, assuming the product proves safe and effective. If all goes well, the three-in-one antibody could be used either as a long-acting treatment or a vaccine, according to Sanofi Chief Scientific Officer Gary Nabel. “There is certainly urgency for a vaccine and this could help fill that void,” he said in an interview. “But we need to do the clinical studies and let nature tell us what works.” Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose experts collaborated on the project, described the new approach as “intriguing”. Unlike naturally occurring antibodies, the laboratory-made ones hit multiple biological targets in a single product - a feature that is particularly valuable in fighting HIV, given the huge genetic diversity of viruses around the world. After exposing 24 monkeys to two strains of a monkey form of HIV, researchers found the majority of those given a traditional antibody developed infection compared with none of those receiving the trispecific one. The ability of trispecific antibodies to hit three targets at once might also make them useful in fighting cancer, other infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. A number of drug companies are already working with bispecific antibodies but a three-pronged approach takes things to the next level. “This is the beginning of a technology platform that we could adapt to other diseases, so we will look carefully at that,” Nabel said.",{},"['trispecific', 'threepronged', 'vaccine', 'antibodies', 'threeinone', 'hiv', 'prevent', 'treat', 'antibody', 'diseases', 'strains', 'tests', 'way', 'sanofi', 'targets']","A three-pronged man-made antibody, created by French drugmaker Sanofi and US scientists, could offer a new way to treat or prevent HIV, following successful tests in monkeys.

Poor facilities scourge for HIV patients,'The patients lose self-respect and gradually become isolated from their families and society'The dearth of adequate healthcare services has left AIDS patients in the country helpless as they continue to suffer from the incurable disease,,2014-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"The dearth of adequate healthcare services has left AIDS patients in the country helpless as they continue to suffer from the incurable disease. Besides, discrimination and negligence that HIV patients frequently face at public and private hospitals in the country heighten their woes as there is still a social stigma attached to the disease. The Health Ministry on January 1 this year introduced a free healthcare service in public hospitals for HIV-positive people, but it has not been much fruitful. NGO officials have blamed the ministry’s lack of adequate preparation for this. They said the government had installed eight machines to count CD4 cells of AIDS patients at hospitals in Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Chittagong, Rangpur and Sylhet, but most of those do not function properly. The CD4 cell counting machine at Chittagong Medical College Hospital has been out of commission for a year, and the hospital’s Head of Microbiology Department Dr Khan Mashrequl Alam told the Dhaka Tribune that a lack of maintenance support was the reason behind it. “We heard that the government would arrange training on how to operate and maintain such machines, but that has yet to happen. The machine in our hospital displays an error message and I think there is a software problem,” he said. “The lack of maintenance staff forces us to contact officials in Dhaka in case of any technical problem,” he added. Dr Husain Sarwar, line director of National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP), told the Dhaka Tribune that the CD4 machines are not frequently used as the number of HIV patients is low. “But we always try to fix the machines whenever there is any trouble,” he said. But Halida Khandaker, executive director of Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP), said the government did not disseminate information about the machine. “How can the patients go to hospitals if they are not aware that such machines exist? There is also the problem of unfriendly attitude of those providing treatment at hospitals. We have yet to see any experienced and competent staff who can provide healthcare services for HIV patients,” she said. At present, patients need to take HIV test at the ICDDR,B and Infectious Diseases Hospital, both located in Dhaka. The test is also costly. Three NGOs – Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash and the CAAP – now offer free antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to HIV patients, while the NASP also provides free medical treatment. Habiba Akter, executive director of Ashar Alo Society, said HIV patients coming from poor families could run into trouble in the future as they cannot afford better treatment abroad. “The poor only go to the NGOs and government hospitals for treatment, and that is a cause for concern as the government has not been able to ensure proper medical services for HIV patients. The hospitals will face a serious crisis in terms of the supply of ARV medicine, proper nutrition services and mental support that the patients need,” she said. Dr Rashidul Hoque, senior medical officer at the CAAP, said AIDS patients largely feel guilty about themselves and also suffer from mental agony when they think about the future of their families. “The patients lose self-respect and gradually become isolated from their families and society,” he said. UNAIDS Country Director Leo Kenny told the Dhaka Tribune that HIV treatment needed to be comprehensive, and merely providing ARV drugs would be of no use if nutrition services were not arranged and infections were not treated. “AIDS is a syndrome and not a single disease. People die not from a single infection, but a range of infections which afflict people because their immune system is suppressed and cannot fight off infections from a number of other diseases, like tuberculosis and cancer,” he said. According to government statistics, 3,241 people have been diagnosed with HIV infection in the country between 1989 and 2013, 1,299 of whom contracted AIDS and 472 died from it. 370 new HIV-positive patients were identified in the country last year. UNAIDS data says the estimated new infections have increased by 25% in Bangladesh since 2001 and the reported new infections has increased 1.5 times over the past five years. The number has been especially increasing in some key population, such as sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgenders, etc. There were more than 9,000 people in the country living with HIV infection in 2013, two-thirds of whom did not know their status, according to an estimate by the UNAIDS.",{},"['hospitals', 'infections', 'country', 'patients', 'hiv', 'machines', 'services', 'aids', 'poor', 'facilities', 'scourge', 'dhaka', 'treatment']","The dearth of adequate healthcare services has left AIDS patients in the country helpless as they continue to suffer from the incurable disease.

India set to run out of critical free drug for HIV/AIDS programme,The government provides more than one-third of India’s 2,,2014-10-01,Dhaka Tribune,"India could run out of a critical medicine in its free HIV/AIDS drugs programme in three weeks due to bureaucratic bungling, a senior government official said, leaving more than 150,000 sufferers without life-saving drugs for about a month. Missed dosages for long durations can increase patients’ drug resistance and result in faster spread of the virus, while changes in medication regimens expose patients to side effects. The supply crunch will be an embarrassment for the four-month-old government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to deliver more affordable and better health services. As drugs in the open market are expensive, the government provides more than one-third of India’s 2.1 million HIV/AIDS patients with free antiretroviral drugs that are procured from pharmaceutical companies via a tender process. Delays in approving such tenders has left the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) scrambling to secure supplies of tenofovir/lamivudine tablets that are prescribed to thousands of patients during initial stages of treatment. “We are also fed up. What to do? There are so many bureaucratic hurdles. The file goes to so many tables, and so many comments,” NACO Deputy Director General A.S. Rathore told Reuters. Several sources, company executives and documents seen by Reuters revealed that a tender for the medicine was approved last week, but supplies normally take at least 60 days to reach patients, which in this case would take it to late November. NACO had raised the demand in January, Rathore said. Patients and activists complained of shortages of several HIV drugs in September, forcing one group to send a legal notice to India’s health secretary, Lov Verma. Verma directed NACO to take stock of the programme and told Reuters on Sept. 4 that the situation was not as grave as activists described. However, Rathore said on Tuesday that the programme had only 1.6 months of tenofovir/lamivudine tablets in stock on Sept. 4. That means, supplies will run out in about 20 days from now. As of Sept. 24, 10 Indian states had less than a month of stocks of such tablets, data available on NACO’s website showed. NACO is now leaning on companies - including Aurobindo Pharma, one of the manufacturers that has been awarded the contract - to help avert a crisis.",{},"['critical', 'rathore', 'free', 'tablets', 'told', 'patients', 'hivaids', 'drug', 'supplies', 'naco', 'programme', 'sept', 'set', 'run', 'india', 'drugs', 'verma']","India could run out of a critical medicine in its free HIV/AIDS drugs programme in three weeks due to bureaucratic bungling, a senior government official said, leaving more than 150,000 sufferers without life-saving drugs for about a month.

Health ministry to provide free AIDS treatment,"Five public hospitals to be brought under the scheme initially from January, other to follow suit
        	The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is going to introduce a free health service for HIV/AIDS patients in the public hospitals starting on January 1, 2014",,2013-11-28,Dhaka Tribune,"The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) is going to introduce a free health service for HIV/AIDS patients in the public hospitals starting on January 1, 2014. Five medical college-hospitals in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet and Rajshahi would be brought under the scheme primarily with the others to follow suit, officials said. The ministry may sign an agreement with three NGOs any day soon, which will be responsible for monitoring and supervising the service. The organisations are Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash and CAAP (Confidential Approach to Aids Prevention). However, several top officials of the NGOs said the initiative may not have likely effects because of the ministry’s lack of preparation in this regard. For one, they argued, the doctors, nurses and supporting staff of the hospitals should be given special training before introducing the service, so that they can provide proper health care to people living with HIV (PLWHIV). For another, lack of adequate machinery and equipment. It has been learnt that the ministry had bought eight modern “CD-4 Cell Machines” – necessary for HIV positive patients – for different public hospitals about four years ago, but only four of them have remained functional because of the scarcity of reagents. But MM Niazuddin, secretary of MOHFW, is hopeful they can ensure quality health service for the HIV patients. “They are many challenges to overcome, the most important one being the social stigma attached to those contacting HV. They continue to face discrimination even though 24 years had lapsed since the first HIV positive case was detected in the country. But we are hopeful we can ensure quality service for them,” he said. He was speaking at a press conference at the Secretariat on the eve of the World AIDS Day-2013, which will be observed on December 1 with the theme “Getting to Zero”. However, the newly appointed Health Minister Rowshan Ershad was conspicuously absent from the conference although she was scheduled to be there. In his address, the health secretary said, “HIV/AIDS is just a disease and anyone suffering from a disease should not be seen as a criminal or pitied upon. They deserve to live like any normal citizens.” He stressed the need for increased awareness of the disease and removing disparity based on diseases. Highlighting the overall scenario of the disease, he said HIV prevalence in the country was still low. Only 2,871 HIV-positive patients have been found in Bangladesh since 1989 when the first case of its kind was detected. Amongst them, 1,204 become AIDS patients and 390 of them died. He also said Bangladesh had been selected as the organising country of the International Congress on Aids in Asia and the Specific (ICAAP), scheduled to be held in 2015.

World AIDS day Today,Bangladesh will observe World Aids Day today to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS and to honour those who passed from AIDS related complications,,2016-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"Although Bangladesh has had a historically lower rate of HIV infection, a lack of awareness, safe sex practices and detection centers mean public health is still at risk. The National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP project under the Health Ministry is the largest national AIDS prevention and care program which will end on December 31 leaving the very vulnerable at risk of contracting and those already affected. The NASP is implemented by three NGOs – Mukto Akash, CAAP Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP) and Ashar Alo on a field level.

Unicef: 80 adolescents to die of AIDS globally a day by 2030,United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on Thursday,,2018-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on Thursday Today is World Aids Day. In Bangladesh, HIV prevalence among the general population remains low (<0.1%) while around 80 adolescents will die of AIDS globally every day by 2030 as per current trends. United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on Thursday. Some 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030, according to the new Unicef report. This means, the report said, 76 adolescent deaths every day, without additional investment in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) prevention, testing, and treatment programs. In 2017, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) reported that among the 865 new reported cases, more than 5% affected were children and adolescents less than 18 years of age, and 25% were women. Unicef Bangladesh and National HIV Program of the government are working on sustainability and scaling up of services for the prevention of mother to child transmission, HIV prevention, treatment, and care for most at risk adolescents, and the protection, care, and treatment of children affected by AIDS. The report, “Children, HIV and AIDS: The World in 2030,” noted that based on population projections, and at current trends, the number of 19 year-olds newly-infected with HIV will reach an estimated 270,000 in 2030, decreasing by one third over current estimates. It showed that the number of children and adolescents dying from AIDS related causes will decline, from a current 119,000 to 56,000 in 2030. However, this downward trajectory is too slow, particularly among adolescents. According to the report, by 2030, the number of new HIV infections among children in the first decade of life will be cut in half, while new infections among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years old will only decrease by 29%. AIDS related deaths are projected to decrease by 57% among children below the age of 14, compared with a 35% decrease among those aged 15 to 19 years. Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore said: “The report makes it clear, without the shadow of a doubt, that the world is off track when it comes to ending AIDS among children and adolescents by 2030. “Programs to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to babies are paying off but haven’t gone far enough, while programs to treat the virus and prevent it from spreading among older children are nowhere near where they should be.” Unicef estimates that nearly 700 adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 are newly infected with HIV every day, or one every two minutes. The report also noted that an estimated 1.9 million children and adolescents will still be living with HIV in 2030, mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa (1.1 million), followed by West and Central Africa (571,000), and Latin America and the Caribbean (84,000). Currently, 3 million children and adolescents are living with HIV around the world, more than half of them in Eastern and Southern Africa. Reductions in the number of 0-19 year-olds living with HIV between 2018 and 2030 will also vary by region, with the greatest decline in South Asia (close to 50%) and Eastern and Southern Africa (40%). By contrast, that number will only decline by 24% in Central and Western Africa, the region with the second highest burden. Many children and adolescents do not know whether they have HIV or not, and among those who have been found HIV-positive and put on treatment, very few adhere to that treatment. To address these persistent gaps, the report recommends a number of approaches supported by Unicef, including: family-centred testing to help identify and treat children living with HIV but not yet diagnosed; more diagnostic technologies at the point of care to improve early infant diagnosis; greater use of digital platforms to improve HIV knowledge among adolescents; adolescent-friendly services; and targeted community outreach for adolescents. “We can’t win the fight against HIV if we don’t accelerate progress in preventing transmission to the next generation,” said Fore. Fore further said: “We must maintain the sense of urgency to sustain gains made in the past decade for both boys and girls. And to do this we must look to innovative and preventative ways of reaching the most vulnerable and at-risk young people.”",{},"['die', 'children', 'report', 'unicef', '2030', 'globally', 'world', 'hiv', 'adolescents', 'number', 'aids', 'day', '19', '80']","United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) published a report on AIDS on ThursdayToday is World Aids Day.

Some 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030, according to the new Unicef report. It showed that the number of children and adolescents dying from AIDS related causes will decline, from a current 119,000 to 56,000 in 2030.",https://www.dhakatribune.com/health/2018/12/01/unicef-80-adolescents-to-die-of-aids-globally-a-day-by-2030

Foreign donors to stop funding for AIDS patients in Bangladesh,"The HIV patients will face serious crisis when the Global Fund to Fight AIDSA precarious time lies ahead for the country’s HIV-positive and AIDS patients as international donors organisation providing preventive measures for HIV infection, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for HIV-positive and AIDS patients, are pulling out their operations in Bangladesh",,2014-11-30,Dhaka Tribune,"A precarious time lies ahead for the country’s HIV-positive and AIDS patients as international donors organisation providing preventive measures for HIV infection, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for HIV-positive and AIDS patients, are pulling out their operations in Bangladesh. Agencies like USAID and Save the Children have already stopped their operations concerning HIV/AIDS patients, including medical treatment, since the government announced in 2009 that it would provide all necessary treatment to HIV patients from 2012, to be funded by the World Bank. However, it has yet to put such mechanism in place in the country. The HIV patients will face serious crisis when the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria stops their project at the end of this year, followed by the Swiss Red Cross which will end their project next year. Since starting their operation in Bangladesh in 2004, the Global Fund has invested around $131m in Bangladesh to continue HIV prevention and AIDS control efforts. The Swiss Red Cross started their activities in 2000. Three local NGOs – Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash Bangladesh and Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP) – are also currently working for the HIV patients and provide them with free medicine and other necessary treatment. They are funded by the aforementioned donor agencies and will struggle to provide their services when the donors stop their funding here. As the government has no proper institutional support for these patients, they will have nowhere to go for the free medical treatment, counselling, physical and mental health support and other services once the NGOs shut down. The Dhaka Tribune talked to UNAIDS Country Director Leo Kenny, who said: “Bangladesh treats all people who need Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) free of charge. But we are facing a situation where the government has agreed to take over procurement and distribution of ART treatment from the Global Fund. We are facing procurement delays and this needs to be sorted out immediately.” Delay in government initiative Despite the announcement in 2009, it was in 2013 when the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP) started working on a project titled “Comprehensive care, support and treatment of PLHIV (people who are living with HIV)” to provide treatment and other services in collaboration with NGOs directly involved with this particular field. The plan was approved by The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in August last year and by World Bank in October. But the NASP later informed the government that the plan needed to be revised. “We found that it was not possible to implement the plan with direct collaboration with the NGOs and it required revision,” NASP Line Director Dr Husain Sarwar Khan told the Dhaka Tribune. “It has been delayed due to the whole process of reviewing the plan and other formalities. We hope that the government will implement the plan very soon.” Gaps and challenges According to government statistics, 3,241 people have been diagnosed with HIV infection in the country between 1989 and 2013, 1,299 of whom contracted AIDS and 472 died from it. 370 new HIV-positive patients were identified in the country last year. UNAIDS data says that the estimated new infections have increased by 25% in Bangladesh since 2001 and the reported new infections has increased 1.5 times over the past five years. The number has been especially increasing in some key population, such as sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgenders, etc. There are more than 9,000 people in the country living with HIV, two-thirds of whom did not know their status, according to an estimate by the UNAIDS last year. The most updated scenario will be announced today, on the occasion of the World AIDS Day. There have been many challenges regarding the detection and treatment of HIV patients, despite their low number compared to the country’s total population. Talking to the Dhaka Tribune, several HIV/AIDS patients said they preferred going to the NGOs where they can get proper treatment by keeping their identity secret, as well as proper counselling. In addition patients and NGO officials alike claimed that the government had not created a friendly environment for HIV/AIDS patients in government and private hospitals, and the patients have to suffer fear, social stigma and discrimination. Leo Kenny said: “The main reason people do not access testing is stigma and discrimination, so we need to address this. Repealing the punitive laws and policies will be a big step in the right direction. “There are important capacities which need to be built especially at a district and upazila level. Bangladesh has good guidelines and algorithms for prevention, treatment care and support, but for them to be fully implemented major capacity building needs to ensue.” Amitabh Sharma, the newly-appointed country representative of Swiss Red Cross in Bangladesh, said the main challenge is the lack of institutional support and a strong institutional structure from the government. “It is high time that the government should take the leading position. We do not lead; we can only provide support. We, the donors, can never be the substitute to the government,” he told the Dhaka Tribune. Habiba Akhter, executive director at Ashar Alo Society, said: “The government should bring all vulnerable people under the HIV identification process, otherwise there is no guarantee to prevent further infection. “We only find HIV patients when they become weak and are continuously suffering from diseases and infections. To bring these people under the identification process, a fair and supportive environment should be ensured at all levels of society. “The sooner people come to test for HIV infection, the sooner they can get treated in case of infection,” she told the Dhaka Tribune.",{},"['stop', 'support', 'plan', 'foreign', 'patients', 'bangladesh', 'hiv', 'donors', 'aids', 'provide', 'funding', 'ngos', 'dhaka', 'treatment']","A precarious time lies ahead for the country’s HIV-positive and AIDS patients as international donors organisation providing preventive measures for HIV infection, as well as treatment and rehabilitation for HIV-positive and AIDS patients, are pulling out their operations in Bangladesh.

Foreign Minister Dipu Moni handed over a formal letter from the Saarc Secretary-General to Runa Laila yesterday during a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital, UNB reported. Runa Laila was nominated as one of the three Saarc Goodwill Ambassadors for HIV/AIDS at a meeting of the selection committee held at the Saarc Secretariat, Kathmandu early this year. The two other Saarc Goodwill Ambassadors are Bollywood star Ajay Devgan and Pakistani journalist and documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. The committee considered 10 nominations from the Saarc member states based on the individuals’ regional stature and eminence, appeal to the target audience, relevance in delivery of message, likely commitment and innovative ways that could be utilised in promoting advocacy and awareness in combating HIV/AIDS. While expressing her reaction to media, Runa Laila said: “I surely feel happy. It’s a matter of honour for me. My work has just started from today.” Runa Laila said her key work would be to create awareness among people about HIV/AIDS. “In our region, the perception and idea is low about the HIV/AIDS.” She said she did not communicate with the other two ambassadors. “I hope I will work together with them.” The Saarc Goodwill Ambassador programme was conceived in 2008 with an aim to engage regionally well-known personalities to create greater awareness about HIV/AIDS in South Asia and to facilitate the implementation of Saarc regional strategy and its work plan on HIV/AIDS. The Goodwill Ambassadors under the programme undertake visits to the Saarc countries to raise awareness and advocate greater support to the fight against AIDS. Their interactions with children and people affected by HIV and AIDS help remove the social stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS.

UN: Mobile dating apps spur HIV epidemic among Asia’s teenagers,"United Nations research has found the growing use of mobile dating apps by young gay men is a major factor in a new HIV epidemic among teenagers in Asia, the Guardian can reveal",,2015-11-30,Dhaka Tribune,"United Nations research has found the growing use of mobile dating apps by young gay men is a major factor in a new HIV epidemic among teenagers in Asia, the Guardian can reveal. The report uncovered a surge of HIV infections among 10-19 years olds in the Asia-Pacific region, where more than half of the world’s 1.2 billion adolescents live. The two-year study found that smartphone dating apps have expanded the options for spontaneous casual sex as never before. The epidemic is fastest growing amongst men who have sex with men. Other groups include those who are sexually exploited by or engaged in sex work, people who inject drugs, and young transgender people. “Young gay men themselves have consistently told us that they are now using mobile dating apps to meet up for sex, and are having more casual sex with more people as a result. We know that this kind of risky behaviour increases the spread of HIV,” said Wing-Sie Cheng, HIV/Aids adviser for Unicef in east Asia and the Pacific. “We are therefore convinced that there is a link, and that we need to work better with mobile app providers to share information about HIV and protect the health of adolescents.” The previously unreported epidemic threatens the UN’s goal to end the global Aids crisis by 2030, which appeared achievable after a sharp drop in Africa during the past 15 years. Adolescents are also more likely to die of Aids-related deaths, researchers from Unicef and UNAIDS found, as they are less inclined to seek treatment, fearing they will be stigmatised or forced to expose their sexuality to their family or the authorities. In many countries in the region, under-18s cannot get an HIV test without parental consent. While global HIV infections are falling, the number of adolescents aged 10-19 officially living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific has grown to more than 220,000, with the unofficial number expected to be much higher, Unicef says. Fewer than half of them are receiving treatment and deaths have risen nearly every year for a decade. An HIV-positive Filipino man aged 30, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect himself from abuse, said it was hard to find sex for a gay teenager, bullied at school and closed off from the adult-only gay bars. At university, the introduction of internet dating — chat rooms and online forums — allowed him to find more sexual partners his age. He would chat with men and agree to rent a room for a few hours in the capital. “If I write down all the people I had sex with in Manila, I can probably write one to five people for each stop of the metro,” he said. Smartphones and mobile dating revolutionised his sex life. Whereas internet dating involved a laborious process of arranging a meeting up, dating apps are location-based, allowing users to scan their surroundings for others. “Even if you’re still in school and you feel the need to have sex, you just open Grindr,” he said. “You don’t even have to talk to them. People just send you naked photos or photos of their cocks. If you’re fine with them, you just go and have sex.” The immediacy of the sex, organised in minutes, made condom use less likely, he said. “I did use condoms. But it was not consistent. You don’t want to lose the momentum.” Despite his promiscuous mobile dating years, the Filipino man’s HIV test returned negative and he entered into a long-term relationship. But two years later he contracted the virus from his boyfriend who was secretly cheating on him by using mobile dating apps. In the Philippines, new HIV infections among teenagers have doubled in four years. In Bangkok, young gay men now have a one in three chance of HIV infection. And eighteen countries across the Asia-Pacific region criminalise against same-sex relationships — which UNAIDS says causes gay men to avoid life-saving HIV services. A separate study last year found that men who have sex with men using dating apps are at greater risk of contracting gonorrhoea and chlamydia than those who meet in-person or on the internet. Wing-Sie, the Unicef adviser, said that dating apps create networks of men, in which infections rapidly spread among users. “Mobile dating apps essentially hook you up to a central network.” She said the study looked at observational trends around the region reported by United Nations officers and local community workers who said their HIV strategy urgently needed to adapt to the explosion of mobile dating apps. “HIV is a covert issue, it is very hidden. So data is not available.” She said researchers found “that with the rise of these apps, the probability and risk of infection will increase multifold because it makes it so much easier for them to date other guys and hook up for sex,” she said. A spokesman from Grindr, used in 196 countries worldwide with 1 million active users every minute, said it has a minimum age requirement of 18. “As the world’s largest gay platform, we take matters of sexual health very seriously,” the spokesman said, adding that Grindr runs in-app announcements encouraging testing at local clinics. David S Novak, senior health strategist at Online Buddies, the parent company of the dating app Jack’d, directed the Guardian to its ManHunt Cares project, which provides health resources to its users. In 2009, the company also set up a research institute focusing on gay sexual health. Other major dating app companies Tinder, Blued and Growlr did not respond to requests for comment. The UN report says these apps can become vital conduits promoting sexual health, including HIV messaging and testing, and references a 2014 World Aids Day project by the Chinese gay dating app Blued where a red ribbon was added next to every user’s profile picture, linking to details of nearby testing centres. Wing-Sie said Unicef will approach mobile dating app companies in the coming months for a “collaborative effort” and so the world body might collect data to further investigate the impact of mobile dating. Based in Bangkok, Jesse Krisintu has been working with charities trying to persuade young people to get tested for HIV through tactics such as pop-up advertisements on dating apps. He said the project did not work. “It’s their business. If they advertise too much about HIV/Aids services there, do you think people are going to go online?” he said. He said that one project involving pop-ups offered discounts on HIV tests but that very few were claimed and that the analytics shows most users immediately closed the pop-up advert. “The application is where the key population is but no one is going to read the pop-up because the purpose of people going to those apps to find sex, not to find knowledge. The results are not that favourable,” he said. “People just close it.” The UN is now also advocating for comprehensive sex education — beyond a simple explanation of the sex organs — and for reducing the age at which adolescents can take an HIV test without parental consent. AIDS is already the leading cause of death for adolescents in Africa and the second leading cause of death among adolescents globally, tripling over the past 15 years and mostly as a result of mother-to-child transmission. However, this new breed of epidemic found in Asia-Pacific could be replicated elsewhere, public health officials warn. “There is a risk of not being able to eliminate Aids at all,” Wing-Sie said. “This is the new frontier of Aids to tackle right now. The world can never end Aids if this issue is not controlled.”",{},"['asias', 'unicef', 'users', 'hiv', 'gay', 'teenagers', 'spur', 'men', 'health', 'apps', 'sex', 'mobile', 'epidemic', 'dating']","United Nations research has found the growing use of mobile dating apps by young gay men is a major factor in a new HIV epidemic among teenagers in Asia, the Guardian can reveal.

WHO: Health service still inaccessible to HIV-vulnerable groups,"For people who inject drugs, studies show the risks of HIV infection can be also 50 times higher than the general populationFailure to provide adequate HIV services for key groups – men who have sex with men, people in prison, people who inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people – threatens global progress on the HIV response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned",,2014-07-13,Dhaka Tribune,"Failure to provide adequate HIV services for key groups – men who have sex with men, people in prison, people who inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people – threatens global progress on the HIV response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. Although these people are most at risk of HIV infection, they are the least likely to have access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. In many countries they are left out of national HIV plans, and discriminatory laws and policies are major barriers to access. The observations were made as the WHO on Friday released the “Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations,” in the lead-up to the International AIDS Conference in Australia’s Melbourne beginning on July 20. The guidelines outline steps for countries to reduce new HIV infections and increase access to HIV testing, treatment and care for these five “key populations.” They include a comprehensive range of clinical recommendations; but, for these to be effective, the WHO also recommended countries to remove the legal and social barriers that prevent many people from accessing services. For the first time, the WHO strongly recommended men who have sex with men consider taking antiretroviral medicines as an additional method of preventing HIV infection (pre-exposure prophylaxis) alongside the use of condoms. Modelling estimates that pre-exposure prophylaxis could reduce global HIV incidence by around 20-25% among men who have sex with men, up to 1 million new infections among this group could be averted over 10 years. Studies also indicate that women sex workers are 14 times more likely to have HIV than other women, men who have sex with men are 19 times more likely to have HIV than the general population, and transgender women are almost 50 times more likely to have HIV than other adults. For people who inject drugs, studies show the risks of HIV infection can be also 50 times higher than the general population. “None of these people live in isolation,” said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, director of the HIV Department at WHO. “Sex workers and their clients have husbands, wives and partners. Some inject drugs. Many have children. Failure to provide services to the people who are at greatest risk of HIV jeopardises further progress against the global epidemic and threatens the health and well-being of individuals, their families and the broader community.” At the International AIDS Conference 2014 in Melbourne, the WHO will call on governments to re-energise and strengthen HIV programmes so that all key populations benefit from the ongoing advances in HIV treatment and programme scale-up.",{},"['times', 'service', 'women', 'groups', 'hiv', 'likely', 'key', 'services', 'men', 'health', 'sex', 'inaccessible', 'workers', 'hivvulnerable', 'treatment']","Failure to provide adequate HIV services for key groups – men who have sex with men, people in prison, people who inject drugs, sex workers and transgender people – threatens global progress on the HIV response, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned.

Passengers with HIV sue China’s Spring Airlines,"China only lifted a longstanding ban on foreigners with HIV entering the country in 2010Two passengers with HIV are suing a budget Chinese airline for refusing to let them board a plane, BBC reported",,2014-08-16,Dhaka Tribune,"Two passengers with HIV are suing a budget Chinese airline for refusing to let them board a plane, BBC reported. Local media reports say the two men and a friend - who does not have HIV - were prevented from boarding a Spring Airlines plane at Shenyang airport. The three of them are accusing the airline of discrimination. A court in Shenyang accepted their case on Friday. Rights groups say that widespread stigmatisation of people with HIV and Aids still exists in China. The airline’s president Wang Zhenghua said on Tuesday that the company did not discriminate against HIV carriers, and blamed the incident on staff anxiety, according to the AFP news agency. But he also blamed the passengers, and said the firm would allow HIV-positive travellers to board their planes as long as they did not make themselves “overly noticeable” to avoid scaring other customers. Spring Airlines’ website states that it has the right to refuse passage to those with “infectious diseases.” An airline spokesman told Caixin that since the incident, the airline has not turned away any HIV-positive passengers. According to a report in the Fazhi Evening Paper the three men were preparing to board a flight to Shijiazhuang, which is south of Beijing, on 28 July when they were stopped by officials. One passenger told the paper: “After we got our boarding passes, we informed a Spring Airlines official that some of us had HIV.” “The official immediately rang up the Shanghai head office for instructions, and then told us the company has rules forbidding the transportation of passengers with HIV.” The passenger said they were unable to negotiate with airline officials, who terminated the three passengers’ tickets. They eventually took a train to their destination. The three plaintiffs are now demanding compensation of 48,999 yuan (£4,771, $7,967) and an apology from the airline, said The Global Times. Last year, a government proposal to ban HIV patients from using public bathhouses was met with strong criticism.

        	This month somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the one millionth baby will be born without HIV to a mother who suffers from the disease, thanks in large part to a decade-old US aid programme",,2013-06-18,Dhaka Tribune,"This month somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the one millionth baby will be born without HIV to a mother who suffers from the disease, thanks in large part to a decade-old US aid programme. It is yet another remarkable step in the long fight against HIV and Aids, as the United States and its global partners work towards what they call an Aids-free generation. Effective anti-retroviral drugs and regimens are now dramatically cutting the chances of an infected mother passing on the disease to her baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The millionth baby born HIV-free was Tuesday to be trumpeted as part of celebrations to mark the 10th anniversary of the US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar). The biggest fall in transmission rates from mom to infant has come since 2009, US Global Aids coordinator Eric Goosby told AFP. “Somewhere round 430,000 babies are born annually with HIV and this project that we’ve been in really since the beginning of Pepfar and has intensified over the last three years in partnership with UNAid and Unicef,” Goosby said. The programme was working to “virtually eliminate paediatric HIV by 2015 and keep their mothers alive,” he said, with aim of reducing the number of babies born with the infection to around 30,000 annually. This is “a significant flag for Pepfar” which works in 36 countries, he added, pointing to all the difficulties in reaching women in rural, poor and remote areas of the world. Once the chances of a mother infecting her baby stood at around 30 percent, but now with the launch of a cocktail of three anti-retroviral drugs that has dropped to only about two percent, Goosby said, adding, “With the Pepfar programme we’ve been able to very specifically target 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa which make up about 85-90% of the paediatric burden on the planet,” said Goosby. US Secretary of State John Kerry, hosting Tuesday’s ceremony, was also to announce that some 13 countries, from Botswana to Zimbabwe, were close to that all important “tipping point.” In Ethiopia and Malawi, the ratio of new HIV infections to the increase of patients on treatment is just 3%. The figures are startling. Ethiopia – which with a population of 84.7m is the most populous African country after Egypt – for instance registered only 11,000 new cases of HIV in adults in 2011. Launched under former president George W Bush, Pepfar was an initial commitment of around $15bn over five years aimed specifically to provide anti-retroviral drugs to HIV infected people. That has risen to a budget of about $5.5bn annually, including its contribution to the Global Fund – the world’s largest financing organization of programmes to fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria.",{},"['mark', 'countries', 'mother', 'hivfree', 'born', 'hiv', 'birth', 'programme', 'pepfar', 'aids', 'global', 'set', 'goosby', 'millionth', 'drugs', 'baby']","This month somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa the one millionth baby will be born without HIV to a mother who suffers from the disease, thanks in large part to a decade-old US aid programme.

HIV infections plummet since 2001: UN,"<br />
        	2",,2013-09-23,Dhaka Tribune,"New HIV infections have plummeted by a third overall since 2001 and more than halved among children, the United Nations said Monday. Globally, 2.3 million people contracted the AIDS virus last year – down 33% from 2001, while 260,000 children became infected – over a third fewer than in 2009 and 52% down from 2001. “The annual number of new HIV infections continues to decline with especially sharp reductions in the number of children newly infected with HIV,” said UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe. Hailing progress in distributing antiretroviral drugs that prevent the transmission of the virus from pregnant women to their unborn children, the UN body said it may be possible to slash new infections among kids by 90% in the next two years. In its annual report on the state of the global pandemic, the agency said the drugs had prevented more than 670,000 children contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS from 2009 to 2012 alone. In sub-Saharan Africa – home to 90% of the world’s 3.3 million infected youngsters – the decline was particularly striking. In Ghana, for instance, 90% of pregnant, HIV-positive women had access to antiretroviral treatment last year, up from just 32% three years earlier. As a result, the likelihood of women in the country infecting their unborn children dropped from 31% in 2009 to just nine% last year, said UNAIDS. Increased access to the drug “cocktail” which curtails HIV transmission but does not cure it, has helped reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths among all age groups by 30% since they peaked in 2005, the report said. In a foreword to the 269-page report, Sidibe hailed “continued progress towards the global vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.” Last year, 1.6 million people died AIDS-related deaths, down from 1.8 million in 2011 and 2.3 million in 2005. The report showed that 9.7 million people in low- and middle-income countries, the bulk of those infected, had access to HIV drugs last year, compared to only 1.3 million seven years earlier. While the hike is impressive, it falls short of a UN target announced two years ago to reach 15 million people by 2015. And it represents only 34% of the 28.3 million people who need the drugs, under new guidelines released by the World Health Organisation in June. The increased access to treatment also means that more people are living with HIV, according to UNAIDS. Some 35.3 million people were living with the virus last year – about 70% of them in sub-Saharan Africa – up from 30 million in 2001. Sidibe insisted the 2015 target for global access to antiretrovirals remained in sight, but stressed the world must “have the vision and commitment to ensure no one is left behind”. Obviously, this will put a strain on world purse strings. UNAIDS said international donor contributions to combating HIV had remained flat since the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, and individual countries were increasingly picking up the tab to beat HIV at home. Last year, nations accounted for 53% of the $18.9bn set aside to fight the virus. The UN has set a target of $22-24bn by 2015. Earlier this year, Sidibe insisted the investment would pay off, pointing out that “fewer deaths, less sickness” takes a burden off the healthcare system, allowing HIV-positive people to work and contribute to the economy for longer. “If we do not pay now, we will pay later, we’ll pay forever,” he said.",{},"['children', 'infections', 'access', 'hiv', '2001', 'virus', 'plummet', 'pay', 'global', 'million', 'infected', 'report']","New HIV infections have plummeted by a third overall since 2001 and more than halved among children, the United Nations said Monday.

"Study: Indian police extort transgender sex workers, increasing HIV risk",The HIV prevalence among India's transgender community is estimated at 7,,2018-01-23,Dhaka Tribune,"Police in India routinely extort female transgender sex workers, which pressures them to earn more by engaging in unsafe sex that increases the risk of disease, researchers say. Gender minorities need more protection and police need sensitivity training, said a report by the Chennai-based Centre for Sexuality and Health Research and Policy (C-SHaRP) and the Mumbai-based Humsafar Trust. ""We found that transgender women have poor earnings and they have to share that too with the police and ruffians who exploit them,"" said Venkatesan Chakrapani, a doctor who chairs C-SHaRP and has researched the transgender community for years. ""Because of this extortion, they try to earn more and do not insist their customers use condoms,"" he added. The study was based on interviews with 300 transgender women working in the sex industry in major Indian cities. The results showed that they face a high risk of abuse and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The HIV prevalence among Indias transgender community is estimated at 7.5%, much higher than the countrys average of 0.3%, government data shows. Transgender women fear police action under a British colonial-era law that prohibits ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal,"" which is widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex. ""Biologically, most transgender women are born as males, so it is not clear whether they could be penalised for having sex with a man,"" Chakrapani said. Indias 2011 census recorded half a million transgender people, but campaigners estimate the number at about 2 million. Less than half are literate and even fewer have traditional jobs, according to the census. In a landmark 2014 judgment, the Supreme Court granted legal status to transgender people and made them eligible for quotas in employment and educational institutions. However, social bias continues and they are denied education and jobs, forcing many of them into the sex industry, campaigners say. ""If they are begging or are engaged in sex work, they face more abuse from the police,"" said Shubha Chacko, executive director of the Solidarity Foundation, which helps transgender people find jobs. Doley Barman, director of the National Police Academy, said police training includes ""sensitisation modules on dealing with the transgender community,"" as well as visits to areas where trainees can interact with transgender people.",{},"['jobs', 'community', 'training', 'increasing', 'extort', 'hiv', 'women', 'man', 'transgender', 'workers', 'study', 'indian', 'need', 'million', 'sex', 'risk']","Police in India routinely extort female transgender sex workers, which pressures them to earn more by engaging in unsafe sex that increases the risk of disease, researchers say.

Researchers found that in contrast to global trends, deaths from HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh increased by a rate of 1.9% (compared to 1.5% globally) between 2000 and 2013. On the other hand, deaths from TB and malaria have fallen at a faster rate than the global average at 6.7% (compared to 3.7% globally) and 11.1% (compared to 3.1% globally), respectively, between 2000 and 2013. The study also showed that from 2000 to 2013, Bangladesh had a large decline in malaria deaths, dropping from 114 in 2000 to 32 in 2013. In a press release issued on Wednesday, the ICDDRB said The Lancet report showed that worldwide, HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria killed fewer people than in the past, with declines in new cases and deaths accelerating since 2000. The study further revealed that there were a total of 204 tuberculosis (TB) cases per 100,000 people in Bangladesh in 2013, and 193 new cases of TB per 100,000 were diagnosed that year. In comparison, there were seven cases of HIV/AIDS per 100,000 in Bangladesh in 2013, and less than one new infection per 100,000 for that year.

        	Some 34 million people worldwide have the HIV virus that causes AIDS and the vast majority of them live in poor and developing countries<br />
        
        	Doctors could save three million more lives worldwide by 2025 if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday",,2013-06-30,Dhaka Tribune,"Doctors could save three million more lives worldwide by 2025 if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday. While better access to cheap generic AIDS drugs means many more people are now getting treatment, health workers, particularly in poor countries with limited health budgets, currently tend to wait until the infection has progressed. But in new guidelines aimed at controlling and eventually reducing the global AIDS epidemic, the UN health agency said some 26million HIV-positive people - or around 80% of all those with the virus - should be getting drug treatment. The guidelines, which set a global standard for when people with the virus should start antiretroviral treatment, were drawn up after numerous studies found that treating HIV patients earlier can keep them healthy for many years and also lowers the amount of virus in the blood, significantly cutting their risk of infecting someone else. “[This] is not only about keeping people healthy and alive but also about blocking further transmission of HIV,” said Gottfried Hirnschall, the WHOs HIV/AIDS department director. Some 34 million people worldwide have the HIV virus that causes AIDS and the vast majority of them live in poor and developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is by far the worst affected region. But the epidemic - which has killed 25million people in the 30 years since HIV was first discovered - is showing some signs of being turned around. The United Nations AIDS program says deaths from the disease fell to 1.7million in 2011, down from a peak of 2.3million in 2005 and from 1.8million in 2010. Swift progress has also been made in getting more HIV patients into treatment, with 9.7million people getting life-saving AIDS drugs in 2012, up from just 300,000 people a decade earlier, according to latest WHO data also published on Sunday. Indian generics companies are leading suppliers of HIV drugs to Africa and many other poor countries. Major Western HIV drugmakers include Gilead Sciences, Johnson & Johnson and ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline. Margaret Chan, the WHOs director general, said the dramatic improvement in access to HIV treatment raised the prospect of the world one day being able to beat the disease. The guidelines also say all pregnant or breastfeeding women and all children under five with HIV should start treatment immediately, whatever their CD4 count, and that all HIV patients should be regularly monitored to assess their ""viral load."" This allows health workers to check whether the medicines are reducing the amount of virus in the blood. It also encourages patients to keep taking their medicine because they can see it having positive results. The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) welcomed the new guidelines but cautioned that the money and the political will to implement them was also needed. The WHOs Hirnschall said getting AIDS drugs to the extra patients brought in by the new guidelines would require another 10% on top of the $22-$24bn a year currently needed to fund the global fight against HIV and AIDS.",{},"['sooner', 'halt', 'guidelines', 'save', 'patients', 'hiv', 'lives', 'spread', 'virus', 'aids', 'drugs', 'health', 'getting', 'whos', 'treated', 'wants', 'treatment']","Doctors could save three million more lives worldwide by 2025 if they offer AIDS drugs to people with HIV much sooner after they test positive for the virus, the World Health Organisation said on Sunday.

Life as a transgender child in Bangladesh,There is too much ugliness in a short time,,2018-10-28,Dhaka Tribune,"The stigma of being a transgender in Bangladesh still remains | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka Tribune There is too much ugliness in a short time Rupa (not real name) is a 14-year-old child who likes lining her eyes with coal pencils and playing dress up. She is a transgender – locally known as hijra – deprived of access to education, healthcare, and the right to live a somewhat decent life in society. Rupa used to live with a transgender community in Mirpur, Dhaka. She was born in Habiganj, Sylhet where she used to live with her family before. But at the tender age of seven, she had to leave it all behind because she did not fit in. Named Karim (not real name) by her parents, Rupa’s father bought her typical male clothes when she was younger. Her family introduced her as their son, but she identified as a girl and liked wearing her sister’s clothes. Her orientation and behaviour incited anger within her family; she was beaten and ridiculed and eventually forced to leave home. “I never went to school, even though all my siblings did. My father did not admit me to school; he said I brought shame to the family and because of me he lost his honour in society,” Rupa told the Dhaka Tribune. Also Read- Being transgender is no longer a mental illness “My family used to call me abnormal. My step-brother hit me regularly to ‘straighten’ me up. They did not even try to understand me,” the teenager said. Deprived of basic needs When Rupa fell ill, her family never took her to the hospital. “My father used to tell me that I am abnormal. He used to say abnormal people do not need any treatment; he said it would be better if I died. My mother would bring me medicine from a dispensary. But I was never taken to any doctors for healthcare,” she told this reporter. The transgender child laments about never being treated the same as her siblings because she is different. “My mother took care of my siblings, fed them big pieces of fish and meat, but she always neglected me.” Rupa’s is not an isolated case. Most transgender children of Bangladesh grow up in a state of insecurity and abuse. Sexual harassment In her short life, Rupa has already seen much of the ugly side of life. After she left home, a lot of people took advantage of her. Some offered to marry her; others wanted sexual relationships and offered to pay her. She was coerced into having sex on several occasions. “I was very young when some people wanted to employ me as a sex worker. Sometimes people would offer me Tk500-1,000 for a night. They used to touch me inappropriately,” she said. Also Read- Pakistani transgender set on fire for resisting sexual assault “I have a boyfriend. I had four other boyfriends before this, but they all left after a few months. Some of them got involved with me because they wanted physical relationships. But their families would never accept me as I am a transgender.” When asked why she sexually involved herself with her previous boyfriends, she said she was lonely and wanted company; if she did not allow sexual relationships, they would not stay with her. Men took advantage of her because she was an outcast and would not be able to speak out against their wrongdoings. Discrimination everywhere Before Rupa became a part of the transgender community in Mirpur, she knew nothing about the risks of unprotected sex. The community educated her on the matter. She now understands how AIDS spreads and how to better shield herself against such diseases. However, she still does not know if she has already contracted an STD. No hospitals or doctors want to provide services to transgender people. “The doctors avoid us. They do not want to help us,” Rupa said. Rekha, who is Rupa’s “guru,” said: “I took her in when she was seven because no one else was there to look after her. All of us face discrimination from an early age – Rupa is no different. Also Read- Growing up transgendered: Injustice of being denied an identity “When she got sick, I took her to a hospital where doctors refused to treat her. This has happened to us all. “People think we are somehow bad. But why? We are human beings, just like them. We have the right to live safely and with dignity like everyone else.” Rekha said because transgender people are not accepted in society, they cannot get jobs like everyone else. This is why they have to resort to begging and asking for money from local shops and businesses. Communities like this largely make their living by doing sex work or extorting money from other people. Currently, there is no widespread system that can support them. But Rupa does not want to spend her life begging for money. Rupa left the transgender community in Mirpur some time ago, and is currently back in her hometown Habiganj. She now works with a group of transgender people in that area who provide catering service for wedding ceremonies. Transgender people in Bangladesh There is a lack of accurate data on the transgender people in the country. According to the Department of Social Services, there are about 10,000 transgender people across the country. However, there is no data on transgender children. According to the Directorate General of Health Services, around 0.7% of the transgender population has HIV-prevalence, while less than 0.1% are HIV-positive, as of 2015. The ICDDRB conducted a research on transgender people in Dhaka in 2015. During the research, they spoke with 570 transgender people, of whom 67.2% were found to be involved in sex trade.

Let’s talk about AIDS,The key to HIV prevention efforts in Bangladesh is to identify those people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV,,2013-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"World AIDS Day 2013 is about ending stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV and people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV. Everyone has a right to live a full and productive life with dignity. No one should experience discrimination because of who they are, what they do, or whether they are HIV positive or not. The challenge for the HIV prevention program now is to overcome stigma and discrimination and reach those in need of HIV testing and treatment. Presently, only 27% of 3,000 adults estimated to be eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are receiving it, despite an estimated 8,000 people living with HIV in Bangladesh. However, the new WHO guidelines recommend that treatment of people living with HIV starts earlier, when the patient’s CD4 cell count is at 500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood, instead of a CD4 count of 350. CD4 cells are the white blood cells that the virus attacks, and are an indicator of health and immune system status. This means that people living with HIV can access treatment earlier when they are healthier and their immune system is stronger, which gives better treatment results and reduces the risk of opportunistic infections. Hence, those people living with HIV who are eligible for treatment (ie CD4 count of 500 or lower) will double to approximately 6,000. Effective ART reduces the number of viral particles in body fluids to undetectable levels, minimising the risk of further transmission. The new WHO guidelines recommend treatment as prevention for couples where one of the partners has HIV; the infected person should start ART irrespective of CD4count in order to prevent transmission to the uninfected partner. This could be further extended to include all people with HIV with a high risk of transmitting the infection. Therefore, the current efforts to find, test, and treat people who are at risk of contracting or transmitting the virus must be scaled up immediately. The key to HIV prevention efforts in Bangladesh is to identify those people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV. Yet the attitudes and behaviour of people towards others plays a major factor in the success of the program. Stigma and discrimination hinder the HIV/AIDS response in Bangladesh, and around the world, because individuals who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV fear that identification as a person at risk will cause them to be judged, feared, hated and discriminated against. Stigma and discrimination disproportionately affect those most vulnerable, including those who are sex workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, transgenders, women and girls. As a result, people are less likely to engage in safe sex practices, such as using a condom, or seeking education or support services. Therefore, those who are at risk of becoming infected are more vulnerable to infection, those who are already infected don’t know their HIV status and continue to spread the virus, and those who know they are infected may forego potentially lifesaving treatment, care and support. Stigma and discrimination must be addressed so that those at risk can feel safe in participating in HIV prevention programs and accessing support services and treatment. HIV is everyone’s business, and so is ending stigma and discrimination. Recognising and challenging the myths and misconceptions that surround HIV and its transmission is crucial. Education campaigns help to create awareness, but challenging deep-seated value judgments of gender roles and behaviours is crucial to creating safer, more accepting environments. In order to reach the thousands of Bangladeshis living with HIV, and those at risk of becoming infected with HIV, the HIV prevention program must drastically scale up efforts to find, test, and treat key affected populations. Support from the Government of Bangladesh, civil society organisations, communities, religious organisations, schools, and others is vital in helping to spread the HIV prevention message and creating an environment where those who are at risk no longer fear stigma and discrimination. Everybody has a role to play in getting to zero discrimination and supporting the HIV prevention efforts so that Bangladesh will one day be free of HIV/AIDS.",{},"['talk', 'efforts', 'infected', 'cd4', 'hiv', 'prevention', 'aids', 'discrimination', 'lets', 'living', 'risk', 'stigma', 'treatment']","World AIDS Day 2013 is about ending stigma and discrimination of people living with HIV and people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV.

Test for HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases (STDs) 2. Test for blood group 3. Test for sickle cell gene 4. Fertility test 5. Testing for possible genetic/chronic medical conditions Premarital health screening is characterised as directing examination for couples planning to wed; keeping in mind that the end goal is to recognise if there is any damage with hereditary blood maladies, for example, sickle-cell anemia (SCA) and Thalassemia, and some infectious sicknesses, for example, hepatitis B, C and HIV ""Aids"". This is so as to give restorative counsel on the chances of transmitting these diseases to the next generation later on, and to give choices and alternatives before prospective weds with the point of helping them get ready for a healthy, sound family. This article should not give you cold jitters but rather help you understand the physiology of your partner to build the right kind of diet, habits and plan for children. It is only to help couples equip themselves with the right knowledge and tools to move forward in the together-life. There are many accredited premarital screening centres throughout Bangladesh; in fact any mediocre healthcare facility will provide the service.With prevalent pervasiveness of HIV and different STDs, it is essential that life partners should ask for their accomplices to be screened for these sicknesses prior to marriage. HIV, hepatitis B and C are long lasting conditions that if not legitimately treated can put genuine strain on the marriage.Knowledge of your spouse blood group, through premarital tests, will alert your doctor to institute preventive measures which are used to prevent rhesus incompatibility reactions during pregnancy.Sickle cell Anemia is an incessant and incapacitating medicinal condition caused by deformity in red blood cells. As the name infers, these cells are molded as a sickle and this influence their capacity to go through little veins to supply oxygen to cells and tissue. This calls for most emergencies experienced by sickle cell patients.This may sound strange or unusual, yet frankly, fertility test is one more of the premarital tests that all planning roadsters ought to do before saying “I do.” This is imperative since fertility issues can be tended to but the treatment may span over a long period of time, even a couple of years, yikes! So it is best to start early.Marriage is a deep rooted responsibility with the two partners taking care of each another. Learning of conceivable hereditary or interminable states of your partner will go far in helping the two on the most proficient method to best plan for the difficulties ahead. Early testing permits couples to look for restorative care before the medicinal conditions get to its terminal stage. This test depends on the region and the common chronic/genetic condition seen in that populace. Be that as it may, it should certainly incorporate screening for diabetes, test for hypertension, certain cancers, kidney diseases and test for Thalassemia.",{},"['blood', 'couples', 'fertility', 'premarital', 'hiv', 'sickle', 'diseases', 'need', 'test', 'tests', 'health', 'screening']","Test for HIV and other sexual transmitted diseases (STDs)2.

The court on April 22 will consider whether the requirement, which has not been enforced since a 2006 injunction, is valid under the US Constitution.

World AIDS Day observed,"370 new HIV cases detected in the country
        	This year 370 HIV infections have been detected in the country, along with 95 AIDS cases and 82 related deaths",,2013-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"This year 370 HIV infections have been detected in the country, along with 95 AIDS cases and 82 related deaths. The information was disclosed by Health Secretary MM Niazuddinin at an exhibition programme held on Sunday at the Bangladesh International Conference Centre (BICC) to mark World AIDS Day. He said the number of new HIV infections was 338 in 2012, while the number of patients with AIDS was 103 – with 65 dying from the disease. The first HIV case diagnosed in Bangladesh was in 1989. He stressed the need to create awareness to counter the stigma attached to the disease, and said its prevalence in Bangladesh was still low, with a recent figure putting the number of people living with HIV at 3,241. However, the UN estimates the actual number to be between 8,000 and 16,000, which means many cases are left undetected and untreated. World AIDS Day was observed on Sunday in the city with an elaborate programme to raise awareness of HIV. The programme is aimed especially at youths, to help prevent the spread of the disease in the country. In a joint initiative of the National AIDS/STD Programme, the Health Ministry and various NGOs, a procession was brought out on Manik Mia Avenue and an exhibition was held at the BICC, reports BSS. The theme this year was “Three Zeros: zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths.” Health Minister Rowshan Ershad, who inaugurated the day at the BICC as the guest of honour, also emphasised the need for awareness in order to control HIV infections. She said: “Most of the people in Bangladesh do not have enough knowledge regarding AIDS and HIV, in particular married women and the younger generation should be educated about the disease to enable its prevention.” The minister urged all people to work together to achieve the target of ‘the three zeros’ by 2015. President of the network PLHIV Habiba Akhter said very few HIV patients have been given Anti-Retroviral (ARV) treatment, and that many have remained without treatment because of the social stigma. She said intensive campaigns to increase awareness are needed across the country in order to remove the social stigma and misconception about HIV. Speakers at the programme also called for regular blood tests for sex workers and drug addicts. Other speakers were Director General of the Health Service Prof Dr Khandaker M Sefayetullah, UNAIDS Country Coordinator Dr Leo Kenny, WHO Representative to Bangladesh Dr Tushara Fernando, and Bangladesh Medical and Association Secretary General Dr Iqbal Arsalan. World AIDS Day is celebrated on December 1 every year to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS, and to show international solidarity in the face of the epidemic.

The beginning of the end for Aids?,"United Nations data show that in 2013, 35 million people were living with HIV, 2",,2014-12-01,Dhaka Tribune,"The world has finally reached “the beginning of the end” of the AIDS pandemic that has infected and killed millions in the past 30 years, according to a leading campaign group fighting HIV. The number of people newly infected with HIV over the last year was lower than the number of HIV-positive people who joined those getting access to the medicines they need to take for life to keep AIDS at bay. But in a report to mark World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, the ONE campaign, an advocacy group working to end poverty and preventable disease in Africa, warned that reaching this milestone did not mean the end of AIDS was around the corner. “We’ve passed the tipping point in the AIDS fight at the global level, but not all countries are there yet, and the gains made can easily stall or unravel,” said Erin Hohlfelder, ONE’s director of global health policy. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is spread via blood, semen and breast milk. There is no cure for the infection, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years with cocktails of antiretroviral drugs. United Nations data show that in 2013, 35 million people were living with HIV, 2.1 million people were newly infected with the virus and some 1.5 million people died of AIDS. By far the greatest part of the HIV/AIDS burden is in sub-Saharan Africa. The AIDS pandemic began more than 30 years ago and has killed up to 40 million people worldwide. The United Nations AIDS agency, UNAIDS, says that, by June 2014, some 13.6 million people globally had access to AIDS drugs, a dramatic improvement on the 5 million who were getting treatment in 2010. “Despite the good news, we should not take a victory lap yet,” said Hohlfelder. She highlighted several threats to current progress, including a $3b shortfall in the funds needed each year to control HIV around the world. “We want to see bold new funding from a more diversified base, including more from African domestic budgets,” she said. ONE also noted that HIV is increasingly concentrated among hard-to-reach populations such as injecting drug users, gay men and sex workers - groups who are often stigmatised and have trouble accessing treatment and prevention services.",{},"['treatment', 'world', 'hiv', 'pandemic', 'virus', 'aids', 'million', 'infected', 'number', 'end', 'beginning']","The world has finally reached “the beginning of the end” of the AIDS pandemic that has infected and killed millions in the past 30 years, according to a leading campaign group fighting HIV.

‘I don’t want my daughter to grow up ignominiously’,Bonded sex workers in Bangladesh have tough choices,,2017-05-21,Dhaka Tribune,"A life of extreme poverty Essential services Reshmi* (name changed) says she doesn’t enjoy her evening walks in a nice, green park of Dhaka like others do. While a stroll in the park may be a healthy choice for most, for Reshmi it is about survival - she walks every day in the park to hunt clients who will pay to have sex. “People come in the park to enjoy the greenery of it and have fresh air but for me, I come here for my ignominious livelihood, against my will, so that my daughter can continue her studies,” says Reshmi. A young bonded sex worker, Reshmi turns 25 this year, but her life changed at the age of four when her father died in a road accident. “I was living with my family at Khalishpur in Khulna district. My father died in a road accident when I was only four years old and it was very hard for my mother to arrange meals, three times a day, let alone study. I never got a chance for schooling.”She continues to share her miserable childhood - “to handle the situation, my mother sent me to Dhaka for domestic work and I had been doing that for a few years. But when I turned 13, my mother forced me to get married to an older man, without my consent. I didn’t want to get married at that age so I escaped with a friend of mine, to change my luck. But worse came to worst, and I was trapped in sex slavery. Since then I am part of this trade,” Reshmi says. After attending to three or four clients a day at a hotel near the park, Reshmi gets back to her little, damp house at midnight to catch a few hours of sleep. The house is only rented for nights at double the regular price, and on condition that she cannot show her face there during the day. She hardly gets the time to shower or have breakfast before its time for her to leave. As a hapless sex worker, she was lured by the promise of a better life by a man she married when she was 18, only to later find he was a human trafficker who planned to sell her across the border. At the time, Reshmi was pregnant and that actually saved her from being trafficked. She became the mother of a beautiful daughter at 19 and was instantly abandoned by her husband. Sh had not a single penny with which to feed her daughter and had to return to the sex trade again. “Many a time, I faced gang rape and sex without condoms. I was heavily injured at times and managed to escape from being murdered. But I want to give my daughter an education, a good life. That’s why I need money and have to keep myself safe from diseases,” Reshmi says.As there was no one to look after her baby during work hours, Reshmi was struggling with her daughter. She had no place to rest from dawn to dusk, except under the open sky, and no option of getting a health check. Then she came across the ‘Drop-in-Center’ of Save the Children where she is now enlisted for essential services. In the centre, Reshmi is learning different life skills, getting basic education and receiving counselling on safer sex and HIV prevention. The lessons enable her to remain in good health to earn her livelihood and increases her confidence to negotiate with the clients for condom use. There is also a ‘Hotline’ and ‘Community Squad’ introduced by Save the Children and its partner organisation for the sex workers for any kind of help, like when faced with violence. “I wanted to test my blood to be sure about HIV following the advice I got from the drop-in-centre. The test was negative. I go there everyday now. I have learned what to do in emergencies and how to seek police assistance. It helped me save my life,” said Reshmi. It is estimated that there are 1,02,260 female sex workers in Bangladesh who are at high risk of HIV. Save the Children and its partner organisations have brought 26,000 female sex workers under their coverage to provide essential services through 43 drop-in-centres in 26 districts and bring them under universal health access with financial support from the Global Fund. While its uncertain if Reshmi and her daughter can live a happy life in the near future, there is always hope from Save the Children that armed with an education, her daughter will be able to choose a different path.",{},"['life', 'children', 'save', 'ignominiously', 'mother', 'park', 'daughter', 'reshmi', 'dont', 'grow', 'day', 'sex', 'workers']","She became the mother of a beautiful daughter at 19 and was instantly abandoned by her husband.

"As Rohingya numbers surge, Bangladesh worries about various diseases breaking out",The Rohingya have faced health-related discrimination in Myanmar for decades,,2017-10-20,Dhaka Tribune,"A large number of the Rohingya who have entered Bangladesh since late August, and thousands of others who continue to cross the border, are sick – many suffering from diseases like Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and Polio. About 40% of these new refugees, officially 582,000 so far, are staying in cramped camps while others are living under the open sky or in makeshift camps in Cox’s Bazar. A scarcity of safe water and sanitation facilities has triggered fears among health experts that the living conditions could lead to outbreaks of diseases. An outbreak will be catastrophic – both for the refugees and their host communities. The Rohingya have faced health-related discrimination in Myanmar for decades, where they are denied citizenship and basic rights. A large section of the community had already been suffering from various diseases before they came to Bangladesh because of malnutrition, unhealthy living conditions and a lack of access to healthcare. Bangladeshi health experts say they have identified four major diseases – Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Polio and Aids – in the new batch of refugees. Experts say the diseases will spread if the Rohingya are not kept in a particular area. They warn that germs from coughs, flux, used injections, human filth, garbage and water and air pollution would spread quickly if the living conditions are not improved. Bangladesh could see the outbreak of cholera, tuberculosis, malaria and measles if the refugees are not immediately treated. Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong and the Chittagong Hill Tracts will be the worst affected areas during such events, health experts say. Fifteen percent of the new arrivals are suffering from diarrhoea, government data show. The World Health Organisation, in a recent report, warned that there could be an outbreak of water-borne and infectious diseases among the Rohingya that would also affect the locals. The government is providing healthcare services to the Rohingya. Under the supervision of Ministry of Health, the Director General of Health Service (DGHS) is working with the Armed Forces Division, UN bodies, and international and local NGOs to deliver health services in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. On its website, the DGHS said 74 static health centers – 25 run by government, 10 by army and 39 by NGOs – were providing health facilities to the refugees. Forty-three mobile medical teams and 231 vaccination teams are working there. Gawher Nayeem Wahra, a teacher at Dhaka University’s Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies, noted that Myanmar did not have an immunisation programme for the Rohingya. He warned that as a result, the latest influx include many Rohingya suffering from malaria, tuberculosis, and polio. “The diseases will spread if they get scattered across the country. It is a big public health issue,” he said. “Eventually, the refugees will be needed to be shifted to Ukhiya and Teknaf where clean water is not easily available.” The government, with the assistance of local and foreign health service providers, is trying to vaccinate the Rohingya but logistical problems mean a large number of the refugees have been left untreated. The infected refugees - who are being treated at hospitals in Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar - also pose a threat to other patients as some of them are suffering from infectious diseases. Among them, government officials say they have identified 51 HIV positive Rohingya patients. Cox’s Bazar Civil Surgeon Dr Mohammad Abdus Salam said 682,000 refugees had been given cholera vaccinations by the government while various local and international organisations have vaccinated another 175,000 Rohingya. Salam told the Dhaka Tribune on Thursday that they had detected 850 Hepatitis patients and about 50 measles-affected Rohingya, who are now being treated. “The Rohingya are suffering from water-borne diseases,” he said. “We found that about 50,000 are infected by flu-type germs while about 15,000 are suffering from skin diseases. About 10,000 were treated for various injuries.” Chittagong Medical College Hospital’s Dr Dev Pratim Barua said: “Rohingyas are suffering from various infectious diseases that may spread among other refugees and locals if we fail to keep them in a special zone under proper monitoring.” His colleague Dr Pranab Kumar Chowdhury warned that Bangladesh would have to pay the price if the sick refugees were not kept under proper surveillance. “As 90% Rohingya are illiterate and unaware about health concerns, there is a huge risk that infectious diseases would spread,” he said. CMCH Director Brig Gen Jalal Uddin Ahmad said: “We opened a separate ward for the Rohingya at the hospital’s outdoor section on October 1 to prevent spread of diseases.” Civil Surgeon Salam said they had taken similar initiatives at Cox’s Bazar Sadar Hospital.

Superbugs linked to 80% of deaths in Bangladeshi ICUs,"Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistance",,2019-04-24,Dhaka Tribune,"Representational photo: Bigstock Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial resistant superbugs could be responsible for up to 80% of deaths in intensive care units (ICUs) in Bangladesh, a senior doctor has warned. Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of Pharmacology Department at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), told the Telegraph that approximately 900 patients were admitted to the unit in 2018. Of them, 400 died, he added. Dr Sayedur said out of those deaths around 80% were attributed to a bacterial or fungal infection that was resistant to antibiotics, reports The Telegraph. According to the article, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) because of: poor adherence to antibiotic treatment, the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals, self-medication, and illegal over-the-counter access to antibiotics. The chairman of BSMMU’s Pharmacology Department said: ""Most patients [that die] come from public ICUs where there is strictly no AMR surveillance. “And this is the generator of antibacterial resistance."" He said: ""There should be more security...they [antibiotics] should not be available over the counter and others should only be dispensed at hospitals."" According to a study published in the European Journal of Scientific Research, in 2015, over one-third of patients in Bangladesh surveyed were given antibiotics by people without authorization. The Chairman of the BSMMU Microbiology Department, Prof Ahmed Abu Saleh told a Bangladeshi news daily that the situation was not like this about 10 years ago. He said around 70% of deaths across all ICUs in Bangladesh could be put down to superbugs. “Basically, there is no new antibiotic in the pipeline for future use. At the same time, the available antibiotic drugs are losing their effectiveness — which has made the scenario more dangerous,” Prof Ahmed said. Around 10 million people could die, annually, by 2050 from AMR if effective measures are not taken regarding it, a report warned in 2016. That figure is higher than the total number of people who died from cancer, diabetes, and diarrhoea in 2018. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally over time as microorganisms undergo genetic changes. As microorganisms evolve, antibiotics can become less effective at treating an infection. In South Asia, the prescription of incorrect or poor quality medicine leads to antimicrobial resistance. In many countries, stringent controls over prescribing medicine to animals are not upheld. Antibiotics intended for human use are also given to animals in a bid to fatten them quickly and thus generate more profit. A study in Chittagong, found that over half of poultry chickens were infected with multi-drug resistant bacteria. However, the emergence of AMR superbugs is not just a problem for South Asia, rather a worldwide issue. A 2017 study in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases confirmed that the malaria parasite—in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam—had developed resistance to the artemisinin-based combination therapy prescribed to treat the disease. Around the world, resistant strains of the HIV virus are thought to account for between 10% and 20% of infections and up to 40% of those are from re-starting medical treatment.",{},"['linked', 'resistance', 'resistant', 'patients', 'antibiotics', 'bangladesh', 'superbugs', 'study', 'deaths', 'department', 'amr', '80', 'icus', 'bangladeshi']","Representational photo: BigstockBangladesh, India, and Pakistan are seen as drivers of antimicrobial resistanceAntimicrobial resistant superbugs could be responsible for up to 80% of deaths in intensive care units (ICUs) in Bangladesh, a senior doctor has warned.

Imran Khan makes first visit to Iran,Khan began his two-day visit with a stop in the north-eastern holy city of Mashhad,,2019-04-22,Dhaka Tribune,"President Hassan Rouhani, right, and Pakistani PM Imran Khan giving a press conference in the capital Tehran on April 22, 2019 AFP Khan began his two-day visit with a stop in the north-eastern holy city of Mashhad Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan began his first official visit to Iran on Sunday for talks set to focus on strengthening ties and countering terrorism, state media reported. Khan began his two-day visit with a stop in the north-eastern holy city of Mashhad, Irans second largest and home to the shrine of Imam Reza who is revered by Shia Muslims, state television said in a live broadcast. After visiting the shrine, Khan was to fly to Tehran where on Monday he is expected to hold talks with President Hassan Rouhani and other top officials. The state-run IRNA news agency said Khans trip was expected to help ""develop ties between the two countries, especially those related to regional cooperation in fighting terrorism and safeguarding borders."" Iran and Pakistan share a long border that runs nears the volatile south-eastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan which has witnessed over the years numerous attacks on Irans security forces. In March, Rouhani demanded Pakistan act ""decisively against anti-Iranian terrorists"", following a February attack that killed 27 members of the elite Revolutionary Guards in Sistan-Baluchistan. Iran has said a Pakistani suicide bomber was behind the attack, which was claimed by the Sunni jihadist group, Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which Tehran says operates mostly out of bases in Pakistan. Khans visit to Iran, the first since he took office last year, also comes days after gunmen killed 14 members of Pakistans security forces in the Balochistan province. On Saturday Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Islamabad had evidence the ""terrorist outfits"" that carried out the attack have ""training and logistic camps inside Iranian areas bordering Pakistan.""

Toward an AIDS-free generation,"Young people must be treated with dignity, respect and without moral judgement, regardless of whether or not they use drugs, who they have sex with and why, or whether they are HIV positive or not
        	As the world’s population continues to increase we are seeing the rise of the largest population of young people that the world has ever known",,2013-10-22,Dhaka Tribune,"As the world’s population continues to increase we are seeing the rise of the largest population of young people that the world has ever known. UNAIDS envisages an AIDS-free generation, but it is young people who must, and will, make this vision a reality. As UN Day draws near, it is important to highlight young people as the change-makers that they are, as the greatest hope for getting to zero. That’s “Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths.” Bangladesh is a country that has low HIV prevalence, but continues to be high risk. This means that demographic factors such as population density, poverty, gender inequality and porous national borders remain challenges to the AIDS epidemic. HIV prevalence in Bangladesh remains low at 0.01% of the general population; however, some features of the HIV epidemic in Bangladesh warrant more attention. The Global AIDS Report 2013 identified Bangladesh as one of four countries in the Asia Pacific region where the rate of new HIV infection increased by over 25% between 2001 and 2011, and that young people (aged 15-24 years) account for an estimated 50% of all new HIV infections compared with 40% worldwide, revealing that young people are more important than ever for HIV prevention in Bangladesh. A combination of appropriate education and services for young people are the first steps toward HIV prevention and eradication. When young people receive correct, complete information about HIV and AIDS they gain the power to make informed decision with regards to their sexual health and behaviour. Yet only 17.7% of young people in Bangladesh are estimated to have comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention and a fewer proportion access to lifesaving services. The ever present challenge to HIV prevention continues to be limited access to HIV prevention information and services that are tailored to the unique needs of young people, particularly sexual and reproductive health and HIV treatment services. Moreover, educating people early on in life helps people to avoid unsafe behaviours and scenarios where they may be at risk of HIV infection. Not only does HIV education and awareness helps to defuse the stigma and discrimination facing people who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, or are living with HIV, but it is also vital in enabling people to access services. Without access to services for testing and treatment, people are unable to learn about their HIV status and consequently unable to protect themselves and others against infection. Services that incorporate the unique needs of young people are especially important, because young people have different needs with regards to information, counselling, testing, condoms, harm-reduction strategies and care for sexually transmitted infections including relationships than others. The perceptions of others around being a young person, whether they be perceived as a victim, a deviant, or other, can influence the behaviour of a young person and have unintended consequences. Young people must be treated with dignity, respect and without moral judgement, regardless of whether or not they use drugs, who they have sex with and why, or whether they are HIV positive or not. In doing so, systems that protect them from abuse, exploitation and violence should be enabled and strengthened. HIV is everyone’s business and more young people need to be engaged in the conversation about HIV prevention, treatment, and care for the benefit of all. Around the world, collective voices and community action has proven to be vital in defusing the stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV and AIDS. The onus of reliable information, attitudes that transform social stigma, and the accessibility of services and support depend on community and religious leaders, schools, parents and young people. Young people can and will be the driving force for Getting to Zero, but HIV prevention education and services by all are the first steps to empowering young people as change-makers for our future.",{},"['aidsfree', 'generation', 'access', 'information', 'young', 'hiv', 'zero', 'bangladesh', 'prevention', 'services', 'population', 'treatment']","UNAIDS envisages an AIDS-free generation, but it is young people who must, and will, make this vision a reality.

Imran Khan: No militants will be allowed to attack from Pakistani soil,Pakistan faces growing international pressure to rein in Islamist groups that carry out attacks in neighbouring India,,2019-03-08,Dhaka Tribune,"Imran Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party, speaks with a Reuters correspondent during an interview at his home in the hills of Bani Gala on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan Reuters Pakistan faces growing international pressure to rein in Islamist groups that carry out attacks in neighbouring India Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said no militant group would be allowed to operate from Pakistani soil to carry out attacks abroad, days after his government announced a sweeping crackdown against Islamist militant organisations. Pakistan faces growing international pressure to rein in Islamist groups that carry out attacks in neighbouring India. One such attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir on February 14, claimed by the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Pakistan-based group, killed 40 Indian paramilitary police and led to clashes between the nuclear-armed rivals as India retaliated. Both countries carried out aerial bombing missions last week and even fought a brief dogfight over Kashmir before tensions cooled. But the United States, Britain, and many other nations are urging Pakistan to act against anti-India militant groups. Pakistan has a history of using Islamist groups to pursue foreign policy aims in the region, but it has denied Indian accusations it actively supports militants fighting Indian forces in Indias part of Muslim-majority Kashmir. On Monday, Pakistan announced a new crackdown against militants and by Thursday, 182 religious schools run by banned groups had been seized, and more than 120 people detained. ""This government will not allow Pakistans land to be used for any kind of outside terrorism,"" Khan said while addressing a rally in southern Pakistan. ""God willing, you will see that a new era is emerging."" Pakistani governments have in the past made similar pledges to stop militant attacks being launched from its soil, notably in early 2002, after a raid by Pakistani-based militants on Indias parliament brought the two countries to the brink of war. Crackdowns have been launched with fanfare but faded out after a while, with the proscribed groups able to survive and continue their operations. Given the history, India has been sceptical about Pakistans latest steps to dismantle militant groups, with Indian officials calling the action cosmetic. But Khan said there was a huge desire to build a peaceful and stable Pakistan. ""We will not allow any militant group to function in our country now,"" he said. Pakistani officials say this crackdown is part of a long-planned drive and not a response to Indian anger. The South Asian neighbours have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over Kashmir which they both claim in full but rule in part.",{},"['pakistan', 'allowed', 'khan', 'groups', 'islamist', 'soil', 'attack', 'kashmir', 'group', 'indian', 'militant', 'pakistani', 'militants', 'imran', 'attacks']","Pakistan faces growing international pressure to rein in Islamist groups that carry out attacks in neighbouring India.

Separatist gunmen kill 14 bus passengers in Pakistan,"The attackers, who numbered around two dozen, were wearing uniforms from the paramilitary Frontier Corps",,2019-04-18,Dhaka Tribune,"At least 14 bus passengers were killed in an ambush by unknown armed men in the southwest of Pakistan on Thursday Twitter The attackers, who numbered around two dozen, were wearing uniforms from the paramilitary Frontier Corps Gunmen killed at least 14 people after forcing them to disembark from buses in Pakistans restive Balochistan province, officials said Thursday. The attackers, who numbered around two dozen, were wearing uniforms from the paramilitary Frontier Corps, provincial home secretary Haider Ali told AFP. They ""stopped buses on the Makran Coastal Highway and gunned down 14 people"", he said, adding that the four vehicles were travelling to the port megacity of Karachi from the coastal town of Ormara. A naval official and a coast guard member were among those killed, Ali said. All the victims are believed to be Pakistani. Provincial home minister Mir Zia Langov told AFP a full-scale investigation had been launched into the attack and to track down the gunmen, who he said had fled the scene. ""Such incidents are intolerable and we will not spare the terrorists who carried out this dastardly attack,"" he said. Prime Minster Imran Khan also condemned the killings in a statement from his office. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which came less than a week after a suicide blast in provincial capital Quetta killed 20 people. 14 passengers reportedly forced off a bus on Makran Coastal Highway in Balochistan and shot dead early Thursday. In 2015, gunmen disguised as #Pakistan security officials killed 22 passengers after forcing them off buses travelling on the southern coast https://t.co/jdDzGbelzR — Mehreen Zahra-Malik (@mehreenzahra) April 18, 2019 Poorest province Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistans largest and poorest province, as well as the site of Islamist, sectarian and separatist insurgencies. The Islamic State group is also active in the province, and claimed last weeks attack targeting ethnic Shia Hazaras in a fruit market in Quetta. The Pakistani military has been targeting insurgencies in the province since 2004, and has been repeatedly accused by international rights groups of abuses there. It denies the allegations. Balochistan is also the site of the flagship project of the multi-billion dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The massive infrastructure project seeks to connect the western Chinese province of Xinjiang with the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar in Balochistan. But it has also drawn its share of attacks, particularly by Baloch separatists who have long complained that residents of the province do not receive a fair share of profits from the project. Violence in Pakistan has dropped significantly since the countrys deadliest-ever militant attack, an assault on a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar in 2014 that killed more than 150 people -- most of them children.

Imran Khan hints at further cabinet changes after 'batting order' shuffle,Pakistan is on the brink of signing up for its 13th International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout since the late 1980s,,2019-04-20,Dhaka Tribune,"Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan attends talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping (not pictured) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, November 2, 2018 Reuters Pakistan is on the brink of signing up for its 13th International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout since the late 1980s Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday that he would not hesitate to make more changes to his cabinet if required a day after a major reshuffle that saw the appointment of a new finance minister and nine other ministerial switches. The cabinet shakeup, which comes eight months after Khan took office, included the replacement of Finance Minister Asad Umar, who has been a close ally to Khan for many years, with Abdul Hafeez Shaikh in a renamed role to steer the country out of worsening economic turmoil. Pakistan is on the brink of signing up for its 13th International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout since the late 1980s in a bid to stave off a balance of payments crisis and ease ballooning current account and fiscal deficits.

Shaikh, who served as finance minister from 2010-2013 under the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party when it was in power, has been appointed as ""Adviser on Finance"" but will be heading the finance ministry once again. In Pakistan it is common for financial experts to be given the title of ""adviser"", rather than federal minister, to head the finance ministry when they are not a sitting member of parliament. Umar has been leading negotiations with the IMF but faced criticism over a worsening economic outlook on his watch, with inflation at a five-year high and the rupee currency down about 35% since December 2017. The central bank last month cut growth estimates, forecasting the economy to expand 3.5 to 4% in the 12 months to the end of June, well short of a government target of 6.2%. The IMF paints a gloomier picture, predicting growth of 2.9% in 2019 and 2.8% next year. In a speech laden with cricket metaphors, Khan, who led Pakistans cricket team to World Cup triumph in 1992, said such changes were part of good leadership.

Pakistani rights group says Balochleader killed by police,"The group, which was founded a year ago to protest against the death of a Pashtun man killed by police in the southern port of Karachi",,2019-02-04,Dhaka Tribune,"Picture of Arman Loni Collected The group, which was founded a year ago to protest against the death of a Pashtun man killed by police in the southern port of Karachi Authorities in Pakistans Baluchistan province said on Sunday they had launched an investigation into the death of a regional leader of a Pakistani civil rights group, who died in what his movement called a ""targeted attack"" by police at a sit-in. Arman Loni died on Saturday after police tried to break up a four-day demonstration in the city of Loralai by the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, which stages demonstrations nationwide against violence and disappearances carried out by the state. A police spokesman said Loni had died of a heart attack following clashes between protesters and police. But Mohsin Dawar, a member of parliament and founding member of PTM, said the police had singled Loni out and deliberately beat him to death because of his role as a leader of the group. ""It was a targeted attack on him by police, I think his neck was broken and this was confirmed in the post-mortem,"" Dawar told Reuters, adding that he was killed for his ""association with PTM."" The group, which was founded a year ago to protest against the death of a Pashtun man killed by police in the southern port of Karachi, regularly draws thousands of protesters to its demonstrations against state violence. It has called nationwide protests for Tuesday to highlight the killing of Loni. The Baluchistan chief minister has ordered an inquiry into the killing. Both the Baluchistan home minister and information minister said they had no knowledge of how he died. PTM blames the Pakistani military and other state organs for what it says are forced disappearances resulting in thousands of unresolved missing persons cases, primarily from the ethnic Pashtun region bordering Afghanistan. Dawar and fellow lawmaker Ali Wazir, both PTM founders who were elected to parliament in July, were initially barred from entering Baluchistan by security officials and had to use ""alternate routes"" to make it to Lonis funeral, Dawar said.

Tuberculosis cases in Bangladesh increasing,"'As we are conducting screenings using better equipment this year, we are being able to detect more cases'",,2017-03-24,Dhaka Tribune,"WHO is currently also working with NTP on drafting the protocol for a drug resistance survey (DRS) planned for this year. The results of DRS will be able to provide a better understanding of the national situation and the trend of drug resistance to TB in the country A National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP) report states that the percentage of children infected with TB rose from 4% in 2015 to 4.3% in 2016 and the total number of TB patients increased from 57% to 61% between 2015 and 2016. The report, which is based on projects conducted by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), was released on Thursday during a press conference held at the National Press Club in Dhaka. DGHS Microbacterial Diseases Control Programme Director and Line Director (TB and Leprosy) Rouseli Haq said the use of modern equipment had helped detect this increasing number. Saila Islam, head of Brac’s TB project, concurred, saying: “As we are conducting screenings using better equipment this year, we are being able to detect more cases.” However, NTP officials said children generally comprise 10% of the total number of patients found and the fact that the current number is still as low as 4.3% is worrisome as some of the screenings may have failed to detect TB cases. Bangladesh, which is listed among the 30 high TB burden countries, has an annual occurrence of 225 out of every 1,00,000 people and, on average, 45 out of every 1,00,000 die annually because of tuberculosis. According to WHO Global TB report 2016, however, the number of new annual TB cases is a little higher at 362,000.Until last year, a total of 223,922 people were detected with tuberculosis, including 9,700 multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. WHO is providing technical support to authorities to strengthen its activities in addressing the challenges of TB/HIV, MDR-TB and the use of new technologies. According to the WHO report, Bangladesh is the first country to introduce shorter treatment regimen for MDR-TB and has achieved a high cure rate (75%) for MDR-TB patients. WHO is currently also working with NTP on drafting the protocol for a drug resistance survey (DRS) planned for this year. The results of DRS will be able to provide a better understanding of the national situation and the trend of drug resistance to TB in the country. Shamila Sharma, communication officer of the WHO regional office, said the annual decline in TB incidence – which is currently between 1.5% and 2% – is insufficient and needs to be scaled up to at least 10% to 15% for the countries and the region to meet the End TB targets. The global targets seek to reduce TB mortality by 90% and incidence by 80% within 2030.",{},"['tb', 'report', 'resistance', 'patients', 'increasing', 'bangladesh', 'cases', 'drug', 'mdrtb', 'national', 'tuberculosis', 'number', 'ntp']","WHO is currently also working with NTP on drafting the protocol for a drug resistance survey (DRS) planned for this year.

The journey of Bangla,The Bengali language we speak has a rich history,,2019-02-20,Dhaka Tribune,"Words to live by MEHEDI HASAN The Bengali language we speak has a rich history The people of ancient Bengal did not differ much from the present day people in their food habits, social rites, and rituals. Their main food at the time was rice, fish, meat, vegetables, fruit, milk, curd, butter, oil, and so on. Delicious food items were served on the occasion of festivals. Different kinds of homemade cakes and sweet rolls were also prepared. Water was made fragrant by mixing camphor in it, and spiced betel leaves were served after meals. The common dress for men at that time was the dhoti and women generally wore sari. The people of East Bengal used to feast on hilsa. The language of the original inhabitants of Bengal was Austric. This language gradually faded away after the coming of the Aryans. The name of the language of the Aryans was Vedic language. The scholars turned the Vedic language into a language of literature. As the old language was reformed, this new language was named as the Sanskrit language from which the Bengali language originated. The modern scholars, however, have not accepted this view. In the ancient time, the common people did not use this language, instead using a language called “Prakrita Bhasha.” As time passed, changes began to come over the language. It gained excellence and quality through the writing of books. Two languages were born from it -- “Pali” and “Apabhransha.” The language of the common people, however, remained as Prakrita. The Sanskrit language has been used most in Bengal during the reigns of the Pala and the Sena dynasties. As a result, Bengali language did not develop much during that time. The cultivation of the Bengali language increased later, during the Medieval Age. In Karachi, representatives of East Bengal attending a Pakistani educational conference opposed Urdu as the only national language. The demand for Bengali as one of the state languages gathered the spontaneous support of the Bengali civil servants, academics, students, and various groups of people. Several members of the provincial assembly, including some ministers, were reportedly active in supporting the movement. By the end of February 1948, the controversy had spilled over onto the streets. The East Pakistan student league, founded in the first week of January led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was at the forefront. The government shortly imposed Section 144 on February 20, prohibiting any gathering or assembly. Students gathered at the premises of the Medical College Hostel to protest, and at one point the police opened fire on the students. The bullets took many young lives, making a sacrifice of Salam, Barkat, Rafiq, Shafiq, Jabbar, and others. In protest of the shootings, a strike was observed all over the country on February 22. There was more shooting that day at a demonstration near the High Court, and more protesters killed and injured. Many more were arrested, while the military was deployed in different parts of the city. The actions on February 21, 1952, proved that a nation could not silence a brave civilized nation if they had a unifying language like Bangla. This movement ultimately ended in the adoption of Bangla as one of the state languages of Pakistan in 1956. In line with the spirit of the Language Movement, Bangladesh achieved its long cherished freedom through a nine-month long armed struggle under the charismatic leadership of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hence, in the life of every Bengali, February 21 is a day of grief, strength, glory, words, and silence.

Education: A hope for Banishanta sex workers,"Amid the bleakness of their lives, sex workers at Banishanta Brothel in Mongla, Bagerhat have something that motivates them to survive – their children’s education",,2016-09-24,Dhaka Tribune,"Despite being born in the brothel, sex workers’ children get opportunities to go to school and sometimes even pursue higher studies. “At least a dozen children of our women have successfully pursued higher education. Many other children are going to schools nearby. Education is a priority here,” said Julekha Begum, deputy sardarni (chief) of the brothel. World Vision, an NGO that works for children’s welfare, provides support for children’s education at Banishanta. In addition, the children have access to the local government primary schools. “At present, 70 children born to the sex workers in the brothel go to Ghoragangmari Government Primary School here. We try to ensure that all children from there get access to education. We often visit the brothel to check if any child has dropped out of school,” Md Masum Billah, education officer in Dacope upazila of Khulna, told the Dhaka Tribune. Visiting the brothel, this correspondent learnt that the sex workers usually get families in the nearby villages to provide lodgings to their children. Villagers charge a monthly fee of Tk1,500-2,000 for each child to cover their academic and other costs. “But there are some children who still live inside the brothel,” said Julekha. She also told the story of Surobhi (not her real name), one of the children born in the brothel who scored GPA 5 in her Secondary School Certificate exams last year. “She is now going to a college in Khulna city,” Julekha said. “There are many others like her.” Asked about the birth registration of these children, she said: “It happens through a mutual understanding between the sex worker and the customer. Sometimes, customers get attached to the children and demand that the sex workers give them up. “In cases like this, a customer takes all responsibility of the mother and provides his name as the father in birth registration. They become a family without wedlock.” But there are many cases where the fathers lose interest in their families after a few years and abandon them, Julekha added. “What is good about these children is that they are very understanding about their mothers’ situation,” she told this correspondent. “When they grow up and begin to understand what their mothers do for a living and the stigma attached to it, they show compassion and try to help their mothers, instead of turning their backs on them.” Asked if there has been an instance of a child entering the sex trade, Julekha denied vehemently. “It has never happened in this brothel’s history. We only give shelter to floating sex workers who need support,” she said. “If any sex worker is found recruiting her daughter in this profession, we expel them from the brothel.” What if they come back? “We take them in. It is our policy to provide shelter to all sex workers.”",{},"['children', 'school', 'child', 'julekha', 'mothers', 'hope', 'education', 'brothel', 'sex', 'banishanta', 'workers', 'told']","Despite being born in the brothel, sex workers’ children get opportunities to go to school and sometimes even pursue higher studies. “At present, 70 children born to the sex workers in the brothel go to Ghoragangmari Government Primary School here.

MSF holds symposium on sexual and gender-based violence care,The need for medical and psychological care has to be met to help the victims with their trauma,,2017-07-27,Dhaka Tribune,"The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hosted a symposium on Thursday attended by stakeholders of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) care from different organisations. The conference focused on services such as medical and legal aid that can be accessed by women who face SGBV. It emphasised on a “comprehensive approach on learning from different models of SGBV programmes based on current experiences and challenges.” Specialists in the field of SGBV discussed the various challenges women face in different strata of economic classes – especially women who are domestic violence survivors, slum-dwellers, sex workers and residents of disaster-prone areas. The symposium aimed to help different players, including governmental authorities and relevant partners, working in SGBV care “to understand overlapping dimensions of the topic for sustainable solutions.” The event began with a welcome address by MSF Head of Mission, Pavlo Kolovos. It also emphasised the need to spread awareness about health care and psychosocial and legal services to women who usually do not know where to go to seek help. Additional Director of Department of Women Affairs under the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs Shahnowas Dilruba Khan took part in the symposium as the chief guest. She said: “The collaboration between government and non-government organisations will strengthen the endeavour to achieve the SDG on gender equality and equity.” The presentations were followed by a panel chaired by MSF Medical Coordinator in Bangladesh Dr Mitchell Sangma. The panel included specialists from One Stop Crisis Centre (OCC), ICDDR,B, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Department of Forensic Medicine of Dhaka Medical College. Senior Scientist in SBGV at ICDDR,B Dr Ruchira Tabassum stressed on the need of “prevention” from sexual violence which requires a massive social change. She also urged the government organisations to collaborate with NGOs to make such prevention effective. According to Kolovos: “Sexual and gender-based violence must be addressed as a very significant factor of any society. The need for medical and psychological care has to be met to help the victims with their trauma."" ""MSF is working in Kamrangirchar, assisting those who have difficulty to access other SGBV care. Our aim is to ensure free and timely access to good quality medical care as well as to improve the victims’ dignity. A sustained, long-term, and broad-based effort is needed to assist both victims and those at risk,” he added. MSFs Kamrangirchar urban slum project started in 2010. They have been actively working towards improving womens access to reproductive health care, enhancing access to medical services for survivors of sexual and domestic violence, and providing primary health care for factory workers. SGBV Cluster Coordinator of UNFPA Saba Zariv discussed how their teams provide essential psychological and medical help to survivors in disaster-prone areas. The One-Stop Crisis Centre also provides necessary services to victims of sexual violence. Project Director of Multi-Sectoral Programme on Violence against Women Dr Abdul Hossain, who also supervises and coordinates the activities of OCC, said women with SGBV complaints can very easily access their helpline by calling 109. Dr Sangma concluded the panel by asking vital questions regarding SGBV: “Are there still victims of rape, domestic violence, and HIV who are seeking health care and counselling? Are there still girls who report violence to police to seek justice? Can an adolescent boy learn in school that violence against women is unacceptable? Can the media respect the confidentiality and dignity of survivors?” “Until the answer to all of these is yes, we have a long way to go,” he added. The event ended with a vote of thanks by MSF Project Coordinator Arunn Jegan.",{},"['violence', 'holds', 'symposium', 'survivors', 'sexual', 'access', 'women', 'care', 'sgbv', 'medical', 'msf', 'genderbased', 'victims']","The international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) hosted a symposium on Thursday attended by stakeholders of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) care from different organisations.

Migrant workers’ dreams end in body bags,"Bangladesh received 33,000 bodies of migrant workers since 2005; workload, poor living conditions, heart disease blamed for deaths",,2017-12-18,Dhaka Tribune,"The medical issues Delay in repatriating bodies The hard-earned money sent home by millions of migrant workers is one of the biggest sources of foreign currency for Bangladesh. Expatriate workers remitted around $14.93 billion last year. As hundreds of thousands leave the country every year to try their luck, thousands also return, albeit in coffins and body bags. Bodies of 33,112 migrant workers have been received between 2005 and November this year, government figures show. But the number of deaths is believed to be higher as many workers are buried abroad. A large number of these deaths are attributed to heart attacks and stroke. Many of the victims are young. As many as 11.39 million Bangladeshis have migrated between 1976 and 2017, according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET). Dhaka University’s international Relations Professor CR Abrar pointed out that everyone had to take extensive medical tests before they were permitted to work abroad. “This issue cannot be taken lightly,” he said. “We need to investigate and uncover the reasons why they are dying while working abroad even though they were medically fit before leaving the country.” Brac’s Migration Head Shariful Islam Hasan claimed that adverse working environment, excessive workload, poor living conditions, heart attack and stroke caused by mental stress were behind 94% of the migrant deaths. Some others are killed in accidents, commit suicide or are murdered, he added citing data he gathered when working as a reporter. In the first 11 months of this year, 3,154 bodies of migrant workers were received, according to Wage Earners Welfare Board (WEWB) of Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment. Shariful claimed that at least eight to 10 bodies were sent to Bangladesh daily. Many workers have been buried abroad after their deaths. One of the unfortunate victims was twenty-six-year-old Delwar Hossain, who went to Malaysia in 2013 to work at a palm oil farm. His employer claimed that he had died of a heart attack on January 29 this year. The pictures provided by Delwar’s employer showed his body lying under the bed. His family members alleged that he had been murdered. “He had some problems with a coworker. The foreman had beaten him several times after refusing to work extra hours. They did not let him eat or sleep properly,” his younger brother Abul Kalam Azad told the Dhaka Tribune. Before going abroad, a person needs to undergo many medical tests to determine whether he or she is suffering from a list of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Gulf Approved Medical Centers Association said an aspirant migrant worker needs to be tested for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, HCV, malaria, tuberculosis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, psychiatric diseases, neurological disorders and physical disabilities, among others. “Sometimes the employers claim their workers had committed suicide or mention heart failure or stroke as the cause of death to avoid paying compensation,” Prof Abrar noted. “When a family receives the body of loved ones it is normal that they do not investigate further. Last rites get the top priority.” Brac official Shariful emphasised ensuring the rights of the migrant workers, pointing out how the overseas employers violated labour law. The migrant workers are easily exploited, he said. They are under pressure to pay back loans they had taken before travelling abroad and the employers take advantage of their desperate mental state to force them to work extra hours with little pay. Shafiqul Islam, director of Wage Earners Welfare Board, said the migrant workers could inform the complaint cell. “When they inform us about the violence they face, we immediately inform our embassy or the concerned country to look into the matter and rescue our worker,” he said. Shafiqul said the government provided Tk35,000 to families of each dead worker when they receive the body in Dhaka. If the worker was legal, the family gets another Tk3 lakh. WEWB Assistant Director (Information and Public Relations) Zahid Anwar said that if family members of a deceased expatriate express doubt about the cause of death and apply for re-autopsy, the board forwards their plea to the concerned Bangladeshi embassy. ""But the family will have to apply before the body of the deceased arrives in Bangladesh. If the body reaches home, then the government of the employer country may reject the application,"" said Zahid. He, however, did not clarify if Bangladesh accepts, without contest, the cause of death as stated by the employer or what it does if the family’s claim contradicts that of the stated cause. Shafiqul also did not say anything about how the government ascertains the cause of death of migrant workers in cases such as that of Delwar. [caption id=""attachment_234581"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""] Fifteen Bangladeshi migrants who were held captive by Sunni militants in war-torn Iraq for 24 days finally returned home on July 19, 2014[/caption]It takes quite some time for the body of a migrant worker to be sent home, notably from Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh’s largest manpower export market. Prof CR Abrar pointed out that the time needed depended on the official processes of different countries. “Every country has different procedures and documentation processes. The delay in sending back bodies are probably because of communication gap or lack of proper documentation, or lack of coordination,” Abrar said. “Sending back the bodies should get the top priority at our missions.” WEWB Director Shafiqul said whenever they receive the news of a migrant worker’s death, they first take a written statement from the family on whether or not they want the body. “If they do, we forward the papers to the concerned embassy to take care of the repatriation process,” he said. Shafiqul said the process was lengthy in Saudi Arabia. “They conduct several inquiries to determine the cause of deaths. Sometimes it takes between two weeks and six months and sometimes more. It takes more time if it is a suicide case or accident death,” he added.",{},"['heart', 'bags', 'migrant', 'shafiqul', 'worker', 'family', 'death', 'abroad', 'cause', 'body', 'workers', 'end', 'dreams']","The medical issuesDelay in repatriating bodiesThe hard-earned money sent home by millions of migrant workers is one of the biggest sources of foreign currency for Bangladesh.

Daily coffee and chocolate helps to cure liver diseases,"Eating chocolate and drinking 3 or more cups of coffee everyday can lower levels of two common enzymes that are the markers of liver diseasesCoffee is a very popular, and so is chocolate",,2014-02-21,Dhaka Tribune,"Coffee is a very popular, and so is chocolate. Recently a study has found that both coffee and chocolate are good for liver especially when the liver is infected by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and HCV (Hepatitis C Virus). The study found that patients coinfected with HIV and HCV who reported eating chocolate daily and drinking three or more cups of coffee a day had lower levels of ALT and AST. AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) are the two common liver enzymes that are the markers representing the inflammation in the liver and we can know their level by blood tests. People with HIV and/or hepatitis C have routinely checked ALT and AST levels. An article published in the January 2014 issue of Journal of Hepatology describes how drinking more coffee and eating more chocolate may be associated with lower levels of liver enzymes in people living with HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). The key to these observations are the presence of polyphenols, or a type of anti-oxidant that have anti-inflammatory properties. Similar polyphenols are found in both coffee and chocolate, and it appears that higher levels of these anti-oxidants are what are lowering ALT and AST levels. The study showed that drinking three or more cups of coffee daily, and eating chocolate each day, were each associated with more normal levels of ALT. When combined, they represented a 40–50% lower lever of abnormal liver enzymes. Also drinking more coffee each day was associated with more normal AST levels. But researchers said these results need to be confirmed by further experimental and observational research.",{},"['levels', 'alt', 'drinking', 'liver', 'diseases', 'hiv', 'lower', 'coffee', 'cure', 'study', 'chocolate', 'daily', 'ast', 'helps']","Recently a study has found that both coffee and chocolate are good for liver especially when the liver is infected by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and HCV (Hepatitis C Virus).

Pakistan parliament elects Imran Khan as next PM,"Imran Khan has secured 176 votes, while his rival, Shahbaz Sharif of the ousted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), won 96 votes.",,2018-08-17,Dhaka Tribune,"A hand out image made available by the Pakistan National Assembly on August 13, 2018, shows. from left to right, Pakistans cricketer-turned politician and head of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party Imran Khan, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Khalid Maqbool , Sardar Akhtar Mengal and others taking the oath as Members of Parliament during the first session of the Parliament in Islamabad following general election AFP Imran Khan has secured 176 votes, while his rival, Shahbaz Sharif of the ousted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), won 96 votes. Pakistani lawmakers have endorsed Imran Khan as their next prime minister, ahead of a ceremony on Saturday that should see the World Cup cricket hero sworn in as leader of the nuclear-armed nation. Khan scraped together a simple majority in a confidence vote held in the lower house of parliament, three weeks after an election tainted by claims of military meddling and ballot rigging. A hand out image made available by the Pakistan National Assembly on August 13, 2018, shows Pakistans cricketer-turned politician and head of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party Imran Khan, taking the oath as a Member of Parliament during the first session of the Parliament in Islamabad following general election AFP ""Imran Khan has secured 176 votes,"" National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said after the vote, broadcast live from the lower house of parliament. He had needed 172 votes for a majority. His only rival, Shahbaz Sharif of the ousted Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), won 96 votes, Qaiser said, with some opposition parties including the third-largest Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) abstaining from the vote. The result brings him one step closer to ending decades of rotating leadership between the PML-N and the PPP, punctuated by periods of military rule. Khan, clad in a waistcoat and traditional white shalwar kameez garments, smiled broadly and could be seen wiping tears from his eyes while clutching prayer beads as the count was announced. He had appeared relaxed before the vote, smiling and shaking hands with other parliamentarians, including Sharif. The former cricketer, who captained Pakistan to World Cup victory in 1992, won the July 25 election but fell short of an outright majority, forcing him to partner with smaller parties and independents in order to form a government. Some television channels flashed archive images of Khan during his 1992 triumph as the vote was announced. The election was branded ""Pakistans dirtiest"", after widespread claims through the campaign that the powerful military was trying to fix the playing field against the PML-N and in Khans favour. Rival parties have alleged ""blatant"" vote-rigging, with several parliamentarians shouting protest slogans inside the assembly ahead of the vote. The army and Khan have denied the claims. The work begins Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party campaigned on promises to end widespread graft while building an ""Islamic welfare state"". The party has already formed a government in its stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and an alliance with regional parties in the southwestern province of Balochistan. It is expected to form a coalition government in powerful Punjab province, formerly a PML-N stronghold, in coming days. Sindh province remained in the hands of the PPP. PTI candidates were also voted speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly this week, putting Khan in a strong position to carry forward his legislative agenda. He will face myriad challenges including militant extremism, water shortages, and a booming population negating growth in the developing country, among others. Most pressing will be a looming economic crisis, with speculation that Pakistan will have to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. He will also have to contend with the same issue as many of his predecessors: how to maintain a balance of power in civil-military relations. In the West, Khan is often seen as a celebrity whose high-profile romances were tabloid fodder, but at home he cuts a more conservative persona as a devout Muslim who believes feminism has degraded motherhood. Known in Pakistan as ""Taliban Khan"" for his calls to hold talks with insurgents, he increasingly catered to religious hardliners during the campaign, spurring fears his leadership could embolden extremists.",{},"['party', 'province', 'pakistan', 'khan', 'election', 'votes', 'parliament', 'vote', 'pmln', 'elects', 'assembly', 'imran']","A hand out image made available by the Pakistan National Assembly on August 13, 2018, shows.

Adivasis demand equal allocation in national budget,Budget allocation in last 10 years is significantly low for the plain land Adivasis,,2019-05-16,Dhaka Tribune,"Speakers including former minister Rashed Khan Menon at the roundtable discussion titled Specific and inclusive budget on Wednesday in Dhaka Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Budget allocation in last 10 years is significantly low for the plain land Adivasis Leaders of the Adivasi community have demanded an equal allocation in the national budget, as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved unless the budget is inclusive. The demand was voiced during a roundtable discussion titled “Specific and inclusive budget,” at the Daily Star Centre on Wednesday. The discussion was jointly organized by Kapaeeng Foundation and Manusher Jonno Foundation, with support from UKAid. According to speakers at the discussion, the per capita allocation for Adivasis in the national budget is far lower than the national average. While the allocation for Adivasis was Tk200 per person, the national average was Tk11,229 per person. Keynote speaker and economist Prof MM Akas said: “One in every 54 people is an Adivasi who lives on the plains. In the current fiscal year, the budget allocation was Tk27,000 per capita. In the next fiscal year [2019-20] the budget may reach Tk5,00,000 crores, and the per capita allocation will reach Tk29,000. The Adivasis must demand their equal rights in the budget, and they must stay united to achieve this.” He also suggested the government introduce a district based budget, to help make government services more accessible for the Adivasis. Chief guest and member of parliament Rashed Khan Menon said: “To look after the Adivasis, the government should at least establish a division under the Ministry of Hill Tracts, if a separate ministry is not possible. The Adivasis should stay united and continue their movement.” Bangladesh Adivasi Forum General Secretary Sanjeeb Drong said: “A separate section must be included in the next budget speech. While a section on the Adivasis was in the budget speech 3-4 years ago, we have not seen it since. We hear of development, but are plagued by unemployment. We need equal rights in every sector.” Anisatul Fatema Uousuf said: “If we can include the most marginalized communities in the development process, then we can say we are on the track to achieving the SDGs. “A Tk200 per person allocation in the budget is terrible” she added. Adivasies constitute 2% of the total population of the country.

Mohakhali warehouse fire burns contraception meant for the poor,'The fire was brought under control at 8am with the help of 14 firefighting units',,2017-04-10,Dhaka Tribune,"The Directorate General of Family Planning warehouse in Mohakhali that stored contraceptives intended for HIV and STD prevention programmes has been severely damaged in a fire on Sunday. The fire broke out at 12:30am and took almost eight hours for firefighters to douse the fire completely. The source of the fire has yet to be determined. Duty Inspector of the Fire Service Mahmud Hasan said: “The fire was brought under control at 8am with the help of 14 firefighting units.” Although 14 units arrived at the site at night, only five of them remained from 4am till 8am working to douse the fire. Officer-in-Charge of Fire Service Headquarters Enayet Hossain said the reason why it took eight hours to douse the fire was because the source of water was far from the warehouse. “We had to alternate between filling the firetrucks with water and dousing the fire, which is why it took so long to bring it under control,” he said adding the warehouse housed some highly flammable goods including condoms which also exacerbated the problem. Hanifur Rahman, additional director (drugs and store) of the Directorate, said contraceptives, condoms and other HIV and STD medication was stored at the warehouse for nationwide distribution. There contraceptives were meant to be distributed in 12 brothels in Bangladesh but were being stored at the warehouse as the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP) ended in November last year. HIV activists and NGOs have been demanding the programme be resumed to stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases among sex workers. Director General of Health Services Professor Abul Kalam Azad told the Dhaka Tribune that they along with other stakeholders were working on resuming the programme. Three probe committees have been formed by the Family Planning Ministry and the DGFP to find the cause of the fire and estimate the financial loss from it. Director General of DGFP Mostafizur Rahman said they formed a five-member committee led by Ferdous Alam, director (IEM) also line director (IEC), to investigate the cause of the fire and another inventory committee was formed under Mohammad Sharif (MCH Services), also line director (MCRAH).

Shitalakshya in critical condition from pollution and encroachment,At least 344 factories are dumping wastes into the river everyday,,2019-05-16,Dhaka Tribune,"Shitalakshya River in dire condition from trash, pollution, chemical waste, and illegal structures in Narayanganj Dhaka Tribune At least 344 factories are dumping wastes into the river everyday The once bursting Shitalakshya is being rapidly polluted and its fish stocks are depleting as household and industrial wastes from hundreds of factories in Narayanganj are regularly dumped into the river. In a 2018 report, the Department of Environment (DoE) in Narayanganj stated that at least 344 industrial units dump liquid waste into the river, and among them, at least 287 have an effluent treatment plant (ETP). The report also said there are at least 2,000 factories close to the river’s banks. Md Sayeed Anwar, deputy director of DoE, Narayanganj, said all factories in Narayanganj were ordered to set up ETPs by June of 2010. “It is the department’s job to make sure that waste treatment plants are set up at every mill, and whether they are being properly used or not. I was appointed recently and it will take some time for me to get up to date on the matter,” he added. Liquid waste is dumped into the river on a regular basis from dyeing factories, paper mills, chemical industries, sugar mills, oil refineries and power plants. After a visit to the river, this reporter found that the water was completely polluted. Polythene bags, plastic bottles and various kinds of wastes were seen floating in several parts of the river. Chandra Shekhor, a local fisherman, said: “I have witnessed Shitalakshya dying before my eyes. During the rainy season, the river temporarily takes on its earlier form of glory, but the stench never faded.” Kartik Das, a fisherman in Shitalakshya for 45 years, said: ""My father and his father before him were all fishermen, but I can no longer sustain my family with fishing as fish has become a scarce commodity. ""Once, the river had such clean water, we used to bathe in it. We also used the water for drinking and cooking. Now, we cannot even go near it,"" added Kartik, shedding tears of nostalgia. Similar sentiments were echoed by fish trader Ratin, and boatmen Morshed Mia and Sharif Hazi. Morshed Mia said: ""There was once a time when fish used to swim freely when we rowed our boats. But now, all we see is garbage, with an unbearable bad smell in the air.” Illegally built structures are also endangering the river, as houses, auto-rickshaw stands, and sand warehouses were constructed along its banks. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) has conducted numerous drives to remove the illegal structures from the river’s banks. Md Gulzar Ali, BIWTA joint director and port officer of Narayanganj River Port, said: ""We conducted separate drives to demolish the illegal structures and will continue in the future."" AB Siddique, Narayanganj unit president of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (Bapa), said: ""We sat with DoE and BIWTA to discuss necessary steps to save the Shitalakshya. ""We have submitted a memorandum in this regard and will plan actions after Eid.

The curtain falls for Rashid Suhrawardy,The son of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy carried on his father’s legacy until his death,,2019-02-11,Dhaka Tribune,"A great man COURTESY The son of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy carried on his father’s legacy until his death Rashid Suhrawardy was his father’s son, in that very literal sense of the term. Anyone listening to him talk would, for a long phase, be momentarily deluded into thinking he was in the presence of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy himself. The resemblance was uncanny and absolute. There was the cosmopolitan about Rashid Suhrawardy, that urbanity which he had clearly inherited from his father. He adored his father and, at times, it seemed to me, that the elder Suhrawardy’s legacy was in truth being borne by his son. My earliest acquaintance with Rashid Suhrawardy was in my early years as an assistant editor at the daily New Nation in Dhaka, the introduction made by Barrister Mainul Hosein. We exchanged greetings before I sat down to hear him and the barrister exchanged thoughts on quite a few subjects. It was stimulating listening to the son of a former prime minister of Pakistan, a pivotal figure in pre-partition Bengal and then in post-1947 Pakistan. I was struck by not only Rashid Suhrawardy’s diction -- it was perfectly that of an Englishman -- but also by the self-assurance with which he carried himself. And, of course, at that first meeting, in his image, I was essentially looking at his father. There is something of a sudden crack in the heart knowing that Rashid Suhrawardy is dead. Here in London, in the deepening winter night, I am once more thrown into a bundle of riotous thoughts at the news that Suhrawardy saw his life coming to an end a few days ago in this city. Something of a willing suspension of disbelief comes in as I tell myself that, only a few days ago, he and I happened to be present on an occasion at Oxford University. No, we did not speak, for the crowd was too large for me to make my way to him to say hello. I planned to talk to him once the program was over. That was not to be, for Rashid Suhrawardy could not be found once everyone began to file out of the room. In that milling crowd, he must have made his way to his car and left for home. And yet, it is the memories of my association with Rashid Suhrawardy, however brief, which come alive this evening. Back in late 1998, he called me to say that the movie Jinnah, a story planned and put into concrete shape by Pakistani academic Akbar Ahmed, would be premiering at London’s West End. “I would like you to come and see it,” he said. He had a role in the movie. He was Nehru to Christopher Lee’s Jinnah. I was happy. He was waiting for me with a pass, happy that I had turned up. In the cast -- and he had been in theatre and cinema since the early 1960s -- he was Robert Ashby. That was his identity in the world of artistes he was comfortable in. He was beaming with happiness when the show drew to an end. We stood talking, when he suddenly realized that his cousin, Princess Sarvath al-Hassan of Jordan, was making for the exit after the show. He excused himself and rushed off to say goodbye to her. For readers who might not know, Princess Sarvath al-Hassan was the daughter of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy’s cousin, Begum Shaista Ikramullah, the pioneering Pakistani lawmaker and diplomat, and had married then Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan. Sarvath’s elder sister Salma, now deceased, was the spouse of Bangladesh’s reputed economist, scholar, and freedom fighter, Rehman Sobhan. In the last few years, despite my frequent visits to London, catching up with Rashid Suhrawardy was something that did not happen. But there was a point during our links in the past -- and I speak of a time around five years ago -- when he used to call me over the phone to speak of politics in Bangladesh. And, yes, he would often take issue with my write-ups on his father, especially over my assessments of HS Suhrawardy’s role in the Calcutta riots of 1946 and in post-1947 Pakistan. In a very proper British way, he would explain the realities, as he saw them, in the expectation that I would agree with him. I heard him out in politeness, before we both agreed, in so many words, to disagree. Our conversations were friendly, from beginning to end. But what did amaze me was that Rashid Suhrawardy found the time to call me -- and I certainly reciprocated the gesture -- and spend long nocturnal minutes on the phone exchanging thoughts with me. He was sad but not bitter that, while people in Bangladesh celebrated their struggle for freedom and revered their leaders, no one recalled his father when March 26 and December 16 came round. It was his view that Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy’s politics had paved the way for Bangladesh’s liberation. To flesh out the idea, he went into a long discourse on the Sarat-Suhrawardy proposal for an independent Bengal on the eve of Partition. It was hard to accept that argument, but there it was. He was doing all he could to defend his father’s legacy. From the perspective of a meeting, I met Rashid Suhrawardy a good many years ago at the residence of Professor Rehman Sobhan in Dhaka along with a friend. It was an afternoon spent listening to the many anecdotes he related about politics. Steeped in the western liberal tradition, Suhrawardy looked forward to a time when Bangladesh would graduate to democracy in the proper -- meaning globally recognized -- sense of the term. He was thrilled when the Awami League, so much a product of his father’s politics, returned to power in 1996 after having been in the wilderness for 21 years. Fond of Sheikh Hasina, he was convinced she would bring about a positive change in national politics. It excited him to no end knowing that his and Sheikh Hasina’s fathers had been instrumental in shaping the liberal politics that had aimed at democratizing Pakistan and eventually gave birth to Bangladesh. There were many among us, myself included, who looked forward to an official role for Rashid Suhrawardy in the Awami League scheme of things. In 1996, reports emerged, that Suhrawardy would be appointed Bangladesh’s high commissioner in the UK. Things did not turn out that way, of course. But if they had, we would be the winners. Rashid Suhrawardy would surely have enriched our diplomacy in the way we have always wanted. There was the past which was his glory. Where HS Suhrawardy’s daughter Begum Akhtar Suleiman went out on a limb to support the Yahya Khan regime in its brutality in 1971, Rashid Suhrawardy loudly upheld the Bangladesh cause in London. It was patriotism par excellence. Rashid Suhrawardy died all alone at his London home. Back in December 1963, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy died all alone in a hotel room in Beirut. The story ends. The curtain falls. The stage is empty. The hall goes silent. Rashid Suhrawardy has gone to meet his Maker.

Among them was Joep Lange, who researched the condition for more than 30 years and was considered a giant in the field, admired for his tireless advocacy for access to affordable AIDS drugs for HIV positive patients living in poor countries. ""Global health and the AIDS response have lost one of their great leaders,"" Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and a former executive director of UNAIDS, told Reuters in London.

What will happen if India-Pakistan lock into nuclear war?,"21m people will be directly killed, about half the world’s protective ozone layer would be destroyed, and a “nuclear winter” would cripple the monsoons and agriculture worldwide",,2016-09-29,Dhaka Tribune,"Pakistans nuclear arsenal India’s triad: Submarine, missile and aircraft If India and Pakistan fought a war detonating 100 nuclear warheads (around half of their combined arsenal), each equivalent to a 15-kiloton Hiroshima bomb, more than 21m people will be directly killed, about half the world’s protective ozone layer would be destroyed, and a “nuclear winter” would cripple the monsoons and agriculture worldwide. As the Indian Army reports striking terrorist camps across the border, and a member of Parliament (MP) of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) urges a nuclear attack and the Pakistan defence minister threatens to “annihilate” India in return, these projections, made by researchers from three US universities in 2007, are a reminder of the costs of nuclear war. On September 23, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy said if 100m Indians died in a Pakistani nuclear attack, India’s retaliation would wipe out Pakistan. [youtube id=""GIdfKzf_v_M""] But the real costs would be higher and not just in India and Pakistan, where the first 21m people–half the death toll of World War II–would perish within the first week from blast effects, burns and acute radiation. This death toll would be 2,221 times the number of civilians and security forces killed by terrorists in India over nine years to 2015, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of South Asia Terrorism Portal data. Another 2bn people worldwide would face risks of severe starvation due to the climatic effects of the nuclear-weapon use in the subcontinent, according to this 2013 assessment by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a global federation of physicians. Pakistan has an estimated 110 to 130 nuclear warheads as of 2015–an increase from an estimated 90 to 110 warheads in 2011–according to this report from the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. India is estimated to have 110 to 120 nuclear warheads. Talk of war began after a terrorist attack on an army garrison in the Kashmir town of Uri claimed the lives of 18 Indian soldiers. The Indian Army said the attack was carried out by four terrorists from the Jaish-e-Mohammed (Army of Mohammed) group, based in Pakistan. Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja M Asif responded to threats from India by saying, “If Pakistan’s security is threatened, we will not hesitate in using tactical (nuclear) weapons.” Pakistan’s nuclear weapons capability has previously deterred India from responding to previous attacks.As many as 66% Pakistani nuclear warheads are mounted on 86 land-based ballistic missiles, according to Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists data estimates. Pakistan’s Hatf (named after the sword of Prophet Muhammad) series of ballistic missiles has been developed–and is still under development–keeping India in mind. A major attack by Pakistan’s nuclear-tipped medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) would likely target India’s four major metropolitan cities–New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. The MRBMs would also target the major commands of the Indian Army. Nearly half (40) of Pakistan’s ballistic missile warheads could be mated to Ghauri (named after 12th-century Afghan king Shahbuddin Ghauri, also known as Muhammad of Ghauri) MRBMs. The missile has a claimed range of 1,300km and can target Delhi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Bhopal and Lucknow, according to this 2006 report on Pakistan’s ballistic missile programme by the National Institute of Advanced Studies (Nias), Bengaluru. [caption id=""attachment_18881"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1024""]The Shaheen-III missile is displayed during the Pakistan Day parade in Islamabad, Pakistan, March 23, 2016.[/caption] Pakistan has an estimated eight warheads which could be mated to the Shaheen (Falcon) II. This MRBM has a range of 2,500km and can target most major Indian cities, including Kolkata on the east coast. An estimated 16 warheads could be fired atop the short-range Ghaznavi (named after the 11th-century Afghan invader Mahmud Ghazni) ballistic missile. With a range of 270km to 350km, it can target Ludhiana, Ahmedabad and the outer perimeter of Delhi. Pakistan has an estimated 16 nuclear-tipped Shaheen1 (falcon), short-range ballistic missiles (IRBM), having a 750km range which can reach Ludhiana, Delhi, Jaipur and Ahmedabad. Pakistan has an estimated six 60-km range Nasr missiles, which could be mated to nuclear weapons. These tactical nuclear missiles could target advancing battle formations of the Indian Army. Pakistan also has 8 nuclear-tipped 350km Babur cruise missiles with nuclear warheads. An estimated 36 nuclear warheads, accounting for 28% of Pakistan’s total, can be delivered using aircraft. US-made F-16 A/B aircraft can deliver 24 nuclear bombs while the French-made Mirage III/V can deliver 12.India has deployed 56 Prithvi (earth) and Agni (fire) series of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, which carry 53% of India’s 106 estimated warheads, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. This doesn’t take into account the estimated 12 warheads for the K-15 Sagarika submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), which India has possibly produced for the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine INS Arihant. Given the smaller geographical size of Pakistan, India would likely target Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi and the Pakistani Army Armed Corps headquarters at Nowshera.

These are capable of hitting major Pakistani cities, such as Lahore, Sialkot, the capital Islamabad, and Rawalpindi, according to this May 2015 IndiaSpend analysis. India has 20 nuclear-tipped Agni I SRBM and eight Agni II intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), with ranges of 700km and 2,000km, respectively. These are capable of covering almost all Pakistani cities, including Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Multan, Peshawar, Karachi, Quetta and Gwadar. Agni III, IV and V, with their longer ranges, might be able to reach all of Pakistan, but it can be safely said that they are directed more towards China. India also possesses an estimated two ship-launched 350km range Dhanush SRBM, which could be fitted with nuclear warheads. India’s aircraft can deliver an estimated 45% of 106 warheads.

Oral sex spreading unstoppable bacteria,"'Every time you introduce a new class of antibiotic to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant,' said Dr Teodora Wi from WHO",,2017-10-01,Dhaka Tribune,"What is gonorrhoea? According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a new strain of untreatable bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as “super” gonorrhoea, is likely to spread through oral sex, reports the Independent. Oral sex and a decline in the use of condoms are reportedly behind the spread. The sexually transmitted infection (STI) is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics, therefore making the situation quite grave. According to the BBC, about 78 million people pick up the STI each year. In a study from 2009 to 2014, the WHO analysed data from 77 countries which showed gonorrhoea’s resistance to antibiotics becoming widespread. The bacteria became resistant to the first-line medicine ciprofloxacin, further increasing resistance to another antibiotic drug called azithromycin, and resistance to last resort treatments known as extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). Dr Teodora Wi from the WHO said there had been three cases – in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable, reports the Forbes. She said: “Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug. Every time you introduce a new class of antibiotic to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant.” One of the reasons this antibiotic-resistant bacteria is spreading is due to unprotected oral sex, where it can transmit Neisseria gonorrhoeae from a person’s privates to one’s throat and vice versa. Once transmitted via oral sex, the infection shows no symptoms on its own, but mimics other typical symptoms of throat infections such as strep throat or sore throat. Therefore, Dr Wi said that treating the infections like a normal sore throat mixes with the Neisseria species in the throat, resulting in resistance. The WHO is calling on countries to monitor the spread of resistant gonorrhoea and to invest in new drugs. Ultimately, the WHO said vaccines would be needed to stop gonorrhoea, reports the BBC.It is a sexually transmitted infection, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Untreated gonorrhoea can further lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, also increasing the risk of getting HIV.",{},"['throat', 'resistance', 'resistant', 'spreading', 'transmitted', 'gonorrhoea', 'spread', 'infection', 'unstoppable', 'bacteria', 'sex', 'neisseria', 'oral']","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a new strain of untreatable bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as “super” gonorrhoea, is likely to spread through oral sex, reports the Independent.

First day of ICAAP 12 marked by mismanagement,"Day one of the International Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, (ICAAP) 12, organised for the first time in Bangladesh, was marked by mismanagement",,2016-03-12,Dhaka Tribune,"Day one of the International Conference on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific, (ICAAP) 12, organised for the first time in Bangladesh, was marked by mismanagement. The largest international AIDS forum was inaugurated in the afternoon by President Md Abdul Hamid. The registered foreign delegates attending the conference however complained about mismanagement on the very first day. Among the delegates, Khartini Slamah, the TG Programme Officer of Global Fund ISEAN Hivos Programme, PT Foundation, said to Dhaka Tribune: “Everyone is lost when they are searching a way to what is going on around here.” “I think the one who is the in-charge of organising this programme is not clear about organising an international conference here in Bangladesh,” Khartini also added. Many foreign delegates complained to Dhaka Tribune that they had not received their registration card and bag, which includes the session description and directions. Some did not even get lunch after paying the registration and other fees, observed this reporter. Khartini also expected to see the participation of young people, such as students, as the conference was about AIDS awareness. “The committee should have a look at these problems, like briefing the volunteers who are here to help direct the delegation,” she added. The people who paid to be delegation members became frustrated over these issues, which must be addressed, said many delegates. Another delegate from the UK, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I have attended so many conferences around the world. But this is the first time I became so confused after seeing the mismanagement.” Khartini marked the management of the conference as 3.5 out of 10. Another delegate, IOM official Samir Kumar Howlader, while attending a session, complained about the mismanagement as two to three sessions were running in a single room at International Convention City Bashundhara. Participants of each session were facing problems participating due to the chaotic environment. While addressing the complaints and problems faced by the delegates, ICAAP12 Co-Chair Prof Dr AKM Nurun Nabi acknowledged the mismanagement. He said: “This type of large event is taking place for the first time in Bangladesh. So, on the first day of the event, there is bound to be a disaster, which we also faced when we attended conferences in other countries.” But he acknowledged the disaster by pointing out the lack of Bangladeshi event management companies with experience organising this type of international conference. He also said he hopes to sort out the problems from the next day. When this reporter tried to contact the joint organiser, Partners in Population and Development (PPD), no one responded to the reporter’s query. In the afternoon, President Hamid in his speech marked the discrimination faced by AIDS patients as “saddening.” He said: “AIDS is not a curse. But AIDS patients suffer negligence, which they do not deserve.” He urged people to change their perception about AIDS and called everyone to be broad-minded. The president also said: “We have to give more attention to find the HIV patients who are living in disguise, because their cases seem to become a serious threat to spreading HIV among the public. “It is time for an end to discrimination and stigmatisation of people living with HIV/AIDS. The plight of the AIDS widows, AIDS orphans or for that matter the children and spouses of those living with AIDS is very challenging. This year, about 1,000 representatives from 56 countries are participating in the International Congress, jointly organised by the Health and Family Welfare ministry and Partners in Population and Development (PPD).

"June 1966, Six Points, and the making of history",The historical significance of June 7,,2018-06-07,Dhaka Tribune,"Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s announcement of the Six Points changed historyNASHIRUL ISLAM The historical significance of June 7 June 7 remains a seminal moment in national history, a definitive point of reference in Bangladesh’s political narrative. On this day in 1966, the people of what was then East Pakistan enforced a total general strike in the province in support of the Awami League’s Six Point program of autonomy. The Six Points had been announced a few months earlier by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, yet to be Bangabandhu, in Lahore, where he had gone to attend a conference of Pakistan’s opposition political figures. The strike, in the course of which a number of individuals died from police firing and a number of others were injured, was a clear instance of the Bengalis making their displeasure about their place in Pakistan known to the authorities. For the first time in the 19-year history of Pakistan, stirrings of revolt, loud and insistent, were felt all over Pakistan. But even as the general strike, or hartal, kept the province in its grip throughout the day, the central leaders of the AL -- Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Tajuddin Ahmad, and others -- stayed behind bars. The strike would be spearheaded by two young AL politicians, Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury and Amena Begum. Mujib, who would not become Bangabandhu till three years later, had been placed in detention under the Defense of Pakistan Rules on May 8, 1966. The reason was not hard to understand: Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan, who had seized power in a coup in October 1958 and declared himself president of Pakistan, had made clear his view of the Six Points. He told the country that the purveyors of the Six Points would be dealt with in the language of weapons. He had found the enemy. In time, it would be Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who would turn out to be the most vocal and therefore the most dangerous enemy of the Ayub regime. Ayub Khan was not the only individual who spotted a threat to Pakistan’s unity should the Six Points be acknowledged. His soon-to-be-out foreign minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, challenged Mujib early in the year to a public debate at Dhaka’s Paltan Maidan on the Six Points. It was Tajuddin Ahmad who accepted the challenge on Mujib’s behalf. In the event, Bhutto did not turn up. The Six Point program included the following. 1. Pakistan would have a federal structure of government based on the spirit of the Lahore Resolution of 1940, with a parliament elected on the basis of universal adult franchise. 2. The central government would have authority only in defense and foreign affairs and all other subjects would be handled by the federating units of the state of Pakistan. 3. There would be two freely convertible currencies for the two wings of Pakistan or two separate reserve banks for the two regions of the country. 4. The power of taxation and revenue collection would be vested in the federating units. 5. There would be two separate accounts for foreign exchange reserves for the two wings of Pakistan. 6. East Pakistan would have a separate militia or paramilitary force as a measure towards ensuring its security. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman planned to announce the Six Points at a conference of opposition political parties in Lahore in early February 1966. He was not permitted to do so by the other participants, including the chief of the All-Pakistan Awami League at the time, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan. They found the plan too incendiary to be articulated. Rebuffed, Mujib announced the plan at a news conference in Lahore the following day, February 5, 1966. Mujib’s move raised howls of protest all over Pakistan. The civil-military bureaucracy and politicians straddling both government and opposition circles were quick to dub the Six Points as a secessionist plot to dismember Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s arrest in May 1966, followed by the June 7 strike, swiftly led to circumstances where the Pakistan government opted for all-encompassing repression in East Pakistan. Tofazzal Hossain Manik Mia, the respected editor of the Bengali daily Ittefaq, was arrested on June 16 over his support for the Six Points. The next day, a ban was clamped on his newspaper. Events would move fast after June 1966. In January 1968, Mujib would be charged with conspiracy to break up Pakistan. The case, which would become notorious as the Agartala Conspiracy Case, would eventually be withdrawn under public pressure on February 22, 1969. A day after his release, Mujib would be publicly acclaimed as Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal) at a historic million-strong rally in Dhaka.

Addressing BNP leaders and activists, he said the partys previous decision not to join parliament has been changed with a goal in mind. “We cannot lose hope until we have achieved our goals,” he added. “During the anti-Ershad movement, the coalition BNP made—joining with Awami League and other parties—was a necessity for the time. Despite being a supporter of the presidential form of government, Begum Khaleda Zia agreed to Awami League’s parliamentary form of government only to ensure the fall of the Ershad-led government,” he said. A photo exhibition on Khaleda Zia’s long political life, achievements, and sacrifices has been installed as a part of the event. BNP Joint Secretary General Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal said: “We need to strengthen our communication with our alliance partners right now, because we all are facing the same crisis. We have only one way left… ‘work together to make it together’. The panel’s special guest and former Dhaka University Vice-chancellor Prof Emajuddin Ahmed said: “BNP shouldnt take decision alone. They have to hold discussions with alliance partners and party leaders.” “The delay in BNP’s decision to go to the parliament led to criticism from the 20-party alliance and other parties. But this decision is a new way for the movement to progress, I think,” he said. NRC Director Babul Talukder arranged the photo exhibition, with over 100 photos of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her political sacrifices.",{},"['bnp', 'media', 'secretary', 'confusion', 'political', 'zia', 'fakhrul', 'khaleda', 'decision', 'sow', 'general', 'sacrifices', 'used', 'social', 'national', 'parliament']","Addressing BNP leaders and activists, he said the party's previous decision not to join parliament has been changed with a goal in mind.

She made the comment on Sunday, while speaking at a human chain organized in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka, by Jatiyo Mukti Council. Members from different human rights groups gathered there, demanding answers about United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF) leader Michael’s whereabouts. “When a country’s [security] forces are involved in disappearance, murder, and abduction, then the government’s legitimacy itself becomes questionable,” Rahnuma said. Michael’s family alleged that he went missing from Narayanganj on April 9 and is still traceless. Rahnuma further said: “When law enforcement agencies stonewall an investigation, it raises doubts. They are not helping, which in itself is a crime."" She claimed that abduction and enforced disappearances has now become an ""epidemic"" in the country. Following Michaels disappearance, a case was filed with Narayanganj police station, but the investigation led to nowhere. Speaking at the human chain, Fazlul Hakim, secretary of Jatiyo Mukti Council, said: “He [Michael] fought for the rights of hill people, the indigenous tribes and against fundamentalism. It is unacceptable that he cant be found anywhere.” Fazlul called for rooting out “enforced disappearance” from our political culture and urged that Michael be quickly returned to his family. Poet Hasan Fakri sought Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas intervention in the matter. UPDF leader Michael Chakma is also the general secretary of United Workers’ Democratic Front (UWDF).

Solidarity works!,"How volunteers contribute to common goods
        	In Bangladesh, volunteering and mutual help are core values of society: around 16 million people annually decide to get involved in their community and volunteer",,2013-12-09,Dhaka Tribune,"In Bangladesh, volunteering and mutual help are core values of society: around 16 million people annually decide to get involved in their community and volunteer. Interestingly, volunteerism in Bangladesh is neither restricted to a specific sector nor to any age group. Old and young, men and women, they all dedicate their time to change society from within, playing an important role in transforming society. Volunteerism permeates every aspect of society. Many volunteers strengthen education and health services in the public sector. Others volunteer in non-governmental organizations and contribute to the vibrant civil society of Bangladesh. Particularly when it comes to disaster response, the Bangladeshi volunteer spirit has come out and amazed the world. Millions of people are engaged in organizations such as the Bangladesh Scouts, Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP) or the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and play an essential role in early warning and disaster response. During acute disasters, these volunteer-based organizations bridge the gap between the national government and local communities, through volunteers who travel to every village and inform the population about the magnitude and impact of cyclones. Volunteers assist in disaster response and have in the past evacuated people in need. Due to the efforts of these dedicated people, who are willing to risk their lives for others, the number of deaths caused by natural disasters has reduced significantly. Their contribution to reducing the disaster vulnerability has been highlighted in the Disaster Management Act (DM Act 2012). The act emphasizes the role of community self-help organizations and local networks as the most effective resources for reducing risk vulnerability in communities and building adaptive capacity. As such, the DM Act 2012 proposes the establishment of a National Volunteer Corps to integrate volunteers into disaster management. People’s motivation to be engaged in their community is also seen on a much smaller scale, for example, in schools and universities, where young people come together to form social clubs. These clubs aim to improve the life of disenfranchised groups in Bangladeshi society. They work towards promoting a more environmental friendly society or address other issues close to their heart. In recent years, Bangladeshis have repeatedly proven that they are willing to volunteer for their community, regardless of financial incentives and other forms of recognition. The spontaneous urge to help each other became obvious following the complete collapse of the Rana Plaza building in April, when hundreds of people flocked to Savar to assist in rescue efforts. Rickshaw-pullers, street vendors, university students and day laborers joined hands and worked tirelessly alongside the rescue operations teams of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, saving 2,500 people from the rubble. Many different volunteer-based organizations offer people the opportunity to become active citizens and contribute to the development of their country. The great contributions of volunteers towards development are annually celebrated on the 5th of December, International Volunteer Day. People around the world take time to pause and reflect on the tremendous contribution of civil society towards a more just world and volunteerism is specifically acknowledged as an important catalyst for social transformation. The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme is the United Nations (UN) organization that contributes to peace and development through volunteerism worldwide. Since 1975, when the first international UN Volunteer started his assignment in Bangladesh, hundreds of UN Volunteers have supported different UN Agencies, government offices and civil society organizations. Every year passionate Bangladeshi volunteer abroad through UNV: they strengthen development programmes in countries like Sudan, Pakistan, Jamaica and Cote d’Ivoire. On International Volunteer Day, we look at the achievements and celebrate volunteerism worldwide. This year, UNV wants to highlight the contributions of volunteers towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Bangladesh. The eight MDGs, which range from halving extreme poverty to providing universal primary education, form a blueprint agreed by all world’s countries. Bangladesh is one of the top performing least developed countries and has achieved great successes, especially in the provision of education and the reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality. When talking about the MDGs and the many positive changes that occurred in the last decade in Bangladesh, we should not forget that it is people who change their world. To achieve these fundamental, but ambitious, development goals it requires much more than the involvement of governments and the international community. Of course policies play an important role, but in the end it is the knowledge, solidarity and creativity of millions of people that ensure the sustainability of our achievements. Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger Sajal Roy Since its establishment, Jege Otho Foundation fully relies on committed volunteers to plan and implement projects several days a week in schools, public spaces and the Jege Otho training center in Jessore. Sajal is the coordinator of PATSHALA, a game school where children and youths can come together to develop life skills in an informal setting. Many underprivileged kids from poor backgrounds come together and play football, cricket as well as discussing personal issues with the volunteers of Jege Otho. Sajal believes that through exercise and the experience of a safe space, they will develop mentally as well as physically. “Even though we do not directly reduce poverty by for example distributing food items, I think our work contributes in many ways to society” Sajal says. Achieve Universal Primary Education Daina Chakma As a national UN Volunteer, Daina Chakma has been supporting the Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Facility of UNDP. As an Educational Assistant she worked with communities to strengthen community education project: many people joined the project and volunteered in the renovation and constructions of schools by providing local materials and free labor. Through the construction of these schools, access to education was improved in many remote communities and children do not have to walk long distances to go to school. Daina believes that education is key for people’s development and really enjoyed her volunteer service. Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women Rowshon Akhter Urmee Violence against women is a critical issue in Bangladesh. The youth-led Brave Men campaign aims at raising awareness on the issue by addressing concepts of masculinity. Urmee believes that gender stereotypes effect everyone and many boys are socialized in a context where violence against women – either verbal or physical – is accepted by society. Together with some friends she started to hold workshops on gender in boy’s schools. Their aim is to deconstruct the concept of bravery – which is often closely connected to violence against women – of teenage boys. The completely volunteer-based movement runs 2-month workshops in different schools and is happy to contribute to gender equality. Reduce Child Mortality Minjoon Kim Minjoon Kim decided to serve as an international UN Volunteer in 2012 and moved from Seoul to Dhaka. Minjoon is supporting UNICEF as an international UN Volunteer, is part of a team that gives trainings and support to hospitals and community workers on newborn care practices in Tangail district. When he arrived in Bangladesh, he was nervous: “Did I have the necessary skills? Would my experience as surgeon be enough?” were the questions he asked himself. After several field trips and discussions with colleagues, he grew confident. Now, he supports local NGOs in the monitoring process and conducts trainings with community help workers and implementing partners. He is part of a project that contributed to the globally acknowledged success in reducing under-5 mortality rate. Improve Maternal Health Halima, Jesmin and Farida During their nursing training, Halima, Jesmin and Farida witnessed the dangers of childbirth for women as well as newborns first hand. Since then, these three dedicated women have dedicated a lot of time and energy to improving maternal health and are part of the first group of certified midwives in Bangladesh. They met during a training course for midwifery and decided to create the Bangladesh Midwifery Society (BMS), an organization that advocates for their profession and offers trainings for nurses to become midwives. Next to their regular job as midwives and nurses, they are midwifery trainers and are board members of the BMS. The BMS offers a support structure for newly certified midwives and plays an important role in consolidating this new profession within the medical system in Bangladesh. Combat HIV/Aids, Malaria and other Diseases Sharif Kaukab Since the early 1990s, Sharif Kaukab has been serving as an international UN Volunteer in many different countries, such as Liberia, Nigeria and now Bangladesh. As the UN physician, he supports staff members and their families and plays an important role in the well-being of many people. As an experienced doctor, he has seen the devastating effects of global public health issues such as HIV/Aids and malaria. These two illnesses cause many deaths worldwide and Sharif believes that one reason for this is lack of knowledge. Thus, it is important to spread information on these issues, for example through community talks. He believes that “an open and pro-active approach is essential to stop the spread of HIV: access to treatment and a non-discriminatory way of engaging with HIV-infected people build an important basis for preventative methods to be fruitful.” Ensure Environmental Sustainability Sharmin Bulbul Lita The Noazesh Knowledge Center (NKC) was founded in 2011 by the NGO WildTeam, which focuses on the protection of the Bengal Tiger and nature conservation. The NKC provides information on conservation and environmental issues to the public. 450 young members from different socio-economic backgrounds use the library or go on study trips to learn about environmental challenges in Bangladesh. Volunteers play a crucial role in the activities of the NKC: The center, which has only two paid staff members, relies on volunteers for activities such as data-collection, data entry, and support in organizing events, such as the Rikshaw challenge in February 2013, where 20 activists cycled from Teknaf to Chandpai to spread the message of tiger protection and environmental conservation. The latter is directly linked to reducing the effects of climate change and thus contributes to reducing the threats of natural disasters. A Global Partnership for Development Mohammad Mamun Mia When I enrolled in university, I started to volunteer at the United Nations Youth and Student Association of Bangladesh (UNYSAB), which was a game-changer for me. After volunteering in the organization for some years, I am now working as the President of UNYSAB. By joining UNYSAB or participating in the activities, students get the chance to work on a variety of social and global issues, such as the spread of HIV or the development of a global partnership. We introduce the United Nations to youth and encourage young people to inform themselves and participate in a global network created by different UN student groups all over the world. We promote volunteering because we see volunteerism as a means to develop leadership skills. Giving back to the community and advocating for the rights of groups at the margins of society are essential characteristics of good leadership. What will happen after 2015? The MDGs, which have formed and defined the global development discourse in the past years, have played an important role in focusing on core development issues. While we are getting closer to our deadline, people all over the world are discussing the next development framework. The United Nations has taken up the challenge to ensure that the next development framework comes out of a transparent and open global debate, in which civil society organizations can share their vision for post-2015. Together with three youth-led organizations, namely JAAGO, Youth Power in Social Action (YPSA) and Jege Otho Foundation, UNV has organized and facilitated three youth consultations in Jessore, Chittagong and Dhaka, allowing youths to share their thoughts on the next development framework. Over 80 young people representing 30 organizations came together and discussed issues close to their heart, like the lack of equality in access to information, education, employment, health facilities and basic rights. Their visionary thinking clearly showed that they are not only looking at their community, their region or their country, but rather aspire to a movement for global equality. The results of the youth consultations will be published in January 2014 and are supplemental to the already published Report on the Post-2015 Development Agenda for Bangladesh. The stories below show what change can occur because of an individual’s decision. They only exemplify the many ways in which volunteers contribute to positive and sustainable change in Bangladesh and many more stories could be told. We hope that the stories remind everyone that it is the small changes that really make a difference and change people’s lives.",{},"['community', 'issues', 'volunteer', 'volunteers', 'bangladesh', 'organizations', 'society', 'development', 'solidarity', 'role', 'important', 'works']","Old and young, men and women, they all dedicate their time to change society from within, playing an important role in transforming society.

"Drug company defends 5,000% price rise","The head of a US pharmaceutical company has defended his company's decision to raise the price of a 62-year-old medication used by Aids patients by over 5,000%",,2015-09-22,Dhaka Tribune,"The head of a US pharmaceutical company has defended his companys decision to raise the price of a 62-year-old medication used by Aids patients by over 5,000%. Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired the rights to Daraprim in August. CEO Martin Shkreli has said that the company will use the money it makes from sales to research new treatments. The drug is used treat toxoplasmosis, a parasitic affliction that affects people with compromised immune systems. After Turnings acquisition, a dose of Daraprim in the US increased from $13.50 (£8.70) to $750. The pill costs about $1 to produce, but Mr Shkreli, a former hedge fund manager, said that does not include other costs like marketing and distribution. ""We needed to turn a profit on this drug,"" Mr Shkreli told Bloomberg TV. ""The companies before us were just giving it away almost."" On Twitter, Mr Shkreli mocked several users who questioned the companys decision, calling one reporter ""a moron"".

Dr Wendy Armstrong of HIV Medicine Association also disputed the need to develop new treatments for toxoplasmosis. ""This is not an infection where we have been looking for more effective drugs,"" she told Infectious Disease News.

The 17-piece ensemble includes the villain’s black mask, boots, a pair of capes and a codpiece, said the auctioneers, who estimated it could sell for between $1 million and $2 million. The seller is Bryce “Kermit” Eller, whose deep voice helped him land a job making public appearances as Vader at premieres, book signings, conventions and the 1978 Academy Awards. The costume going up for auction is one of a handful of Vader outfits produced in 1979 by the team of “Star Wars” costume designer John Mollo in London for the movie “The Empire Strikes Back,” Bonhams said. It is unclear if any pieces were used on screen before they were given to Eller. The components are made from leather, wool, silk, fiberglass and other materials, Eller said in an interview. “It’s really, really hot,” Eller said. “You’ve got multiple layers. It takes about 25 minutes to put it on, and you’ve got to have assistance.” In fact, Eller said he once fainted after wearing the costume for hours and becoming dehydrated. Paramedics came to his assistance and wanted to cut it off. “I said ‘absolutely not,’” Eller said. “I said ‘I’ll heal. The costume won’t.’” The outfit will be part of a public exhibition with Turner Classic Movies starting on May 4 before going on sale on May 14.

Harvard professor loses house dean role after joining Weinstein defense,"In January, a judge approved Weinstein’s request to have Sullivan join his legal team",,2019-05-13,Dhaka Tribune,"Film producer Harvey Weinsteins lawyer Ronald Sullivan Jr at New York Supreme court in the Manhattan borough of New York City on January 25 REUTERS In January, a judge approved Weinstein’s request to have Sullivan join his legal team A Harvard law professor who joined the legal team defending Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein against sexual assault charges will not be allowed to continue as dean of a residential house on campus, a university official said on Saturday. The Ivy League university’s move to end the role of law professor Ronald Sullivan Jr and law school lecturer Stephanie Robinson, Sullivan’s wife, at Winthrop House follows protests over his representation of Weinstein. Sullivan and Robinson in 2009 became the first African-American faculty deans in Harvard history when they took their positions at Winthrop House, one of several undergraduate residences at the Cambridge, Massachusetts, university. Their terms as faculty deans were scheduled to end on June 30. Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana said in a statement that he had decided not to keep them in their roles at Winthrop House beyond that date. “Over the last few weeks, students and staff have continued to communicate concerns about the climate in Winthrop House to the college,” Khurana said. “The concerns expressed have been serious and numerous. The actions that have been taken to improve the climate have been ineffective, and the noticeable lack of faculty dean presence during critical moments has further deteriorated the climate in the house,” Khurana said. Khurana has previously said Sullivan’s decision to join Weinstein’s legal team was a matter of academic freedom and that everyone is entitled to a vigorous legal defense. Sullivan and Robinson continue to hold their positions at Harvard Law School. Sullivan and Robinson said in a joint statement that they were “surprised and dismayed” by the decision. “We believed the discussions we were having with high level university representatives were progressing in a positive manner, but Harvard unilaterally ended those talks,” they said. In January, a judge approved Weinstein’s request to have Sullivan join his legal team. Prosecutors in New York accuse Weinstein, 67, of forcibly performing oral sex on a woman in 2006 and raping another woman in 2013. Weinstein faces five criminal charges, including rape, and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. More than 70 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. He has denied all accusations and said any contact was consensual. Students at Winthrop House staged a sit-in this month to protest Sullivan’s defense of Weinstein, according to a report at the time in the Harvard Crimson student newspaper. Students denounced Sullivan in other actions earlier this year.",{},"['york', 'house', 'harvard', 'defense', 'legal', 'loses', 'winthrop', 'weinstein', 'professor', 'dean', 'sullivan', 'weinsteins', 'law', 'robinson', 'role', 'joining']","The Ivy League university’s move to end the role of law professor Ronald Sullivan Jr and law school lecturer Stephanie Robinson, Sullivan’s wife, at Winthrop House follows protests over his representation of Weinstein.

ADB to sign $50m loan deal with PKSF on Wednesday,The agreement will be signed at 10am at the NEC Conference Room in Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area,,2019-02-04,Dhaka Tribune,"The agreement will be signed at 10am at the NEC Conference Room in Dhakas Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide $50 million loan to promote microenterprise development in Bangladesh through a credit line to Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) and its partner microfinance institutions. “In this regard, the loan agreement between the government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be signed on Wednesday at 10am at the NEC Conference Room in Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area,” said an Economic Relations Division (ERD) official. The official told BSS that ERD Secretary Monowar Ahmed and ADB Country Director Manmohan Parkash will sign the agreement on behalf of their respective sides. Besides, another project agreement will also be signed by the ADB and PKSF, a development finance organization. According to the ERD and the ADB, the project will help PKSF to develop a financing strategy and carry out institutional strengthening. For the longer term, the project will develop microenterprise finance operational guidelines for microfinance institutions, including piloting for some partner organizations, through a mobile-based financing application. It will also assist in clustering microenterprises for business expansion and up-scaling with quality control, branding, packaging and marketing. Out of the total project cost of $62.5 million, which is due for completion at the end of 2020, the microenterprises will contribute $12.5 million. The project is accompanied by an ADB technical assistance grant of $500,000 to enhance the capacity of PKSF and its partner organizations in microenterprise lending and promoting sustainable operations. The grant is from ADB’s Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund, financed in partnership with the Government of Luxembourg. ADB Senior Portfolio Management Specialist Mayumi Ozaki, during approval of the ADB fund, earlier had said that boosting financing through microfinance institutions to microenterprises will promote rural growth and income and job opportunities. At present, Bangladesh’s microfinance industry comprises 758 microfinance institutions servicing 30 million clients. Microfinance traditionally provides savings and credit to finance cottage-size enterprises in rural areas run by poor or low-income people who have no access to formal financial services. The government set up PKSF in 1990 as an apex development finance and capacity building organization that provides loans to partner organizations. It has become an important funding source for small and medium-sized microfinance institutions. But, at current funding levels, PKSF and its partner organizations can meet only part of their existing members’ demand. The ADB project will help fill the funding gap in the short term. The loan will be provided to PKSF to on-lend to partner organizations and sub-lend to about 40,000 microenterprises, of which 70% are run by female entrepreneurs.",{},"['partner', 'sign', 'microfinance', 'institutions', 'finance', 'adb', '50m', 'organizations', 'microenterprises', 'project', 'development', 'loan', 'pksf', 'deal']","Besides, another project agreement will also be signed by the ADB and PKSF, a development finance organization.

"IGP: Militants targeting law enforcement officials, increasing ‘lone wolf’ attacks",'It will be possible to resist the tendency of ‘lone wolf’ attacks if people provide information about militants or suspicious activities',,2019-05-16,Dhaka Tribune,"File photo of Inspector General of Police Dr Mohammad Javed Patwary It will be possible to resist the tendency of ‘lone wolf’ attacks if people provide information about militants or suspicious activities Inspector General of police (IGP) Mohammad Javed Patwary has said militants are targeting law enforcement officials, including police, with an increasing trend of “lone wolf” attacks. “Militants are now using the lone wolf system all over the world. The trend of lone wolf attacks has gone up compared to that of coordinated attacks, and it is almost impossible to stop this trend,” he said. The IGP made the statements during an event of the Executive Committee of the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) at the police headquarters on Wednesday At the event, IGP Javed Patwary said: “Militant activities are under control, but it is not possible to completely eradicate militancy without raising awareness. Awareness was raised among the people after the Holey Artisan Bakery attack. “It will be possible to resist the tendency of ‘lone wolf’ attacks if people provide information about militants or suspicious activities,” he added. The IGP also claimed that no foreign militant organizations are active in Bangladesh. “Militant organizations like Islamic State (IS) are not active in Bangladesh, but they may have communicated their ideology to some of the people.” Regarding the so-called leader of IS’s Bangladesh branch Abu Muhammad al-Bangali, the IGP said: ""News about Al-Bangali surfaced in the media. We have heard from the media about his threats."" In response to a question, IGP Javed Patwary said there were no specific threats regarding the upcoming Buddha Purnima, but security measures had been tightened as a precaution, especially in Buddhist majority areas. “Processions for Buddha Purnima will be brought out in Dhaka and areas of the hill tracts. The processions will be provided with special security. We have held meetings with leaders of the Buddhist community, and their security needs will be met,” he said.

Parliament declares March 25 Genocide Day,Lawmakers also called for greater government initiative to ensure March 25 was recognised internationally,,2017-03-11,Dhaka Tribune,"The Black Night Parliament on Saturday unanimously adopted a resolution declaring March 25 as Genocide Day during the 14th session, in remembrance of the brutality carried out by the Pakistani Army in the ""Black Night"" of March 25, 1971. Earlier in the day, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dals General Secretary and MP Shirin Akhter placed the proposal first, after Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury asked for proposals, under section 147 of the Houses rules of procedure at the outset of the session. Later on, Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed placed the same proposal again, but in an amended form. Besides, he, also an Awami League lawmaker, suggested that the government take initiative so that December 9, which is marked as the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide, as declared by the United nations, sees the March 25 victims being commemorated internationally as well. He also called for observing December 1 as Freedom Fighters Day and the governments more active role to draw international attention in this regard. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, after the proposals were tabled, showed videos and pictures on genocide using projectors at the parliament. Different organisations including Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, Antorjatik Juddaporadh o Gonobichar Andolan, and the AL-led 14-party alliance had long been demanding the recognition of March 25 as Genocide Day.The attack termed ""Operation Searchlight"" by the military was launched after Awami League supremo Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared independence of Bangladesh in a message. He was subsequently arrested, flown to Pakistan and kept in jail. The exact number of casualty could not be known. But foreign journalists working in Dhaka at that time estimated the number to be between 7,000 and 35,000. The purpose of the operation was to arrest or kill the distinguished Awami League leaders, student leaders and Bangali intellectuals in the main cities of the then East Pakistan including Dhaka, to disarm the Bangali members of military, para military and police forces and to capture armoury, radio station and telephone exchange. From the report of Simon Dring published under the caption Dateline Dacca in the Daily Telegraph of March 29, it was revealed that 200 students of Iqbal Hall (now Shaheed Sergeant Zahurul Haq Hall), teachers and their family members numbering 12 in Dhaka University residential area had been killed on that night. In Old Dhaka, around 700 people were burnt to death. The Pakistani military rulers thereby wanted to take over the control of East Pakistan by ruthlessly curbing the non-cooperation movement headed by Bangabandhu. Military operations were carried out under ""Operation Searchlight"" from 11:30pm of March 25 to the middle of May in all the big towns of erstwhile East Pakistan, according to Banglapedia . The ""Operation Searchlight"" was scheduled to be launched at 1pm on March 26, but Mujibs message prompted then president Yahya Khan to launch the crackdown immediately.

Nusrat murder: 3 sent back to jail after one-day remand,They have confessed to their involvement in Nusrat's murder,,2019-05-09,Dhaka Tribune,"Police escort Jobayer Ahmed, a key accused in the Nusrat Jahan Rafi murder case, at the Feni court premises on Sunday, April 21, 2019 Dhaka Tribune They have confessed to their involvement in Nusrats murder A Feni court has sent three accused in the case filed for the murder of madrasa student Nusrat Jahan Rafi, back to jail – after their one-day remand. Feni Senior Judicial Magistrate, Md Jakir Hossain, passed the order on Thursday as police produced them before the court after their remand. The accused are Shahadat Hossain Shamim, Javed Hossain, and Jobayer Ahmed. Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune, Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) Inspector Md Shah Alam said: ""The three accused have already confessed in court to their direct involvement in the attack on Nusrat. ""We produced them before the court seeking a three-day remand for more extensive interrogation and also to collect more evidence related with Nusrats murder. The court granted only a one-day remand."" ""We were able to extract information regarding the glass that was used to pour kerosene on Nusrat. ""We recovered the glass from the second floor of the Sonagazi Islamia Senior Fazil Madrasas academic building."" Previously, on Wednesday, police produced these three accused before the court seeking a three-day remand – though the court granted only one-day remand. Alim examinee Nusrat suffered 80% burns after she was set on fire on the roof of the institution in Sonagazi on April 6; by four burqa-clad assailants who were allegedly followers of the now-suspended madrasa principal Sirajuddaula. The 18-year-old girl was attacked for refusing to withdraw a case her family filed last month against Sirajuddaula for sexually harassing and assaulting her. Her family filed another case against eight people—including Sirajuddaula—on April 8 for the attack on Nusrat. That case was later accepted as a murder case. Sirajuddaula, who was arrested after the first case was filed, is currently behind bars, with six others accused.",{},"['filed', 'oneday', 'murder', 'nusrat', 'hossain', 'sent', 'threeday', 'jail', 'court', 'case', 'remand', 'accused', 'produced']","Police escort Jobayer Ahmed, a key accused in the Nusrat Jahan Rafi murder case, at the Feni court premises on Sunday, April 21, 2019 Dhaka TribuneThey have confessed to their involvement in Nusrat's murderA Feni court has sent three accused in the case filed for the murder of madrasa student Nusrat Jahan Rafi, back to jail – after their one-day remand.

Elton John and Prince Harry launch bid to 'smash' AIDS stigma,'Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effects on education and other community services for not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment',,2018-07-24,Dhaka Tribune,"Prince Harry (left) and Sir Elton John attend a session about the Elton John AIDS Fund on the second day of the AIDS 2018 conference in Amsterdam on Tuesday AFP Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effects on education and other community services for not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment Elton John joined forces with Britains Prince Harry to launch a $1.2 billion initiative on Tuesday to ""break the cycle"" of HIV transmission by targeting young men, among whom infections are on the rise. On the second day of a major international AIDS conference in Amsterdam, the two lent their mega-wattage star power to calls for action to end the lingering stigma around the virus and protect generations to come. ""Young people are the only age group where HIV infections are rising, not falling,"" warned rock star and veteran AIDS campaigner Elton John as he announced the launch of the MenStar Coalition. ""We have to do much, much more to bring men, especially younger men more fully into the fold,"" he insisted. The coalition brings together different partners, including the UNs Unitaid and the US fund PEPFAR, as John warned that 24- to 35-year-old men were accessing HIV testing and treatment at ""unacceptably low rates"". Much work has been done to protect women and girls but ""we cant solve the whole problem if we are only addressing half the situation,"" John said. ""If we want to win this fight, if we want to end AIDS once and for all, we must make men part of the solution"" and teach them to protect themselves, ""not only their wives and girlfriends, their sisters, and daughters, but also critically their brothers and their sons."" Some 15,000 delegates -- researchers, campaigners, activists and people living with the HIV virus which causes AIDS -- have gathered for the five-day war council, amid dire warnings the AIDS epidemic could yet spiral out of control. ""The progress we have fought so hard for is at risk from a dangerous complacency,"" Prince Harry told conference delegates ""Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effects on education and other community services for not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment."" The new initiative was focused on ""the tough but essential work of truly changing mindsets,"" the Duke of Sussex said. ""Inspired by the growing alarm of the rate of new HIV infections among young women, this campaign is bravely tackling the root of this problem -- the lack of awareness of HIV prevention amongst hard-to-reach young men."" He urged people to unite around the ""smashing of a deadly stigma"" surrounding HIV, ""and calling out the prejudice that is still there"". South African actress Charlize Theron agreed as she addressed the days opening plenary session entitled: ""Breaking the barriers of inequity"". ""We have come a long way as a global community from that moral panic that defined early stages of this epidemic,"" she told the audience. But she warned that ""most of us now know and understand that HIV is not just about sex or sexuality... We know it is linked to the second-class status of women and girls worldwide.""",{},"['protect', 'launch', 'harry', 'elton', 'young', 'john', 'women', 'hiv', 'smash', 'prevention', 'bid', 'aids', 'men', 'prince', 'warned', 'stigma']","""Young people are the only age group where HIV infections are rising, not falling,"" warned rock star and veteran AIDS campaigner Elton John as he announced the launch of the MenStar Coalition.

Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan yesterday said value added tax (VAT) registration would be made mandatory for all traders from the next 2019-20 fiscal year. Currently, VAT registration is not mandatory for those having annual turnover below than Tk8, 000,000. “Whatever the VAT slabs will be fixed, VAT registration will be mandatory for all traders across the country from the next fiscal year. Without having the registration, no one would be allowed to do their business,” he said. He came up with the announcement while addressing a pre-budget discussion with different business associations at the NBR office. Business leaders of Bangladesh Paper Mills Association, Courier service Association and Hotel Restaurant Owners Association took part in the discussion program. NBR chief said they are going to introduce sector-wise multiple VAT slabs from the next fiscal year. “The rate of VAT will be fixed at 15% for those who can take rebate, and others rates will be announced in the budget documents,” added Bhuiyan. The much talked-about Value Added Tax and Supplementary Duty Act, 2012 was supposed to be implemented in FY 2017-18. However, the government could not implement the Act amid stiff opposition from business groups, and suspended it for two years. As per the decision of the government, the act will be effective from 2019-20 fiscal. Urging the traders to be honest in keeping their accounts formally, Hossain said some traders were maintaining two accounts of their businesses intentionally to evade taxes. “This is not fair at all,” he added, saying that all traders must use electronic fiscal devices for ensuring fair accounts. In his speech, he said that the government would continue tax incentive facility for some vital sectors, but it would be impossible for the government to maintain similar advantage for too many sectors. “We observed some enterprises could not do well despite having fiscal incentives, though before the privilege they had assured us of performing well if incentive was granted ,” NBR chairman said. So the NBR decided to rationalize the number of eligible sectors for incentives, he said, adding that incentives sometimes dent competitiveness in the market.",{},"['nbr', 'tax', 'mandatory', 'business', 'vat', 'fiscal', 'registration', 'chairman', 'traders', 'act', 'value', 'added']","Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan yesterday said value added tax (VAT) registration would be made mandatory for all traders from the next 2019-20 fiscal year.

Why Pakistan cannot say sorry to Bangladesh,Any apology to Bangladesh would imply that Pakistan's use of terror was self-destructive,,2018-04-26,Dhaka Tribune,"For some time now, Bangladesh has been pressing Pakistan to apologize for the genocide of the Bangali population in 1971. The occupation army showed no compunction in butchering an estimated three million of their (mostly unarmed) fellow citizens over a nine-month period to quell a liberation struggle in its then eastern wing. In reply, Pakistan has urged Bangladesh to forget the unfortunate incidents of the past and move on to a new, better relationship. Well short of an apology, its utterly inadequate response glosses over what remains the most shameful blot in Pakistan’s less-than-stellar history. However, given Pakistan’s gradual morphing into a terror-sponsoring state from its theocratic origins, beginning from its intervention in the Afghan civil war, its refusal to apologize to Bangladesh is not surprising. Countries with a firmer commitment to a democratic system and minimal respect for established norms of governance would have found it easier to offer a brief, heartfelt apology. A dignified regret would have helped Islamabad get rid of a permanent embarrassment in a civilized manner. If anything, by demanding an apology instead of adequate reparations, Bangladesh had prepared the ground for a graceful ending to a painful episode of history and for a new beginning in bilateral ties. Evidently, the army-dominated deep state in Pakistan has little concern for either the country’s international image, its place in world history, to say nothing of the damaging legacy it leaves behind for its younger generations. So far so bad -- yet it is possible to see the signs of a major political change for the better among the younger Pakistani citizens, which augurs well for South Asia. From Pakistan’s point of view, any apology to Bangladesh would have implied that its use of terror as an instrument of state policy had proved self-destructive. Its exploitative policy towards its eastern province was morally reprehensible and utterly wrong. More importantly, to disavow terror as an acceptable political tactic would have significantly reduced Pakistan’s acceptability among organizations like the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, the Lashkar–e-Toiba (some of which are internationally blacklisted), and their shadowy underworld backers. Pakistan’s refusal to apologize to Bangladesh even in 2018 indicates how little the country has changed since 1971 So there could be no apology to anyone on the break-up of 1971, because that would have meant a loss of face for the India-hating Pakistani ruling establishment. For the military hawks, drug lords, and Islamic extremists running Islamabad’s foreign policy, it was preferable to go along with international Muslim terrorism and maintain a pro-Jihadi image post-1971. After the emergence of Bangladesh, Pakistan became blindsided on the east. It opted wholeheartedly to concentrate on and participate in developments more closely in the deeply disturbed West Asian region. If this meant inviting unrest and chaos, there were compensations too. So long as the US and the EU continued to use Islamabad as their ally in the battle against Islamic terrorism, the dollars kept coming -- never mind the international revulsion and the moral opprobrium, which can be borne better when people are well-fed and elections are a joke. It is another matter that the US and the West have gradually become wiser to the implications of Pakistan’s running with the hares and hunting also with the hounds, in the matter of fighting Islamic extremism. Pakistan’s refusal to apologize to Bangladesh even in 2018 indicates how little the country has changed since 1971. And yet, it is not fair to condemn Pakistan as a country for the shocking killing of nearly three million people in 1971. There are any number of ordinary, decent Pakistani citizens who deeply regret the breaking up of their country and the loss of its eastern wing. Mostly these are younger generation Pakistanis who have no direct experience of the Liberation War in Bangladesh. But there are elder citizens too, including senior people in the administration, in different political parties, not to mention journalists and members of the commentariat who are bitterly critical of the 1971 break-up. There are several Pakistani TV channels where the younger set are shown discussing how Bangladesh has left Pakistan well behind in creating better health facilities for the people, in women empowerment, poverty reduction, family planning, and general education. Pakistan may boast of having more cars than Bangladesh and smartphones, but the former eastern province enjoys better forex reserves ($32 billion as against $14bn), more mobiles (84% of people as against 68%), registers a better GDP growth, and less foreign debt, despite receiving only a fraction of Pakistan’s level of foreign aid. The average Pakistani is marginally healthier than the Bangladeshi, but joblessness in Pakistan is much more than pronounced, not to mention the terrorism-related violence and the socio/political cost thereof. The fact that Bangladesh is poised to reach a GDP of over $273bn by end 2018 and overtake Pakistan’s GDP by 2021 at present rates is highly appreciated. Bangladesh does not suffer crippling power cuts like Pakistan, consuming around 16,000 megawatts daily, a figure expected to touch 22,000 MWs in the 2020s. In garments exports, it ranks second in the world. By 2021, along with Myanmar and Laos, Bangladesh is poised to join the ranks of middle-income countries, an elevation from the ranks of 47 least developed countries, at its present rate of growth -- in the sectors of personal income, economic vulnerability, and human assets creation. It needs stressing here that the present writer has taken these figures mostly covering the 2016-17 period, from Pakistani print and electronic media. Especially on TV channels, it has been heartening to see young Pakistanis listening with interest to the Bangladeshi national anthem and wishing their “brothers in the East all well.” It was also encouraging to see similar programs related to the present status and growth of major Indian cities like Kolkata on some Pakistani channels where most people expressed their appreciation. Their obvious interest in the economic growth of Bangladesh and India was a healthy sign for the political future of South Asia as a whole. As for reactions in India to developments in Bangladesh and Pakistan, especially among the young, this writer can personally confirm that there exist a matching interest and curiosity to learn more about their (former compatriots and current) neighbours with whom they have so much in common in terms of food, language, culture, and religion. As analyst Charubrata Ray puts it: “When today’s young generation assumes power in all three countries of the sub-continent, who knows what new possibilities may open up? Maybe Pakistan will unhesitatingly apologize to Bangladesh and India, and Pakistan may well apologize to each other -- and a new era of hope may prevail in South Asia?” An added point of interest is that of late, even blaming India for “having taken advantage of the problems in Bangladesh” is no longer done by the older generation of Pakistanis with the anger and vigour of the past. Col Sabyasachi Bagchi says, “they agree that if they were in Mrs Indira Gandhi’s place, they would have done exactly the same in Bangladesh, in a world dominated by realpolitik.” Ashis Biswas writes from Kolkata, India.",{},"['india', 'present', 'pakistan', 'apologize', 'political', 'pakistans', 'bangladesh', 'sorry', 'younger', 'pakistani', 'say', 'better']","For some time now, Bangladesh has been pressing Pakistan to apologize for the genocide of the Bangali population in 1971.

India votes in penultimate phase of election,Votes will be counted on May 23,,2019-05-12,Dhaka Tribune,"A man holding a child reacts behind a voting compartment as he prepares to cast his vote at a polling station during the sixth phase of the general election, in New Delhi, India, May 12, 2019 Reuters Votes will be counted on May 23 Voters in Delhi and elsewhere in India’s north have lined up to cast their ballots in the second-to-last round of a seven-phase general election, with the opposition seeking a united stand to deny Prime Minister Narendra Modi a second term. Voting in the sixth phase began early on Sunday. More than 100 million people across seven states are eligible to vote in the sixth phase of the 39-day-long poll, which Modi began on April 11 as front-runner after an escalation of tension with neighbouring Pakistan. But diverse opposition parties have recently taken heart at what they see as signs Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may be losing ground and have begun negotiations over a post-election alliance even before polling ends on May 19. Votes will be counted on May 23. Some voters in Delhi said they were backing Modi because they were won over by his tough stand on security.

Political analysts say that state-based and caste-driven parties could be decisive in determining the make-up of the next government, as a lack of new jobs and weak farm prices have hurt the BJP. “Regional parties will play a bigger role compared to the previous 5 years or even 15 years,” said K C Suri, a political science professor at the University of Hyderabad. “They will regain their importance in national politics.” Recent weeks have also been marked by personal attacks between leaders, including comments from Modi about the family of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty. At a recent rally Modi called Gandhi’s late father, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, “corrupt no. 1”. The BJP says Modi was reacting to Rahul Gandhi calling him a thief. “The political vitriolic has become intense, and negatively intense,” said Ashok Acharya, a political science professor at the University of Delhi. “It seems as if this particular election is all about a few political personalities.

The 83-year-old Nobel peace laureate, who fled to India in early 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, lives in exile in the northern hill town of Dharamshala. ""His Holiness is doing fine now,"" Tseten Samdup Chhoekyapa, the Dalai Lamas press secretary, told Reuters, without giving details. The Dalai Lama, who was diagnosed with a chest infection after being admitted to hospital on Tuesday, complaining of discomfort, will spend a few days in hospital, his personal secretary said. A hospital official declined to comment on his medical condition, citing patient confidentiality. Many of his supporters posted messages on social media wishing him a speedy recovery. ""Concerned that he has been hospitalized,"" tweeted Naveen Patnaik, chief minister of Indias eastern state of Odisha. ""The world needs him."" About 100,000 Tibetans live in India and many worry that their fight for a genuinely autonomous homeland would end with the Dalai Lama. He told Reuters last month his incarnation could be found in India after he dies, and warned that any other successor named by China would not be respected. China, which took control of Tibet in 1950, brands him a dangerous separatist and has said its leaders have the right to approve his successor, as a legacy from Chinas emperors. But many Tibetans, whose tradition holds that the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death, suspect any Chinese role as a ploy to exert influence on the community. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing he was not aware of the Dalai Lamas physical condition, but added, ""The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should follow the relevant Chinese laws, regulations and religious rituals.""",{},"['admitted', 'tibet', 'hospital', 'lama', 'told', 'tibetans', 'chinese', 'tibetan', 'recovers', 'dalai', 'infection', 'india', 'chest']","Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama arrives for his visit to the Tibet Institute Rikon in Rikon, Switzerland September 21, 2018 ReutersThe 83-year-old Nobel peace laureate was admitted to hospital in New DelhiThe Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was admitted to hospital in the Indian capital of New Delhi with a chest infection, but is doing fine, an aide said on Wednesday, as social media users prayed for the Buddhist monk's fast recovery.

Restaurant grading system launched,"Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder awarded green stickers to 18 restaurants, and blue stickers to 39 restaurants",,2019-01-20,Dhaka Tribune,"A Dhaka restaurateur receives an A+ grading certificate from Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder during the launching ceremony of a restaurant grading system in the capital on Sunday; January 20, 2019 Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder awarded green stickers to 18 restaurants, and blue stickers to 39 restaurants The Bangladesh Food Safety Authority (BFSA) on Sunday launched a restaurant grading system to help consumers determine the hygiene and quality of food at eateries. Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder inaugurated the launching ceremony of the system held in Dhaka, and officially awarded 57 restaurants after intense scrutiny by the BFSA, with green and blue coloured stickers. The coloured stickers—green, blue, yellow, and orange—symbolize the grades A+, A, B, and C respectively. The green sticker stands for excellent and is only awarded to restaurants that score 90 points or above, while the blue sticker represents good and is awarded to restaurants that receive 80–89 points. A yellow sticker represents an average score of 60–79 points, while orange stands for a pending grade for restaurants which score 59 points or lower. Highlighting the need for more manpower, Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder said that many food control officers at the district and upazila levels can also be used to ensure quality food production. He also urged cooperation of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health. Restaurants will be given points based on 10 criteria: necessary proof or certification documents, staff hygiene, approved sources, relative contamination, cleanliness, processing procedures and temperature control, equipment and machinery, chemical substances, pest and insect control, and drainage and pipe management. Speaking at the event, BFSA Chairman Mohammad Mahfuzul Hoque also announced that they will launch a mobile app to help consumers determine the grades of nearby restaurants. The system has been implemented in the capitals Motijheel, Dilkhusha, and Paltan areas. The green stickers were awarded to 18 restaurants including Kosturi, Handi, Kinnori, Hotel Asia and Resources, and seven branches of Burger King. As many as 39 restaurants have been awarded blue stickers. “We will review the grading of restaurants to ensure continuous hygiene and quality maintenance. If the authority finds any negligence after grading, restaurants will lose their grade. Similarly, a restaurant may also improve and be eligible to move up to the next level in the grading system,” said Mahfuzul. Restaurants with yellow stickers will be given three months to improve, but restaurants with orange stickers will be given just one month. “If these [C-graded] restaurants fail to improve, then their establishments will be barred from operating,” the BFSA chairman added. Speaking at the event, Bangladesh Restaurant Owners Association (BROA) Secretary General, M Rezaul Karim Sarkar Robin, said grading will help encourage restaurant owners to comply with BFSA standards.",{},"['blue', 'launched', 'awarded', 'sadhan', 'grading', 'restaurant', 'food', 'system', 'stickers', 'bfsa', 'restaurants']","A Dhaka restaurateur receives an A+ grading certificate from Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder during the launching ceremony of a restaurant grading system in the capital on Sunday; January 20, 2019 Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka TribuneFood Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder awarded green stickers to 18 restaurants, and blue stickers to 39 restaurantsThe Bangladesh Food Safety Authority (BFSA) on Sunday launched a restaurant grading system to help consumers determine the hygiene and quality of food at eateries.

Netflix gets permission to place cache servers in Bangladesh,"Their estimation says if each subscriber pays $9 to Netflix each month, then the company earns $1.8 million or Tk15 crore each month. According to that estimation, Netflix yearly earns more than Tk180 crore from Bangladesh alone and these numbers are increasing",,2019-05-11,Dhaka Tribune,"Their estimation says if each subscriber pays $9 to Netflix each month, then the company earns $1.8 million or Tk15 crore each month. According to that estimation, Netflix yearly earns more than Tk180 crore from Bangladesh alone and these numbers are increasing Licensed National Internet Exchange (NIX) operators of Bangladesh can now place cache servers for Netflix, world’s leading subscription-based streaming service which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs. The announcement came from a Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) meeting on April 30. Netflix streaming cache servers, with their Open Connect Appliances (OCAs), in local Internet Service Providers (ISP) data centres will increase streaming speeds for Bangladeshi users. BTRC, responsible for regulating all telecommunications matters of Bangladesh, has granted permission to licensed internet exchanges after several International Internet Gateways (IIG) and local Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Summit Communications, Aamra Technologies, Link3 Technologies, Amber IT, and Mazeda Network applied for permission to place Netflix cache servers for their customers. Some of these ISPs even have NIX licenses. Netflix, a US based Video On Demand (VOD) service, has more than 200,000 subscribers in Bangladesh, according to estimates of BTRC and a private management consulting firm, PI Strategy. Their estimation says if each subscriber pays nine US dollars to Netflix each month, then the company earns $1.8 million or Tk15 crore each month. According to that estimation, Netflix yearly earns more than Tk180 crore from Bangladesh alone and these numbers are increasing. The streaming platform has almost 150 million subscribers in 190 countries across the globe, except in mainland China (due to local restrictions) as well as Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to US sanctions). Yet they are also getting widely popular over Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and numerous other ways, in countries where Netflix is not available. Local experts have also said there is no stopping its widespread use, so BTRC has decided to permit local licensed internet exchanges to place Netflix’s cache servers for their clients, to improve streaming quality and not have to purchase costly international bandwidth. In their latest meeting, BTRC officials discussed the applications from IIGs and ISPs. The commissions (Engineering and Operations) department discussed detailed pros and cons of placing Netflix’s cache servers in Bangladesh. They also advised placing these servers at National Internet Exchange (NIX) operators’ ends, rather than ISP ends. They said there are more than a thousand ISPs around the country, so moderating them would be a very tough challenge, but there are only six licensed NIX operators, which would be far more manageable for the BTRC. The commission meeting also talked about Netflix’s cloud based services, how viewers need to register, subscribe and pay its monthly fees by international credit card, so no other party except Netflix gets paid in this process, and also how this is getting popular among audiences around the globe, including Bangladesh. The company has placed more than ten thousand servers across the planet, each of them can transfer data to their clients’ end at a staggering 10 terabyte per second speed. Most of these servers are placed in Europe or the US. Top Indian ISPs have recently also placed Netflix cache servers to meet their clients streaming demands | Netflix Media Center In Bangladesh, these services were being provided by local ISPs who had to buy International bandwidth at a higher rate. They could not earn anything from these costs they had to cover, but the rise of the platform’s popularity and their client demands, compelled them to stay in this international race. With the permission of placing Netflix servers inside the country, local internet providers can provide faster Netflix streaming speeds, save a lot of money which was being spent outside the country, and was a huge loss for them. Previously, BTRC has permitted Google, Facebook, and YouTube to place cache servers in Bangladesh to improve services for their clients.",{},"['place', 'streaming', 'isps', 'btrc', 'permission', 'bangladesh', 'local', 'servers', 'international', 'internet', 'cache', 'netflix', 'gets']","Netflix streaming cache servers, with their Open Connect Appliances (OCAs), in local Internet Service Providers' (ISP) data centres will increase streaming speeds for Bangladeshi users.

The Economist: Bangladesh’s GDP per capita now higher than Pakistan’s,Bangladesh soared ahead owing to an increased population in Pakistan,,2017-09-08,Dhaka Tribune,"August revealed a remarkable turnaround for Bangladeshs GDP per person of $1,538, which is higher than that of Pakistans GDP per person, standing at $1,470. The respective currencies were converted into dollars at market exchange rates for the calculation of the GDP per head. After gaining independence from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh was left in dire circumstances where the industry accounted for only 6-7% GDP, compared to Pakistans 20%. The battle for independence led to the displacement of million lives and damaged infrastructure, while Pakistans bankers and industrialists severed ties with the newly formed country. However, Bangladesh rose from the ashes of the past and transformed itself into a state of flourishing economic growth. Bangladesh moved ahead because of a rise in population in Pakistan, updating earlier population estimates to 207.8 million people, which is 9 million more than previously thought. Therefore, the new count also knocked off 4-5% off Pakistan’s GDP per person. The arithmetic consequence and revealing an estimate of too many people in Pakistan worked as an advantage for Bangladesh. However, Pakistans $1,470 GDP per person actually has more purchasing power than Bangladeshs $1,538, as a dollar stretches further in Pakistan than in Bangladesh because prices in the former tend to be lower. Bangladeshs economic progress must be celebrated, since its annual growth has averaged more than 6% over the past ten years and has run above 7% over the past two. Industry accounts for 29% of its GDP. Bangladeshs GDP per capita received a boost from another source. Its last census, in 2011, led to a large revision of the country’s population, larger even than Pakistans. But in Bangladeshs case, the revision was downwards. Bangladesh, one of the primary exporters of ready-made clothes across the world, now exports more ready-made garments than India and Pakistan combined. Even though working conditions are still mediocre, Bangladesh has come a long way and doing far better than they once were.",{},"['economist', 'pakistan', 'revision', 'person', 'pakistans', 'bangladesh', 'bangladeshs', 'capita', 'gdp', 'past', 'million', 'population', 'higher']","August revealed a remarkable turnaround for Bangladesh's GDP per person of $1,538, which is higher than that of Pakistan's GDP per person, standing at $1,470.

A shift to a more merit-based system prioritizing high-skilled workers would mark a dramatic departure from the nation’s largely family-based approach, which officials said gives roughly 66% of green cards to those with family ties and only 12% based on skills. But the plan, which is set to be rolled out on Thursday but has yet to be embraced by Trump’s own party ”let alone Democrats” faces an uphill battle in Congress. Efforts to overhaul the immigration system have gone nowhere for three decades amid deeply divided Republicans and Democrats. Prospects for an agreement seem especially bleak as the 2020 elections near, though the plan could give Trump and the GOP a proposal to rally behind, even if talks with Democrats go nowhere. The plan does not address what to do about the millions of immigrants already living in the country illegally, including hundreds of thousands of young “Dreamers” brought to the US as children ” a top priority for Democrats. Nor does it reduce overall rates of immigration, as many conservative Republicans would like to see. Trump will nonetheless deliver a Rose Garden speech Thursday throwing his weight behind the plan, which has thus far received mixed reviews from Republicans in the Senate. In briefings Wednesday that attracted dozens of journalists, administration officials said the plan would create a points-based visa system, similar to those used by Canada and other countries. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline the plan before Trump’s announcement, said the US would award the same number of green cards as it now does. But far more would go to exceptional students so they can remain in the country after graduation, professionals and people with high-level and vocational degrees. Factors such as age, English language ability and employment offers would also be taken into account. Far fewer green cards would be given to people with relatives already in the US and 57% versus the current 12% would be awarded based on merit. The diversity visa lottery, which offers green cards to citizens of countries with historically low rates of immigration to the US, would be eliminated. Officials insisted diversity would be addressed in other ways. The officials offered fewer specifics on border security, which is expected to remain a key focus for Trump as he campaigns for reelection. Trump has been furiously railing against the spike in Central American migrant families trying to enter the country, and he forced a government shutdown in a failed effort to fulfill his 2016 promise to build a southern border wall. As part of the plan, officials want to shore up ports of entry to ensure all vehicles and people are screened and to create a self-sustaining fund, paid for with increased fees, to modernize ports of entry. The plan also calls for building border wall in targeted locations and continues to push for an overhaul to the US asylum system, with the goal of processing fewer applications and removing people who don’t qualify faster. While the officials insisted their effort was not a “political” plan, they nonetheless framed it as one they hoped Republicans would unite behind, making clear to voters what the party is “for.” “I don’t think it’s designed to get Democratic support as much as it is to unify the Republican Party around border security, a negotiating position,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of the White House. Indeed, the plan drew immediate criticism from Democrats as well as immigration activists, who remain deeply skeptical of Trump after past negotiation failures. Democrats and some Republicans tried crafting a compromise with Trump last year that would have helped young Dreamer immigrants and added money for border security. But those talks collapsed over White House demands to curb legal immigration and a dramatic Senate showdown in which lawmakers rejected three rival proposals that aligned with the “four pillars” immigration plan Trump unveiled that year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the White House for failing to engage in talks with Democrats over the latest proposal. “Don’t come up with a plan that Stephen Miller rubber stamps and say, ‘Now, pass it.’ It’s not going to happen,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said, referring to Trump’s hard-line policy adviser.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration rates, applauded a “very positive effort” on legal immigration, but said it was “undermined by the embrace of the current very high level of immigration.” Republicans on the Hill, too, voiced skepticism, even as administration officials insisted the plan had been embraced by those who briefed on it. A PowerPoint presentation shared with reporters Wednesday referred to the plan as “The Republican Proposal,” even though many GOP members had yet to see it. Graham, who rolled out his own proposal Wednesday to address the recent flood of migrants seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border, said he had advised Trump to try to cut a new deal with Democrats and believed Trump was open to that. “I am urging the president to lead us to a solution,” he said.",{},"['plan', 'changes', 'immigration', 'system', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'proposal', 'green', 'officials', 'trump', 'card', 'border', 'security', 'drive']","Efforts to overhaul the immigration system have gone nowhere for three decades amid deeply divided Republicans and Democrats.
