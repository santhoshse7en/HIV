Mumbai's civic hospital doctors operate on HIV-TB patient,"MUMBAI: In a rare feat in a public hospital, a 50-year-old patient with dual infection of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV was operated a.",Tnn,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: In a rare feat in a public hospital, a 50-year-old patient with dual infection of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV was operated at civic-run TB Hospital in Sewri on Friday. HIV and TB, both highly infectious, need special arrangements and the use of extra disposable material that add to the cost of surgery in the private sector. This is the second time a patient with HIV and TB was operated at the hospital. Our honorary surgeons regularly operate on TB patients, but such a supra-major surgery is rare, said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent of the hospital. Surgery on the earlier co-infection patient was done over three years back. The present patient, on anti-retroviral therapy for HIV\AIDS since 2009, was diagnosed with multi-drug resistant TB in October 2018. He came with severe breathing difficulty about 10 days back, said Dr Anande. Doctors realized the TB infection affected his respiratory system so severely that only an operation could provide immediate relief. The surgical team performed decortication, a medical procedure involving surgical removal of the surface layer covering of an organ. The procedure is usually performed when the lung is covered by a thick, inelastic pleural peel restricting lung expansion. The lungs are covered by a thin membrane called pleura that is thinner than tissue paper. The TB infection makes this pleura thicker, said cardiothroracic and vascular surgeon Dr Amol Bhanushali, who was in the team that operated on the patient. Dr Amol Bhanusali said the patients pleura had became thick with consistency of curd, preventing the lungs from expanding during breathing. It took us three hours to open up his chest and remove the pleura, he added. The patients lungs were not severely affected by the TB bacterium and medicines should now help him recover. The patient is recovering and had his meals on Monday but as his immune system is weak, he will need 15 more days of hospitalization, said Dr Anande. TB activist Ganesh Acharya said this was a positive development as many patients with HIV-MDR TB co-infection find it difficult to access healthcare. Surgery is an option for patients in whom recovery with drugs alone is not possible. The government must provide modern operating theatres so doctors can operate on such patients safely, he added.

""We have arrested a doctor after receiving complaints from the health authorities,"" said Kamran Nawaz, the local police chief heading the case in the southern city of Larkana. ""We are told that the doctor also has HIV,"" he said. Authorities were first alerted last week after 18 children from a town on the outskirts of the city tested positive for the virus, which causes AIDS, prompting health officials to carry out wider screenings. Dozens more infections were found. ""More than 90 people have tested HIV positive and the number of children is around 65,"" Dr Abdul Rehaman, a district health official in Larkana, told AFP. A second official confirmed the outbreak, although gave slightly different figures. Authorities said they traced the outbreak to a single doctor, who appears to have been using a contaminated syringe on patients. Azra Pechuho, Sindh province's health minister, confirmed his arrest. ""The blood of the parents of the infected children was also tested, but their results were negative,"" Pechuho added. Officials have since launched an even larger testing and education drive.

No. of pregnant women testing HIV+ dips; still over 600 this year,"MUMBAI: Despite significant progress in containing the spread of HIV among the general population, over 600 pregnant women have tested positive for th.",,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: Despite significant progress in containing the spread of HIV among the general population, over 600 pregnant women have tested positive for the virus in the state this year. In the last five years, over 6,300 women were detected with the virus during pregnancy, underlining the urgent need to reach out to people who may be living with the virus but are unaware of their status. This World AIDS Day, as there is a global clamour for expansion of HIV-testing and treatment under the theme of Know your status, activists demanded that government agencies must push facilities deeper into the community. Dr Ashok Anand, who heads the gynaecology department at JJ Hospital, that carries out a massive volume of HIV positive childbirths, said even today, hundreds of women find out their status only during their pregnancy. Most women get the infection from husbands. In fact, many husbands know about their HIV status only when their wives are pregnant, said Dr Anand. Data from Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 92% of infections are due to unsafe sex, a significant percentage of which is among heterosexual couples. The remaining are caused by transfusion with infected blood, use of infected needles or from mother to child. Dr Anand said prevention was better as always, as an infected mother also stands the risk of passing on the virus to the child. While with multiple-drug regimen the incidence of mother-to-child transmission has reduced a great deal, some babies continue to get the infection from mothers. Since 2014-15, nearly 300 babies have got HIV infection from mothers in the state. Activist Ganesh Acharya said it was time to remodel targeted interventions and penetrate communities deeper. We need more behaviour change communication to encourage more to get tested, he said, adding that people still getting HIV in large numbers suggest that programmes may be failing. Maharashtra State Aids Control Organisation (MDACS) officials said a decade ago more than 4,000 pregnant women tested positive every year. The number of women testing positive declined by 85% over 10 years, even as women being screened more than doubled, said a senior official. He said from nearly 8 lakh in 2008, over 21 lakh pregnant women were now being screened annually in Maharashtra. MDACS assistant project director Dr Shrikala Acharya said to facilitate testing BMC has tied up with 113 outlets of Metropolis where HIV test will be carried out for Rs75 for a week from December 1.

Transfusion of HIV blood: Panel seeks time till January 9 to give report,CHENNAI: After two lab technicians failed to turn up before the committee appointed by the health department to probe the case of pregnant women given.,Tnn,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: After two lab technicians failed to turn up before the committee appointed by the health department to probe the case of pregnant women given HIV-infected blood, the panel has sought for an extension till January 9 to submit to its report. On December 26, health secretary J Radhakrishnan issued a government order asking a six-member committee under the chairmanship of additional director of medical services Dr S Madhavi to inquire into the case and submit a report in a week. The panel, comprised of senior doctors including Madras Medical College professor of internal medicine Dr S Raghunandhan, Tirunelveli Medical College professor of blood transfusion Dr S A Manimala and Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University associate professor Dr Swathandran Hamsawardhini, began its probe on December 28 The team, however, could not complete the inquiry on time as two lab technicians failed to depose before the committee. It is not binding on them to appear before the committee. So, we cannot bring them by force. But we wanted to give them a chance to give their version, a member of the committee said. Preliminary inquiries conducted by a team led by Virudhunagar joint director (health) Dr Manohar found that officials at the blood bank and HIV/AIDS counsellors had erred at least twice before they transfused the HIV-infected blood to the woman. In 2016, the donor had given blood at a camp in Sattur in Virudhunagar district. The government hospital there tested the sample positive for HIV but the counsellor at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre failed to inform the donor of his status. When he gave blood a second time in November, the blood was issued to a pregnant woman in Sivakasi. The testing kit used by the PHC is reliable and is supplied by NACO for centres across India. So far, it does not look like a machine error. We want the technicians to tell us what went wrong, said a senior doctor.

HIV+ve girl child: Committee conducts inquiry at government hospitals,TIRUPUR: The national commission for protection of child rights (NCPCR) recently conducted an investigation at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hosp.,Tnn,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"TIRUPUR: The national commission for protection of child rights (NCPCR) recently conducted an investigation at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) after the parents of a two-year-old girl alleged that their child was infected with HIV after undergoing blood transfusion at the hospital. The committee headed by NCPCR member Dr RG Anand also visited the child while she availed treatment at the Tirupur Government Hospital on Thursday. The district administration will soon submit a report on the condition of the child and the financial status of her family. CMCH doctors had confirmed that the child was affected with HIV when she was admitted there last month. Though authorities were yet to confirm the source of infection, her parents alleged that red blood cells transfused on July 12, 2018, could be the source of infection. Though the parents were asked to visit CMCH, as the commission wanted to meet them, they refused to go there. As the girl was ill, the parents took her to the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Center at the Tirupur Government Hospital on Wednesday. After conducting inquiries with CMCH authorities, the committee including Aravind of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) visited Tirupur GH. They met the girls mother at the general in-patient ward, where the girl was admitted, before having conversations with the hospital resident medical officer and superintendent. They wanted to understand about the condition of the girl and the financial condition of her family. NCPCR was pondering whether to provide any financial assistance to the family. Since the girls father was not present, they could not complete the inquiry, district child protection officer D Vasanth Kumar said. Meanwhile, the district administration will submit a report on the child to the state government soon. It is also planning to provide counselling to the family on HIV. The commission assured financial assistance to the family, the girls 27-year-old father, who works in a powerloom unit at Palladam taluk, told TOI. My wife told them that all we wanted is proper treatment for my child, one of our twins. The child was discharged from Tirupur GH on Friday after her condition improved.

The couple, who reside in Palladam taluk in Tirupur, don't want to take their child to the CMCH again. ""I firmly suspect that the blood transfused to our daughter at CMCH on July 12, 2018, is the source of infection. If the blood was uninfected, why did doctors remove it when not even half of it was transfused,"" the 27-year-old father of the victim said. ""After doctors confirmed the HIV infection on February 7, we took up the issue with CMCH dean Dr B Asokan, but he refuted our claims. So, we tried to lodge a complaint with the Race Course police. But police refused to take up the case saying the issue cannot be solved in police station,"" he said. ""The doctors were, however, preparing to discharge our child saying the disease could be cured. We urged them to provide treatment at the hospital itself. The baby was given medicines. On February 21, we discontinued the treatment fearing backlash as the issue was escalating. We left the hospital without informing the doctors,"" he said. The powerloom worker, who earns 10,000 a month, said, ""We do not want to go back to CMCH. All we want is that our daughter be given proper treatment. I am the only breadwinner in my family. The government should help us with the treatment.""

The teacher was left aghast when three cops came to his school after a warrant was issued to have him presented before the election officer. The 55-year-old teacher was teaching his Class I students when the cops arrived to escort him to the police station. The warrant was issued as he had failed to attend the election training session on April 14. ""I fulfilled all election duties for the last 22 years. This election, I got very unwell and fell unconscious and could not attend the training session. I wrote to the authorities explaining my HIV condition and the fact that I get very sick sometimes, and asked to be relieved from duty,"" said the teacher. The teacher says he got his statement recorded and had taken his medical file along with him. The matter was resolved when he agreed to carry out his election duties. ""I am not afraid of hard work. It is only that these days I have started falling sick when I get stressed and sometimes even pass out. It would have been better if I was relieved, but I will assume the duty,"" said the teacher, who has recently lost 10kg from his usual weight. ""Two people were served notices by the ARO (assistant returning officer) of Kankrej. No formal arrests were made. Both persons reported for duty,"" Banaskantha SP Pradip Sejul said. Deputy collector of Banaskantha S J Chavda said that warrant was issued under Section 134 of the Representation of the People Act.

It is important to address the myths around AIDS that have given rise to societal and cultural taboos related to the disease.AIDS is caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which is a virus that attacks the immune cells of the body. It also cannot spread by eating food with HIV patients, sharing utensils with them, or even kissing because the amount of HIV in the saliva is so less that it cannot infect anyone.

Mumbai: Free HIV tests at six railway stations for a week from Dec 1,"MUMBAI: In a bid to change the negative attitude towards HIV testing, Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) will offer free tests at six railwa.",,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: In a bid to change the negative attitude towards HIV testing, Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) will offer free tests at six railway stations with maximum footfalls on December 1, World AIDS Day. The test will be available for a week at Rs75 almost a fifth of the usual cost at 700 laboratories of the private Metropolis laboratory from December. We are focusing on normalising HIV testing, said Dr Shrikala Acharya of MDACS ahead of World AIDS Day, whose theme is Know your status. If tests are easily available at public places for free or at affordable rates, testing may be seen as a socially accepted concept. At present, if people are asked to undergo a test by their doctor or health worker, they will come up with an excuse or say this test is not for them as they are safe, she said. There are 38,000 people with the virus who have registered with MDACS in Mumbai city, but there is no corresponding estimate for the private sector so far. MDACS will put up kiosks at CSTM, Dadar, Kurla, Andheri, Ghatkopar and Borivli stations to make the test easily accessible. Experts admit that the stigma attached to HIV and AIDS is still high, preventing people from testing themselves, leading to a delay in the start of treatment. We want to make testing a social movement. It should be a normal question to ask each other if one has undergone the HIV test, she added. MDACS will carry out social media campaigns with Marathi film and TV actors to promote HIV testing. The idea is to create a social movement of sorts so that people forget the stigma attached to HIV testing, she said.

Gujarat fifth in HIV deaths in country,"AHMEDABAD: In the last three years, Gujarat saw an increase in Aids deaths, already raising alarm bells for the state government.",Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: In the last three years, Gujarat saw an increase in Aids deaths, already raising alarm bells for the state government. The state has the fifth highest deaths due to HIV infections in the country. In the last three financial years ending in 2017-18, Gujarat saw 8,086 deaths due to HIV or Aids; of these 2,819 died in 2017-18. In 2016-17 the state saw 2,640 HIV related deaths and in 2015-16 the previous year Gujarat saw 2,627 deaths due to the deadly disease. In its 2017 report, NACO had claimed that new pockets of infection had emerged in states like Gujarat, Bihar, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, and Jharkhand which needed close monitoring and tailored prevention and treatment programmes. The report also pointed out that the transmission dynamics between states caused by migration should be studied and should be recognised as a key driver of new HIV infections. Interestingly, against the rising number of HIV deaths the central allocation for Aids control has decreased for Gujarat. In 2015 the state was allocated Rs 5,674 cr which reduced to Rs 5,271 cr in 2017-18. The other states that have recorded high deaths due to Aids are Maharashtra with 10,061 deaths in 2017-18, in the same period Karnataka registered 8,126 deaths Tamil Nadu saw 4,314 deaths and UP, one of the largest states in the country witnessed 3,723 deaths.

Madurai: Woman injected with HIV+ blood now faces social stigma,MADURAI: The woman who was infected with HIV virus unintentionally and her husband fear the social stigma more than the disease itself.,Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The woman who was infected with HIV virus unintentionally and her husband fear the social stigma more than the disease itself. This is something the Madurai Network of Positive People (MNP+) says will be more difficult to deal with even though the infection was a result of transfusion. Her 27-year-old husband from Sattur said even his closest friends were standing several feet away when they came to see him. I dont blame them, he said. Woman who was given HIV+ blood gives birth to girlHe said he had refused to accept the two cents of land allocated by the government as compensation for the distress caused to them as it was situated about 15 kilometres from their present residence in Sattur. It is as if they had given us a secluded godforsaken place where others wouldnt interfere, but I want a place within the town though I can already see that we are going to be stigmatized, he said. HIV+ donor who infected woman tries to kill selfMNP+ president B V Babu, said there were 2,000 people in their positive living group almost all of who still experienced problems after coming out in the open about their HIV status. NACO (National AIDS Control Organization) went for care and support in the year 2012 though the issue of social stigma was not addressed properly. Now, no awareness is being created and it is getting worse, he said. Just a handful of people with HIV were working in public sector establishments and private offices. Otherwise, all of them were self-employed as other people in society were not ready to accept them as one of their own. I have a small agricultural farm, but even there I must listen to comments from the others in the village which can be hurtful, Babu said. When such people apply for the 1,000 monthly dole given by the government for their welfare, the revenue officials make inquiries in the neighbourhood. Thus, they come to know that they have an HIV/AIDS person in their midst and the discrimination starts there, he said. HIV positive people were also given priority in schemes like green houses but as verification was conducted to check this status, there had been cases of the neighbours becoming hostile and not allowing their children to play with their children, said Babu. R Kannan, secretary of the group, says that a former Madurai district collector asked them to stop distributing water from a can at the Government Rajaji Hospital in 2012 because people objected to it. Even the staff who work in the HIV/AIDS section in hospital consider it to be a demeaning job. So, how are they going to make the society see us in a better light? he said.

The woman, who got infected with HIV virus after she was given HIV positive blood on December 3 last year, had been under supervision and care of a special team of doctors in the Government Rajaji Hospital here since December 27, said hospital dean in-charge Dr S Shanmugasundaram. The woman went into labour and gave birth to the girl around 7pm on Thursday. The dean said the baby, weighing 1.75kg, was doing well and no birth defect had been noted. The mother was also doing well, he added. The infant was given nevirapine syrup to prevent HIV infection and immunoglobulin to prevent hepatitis B infection. As the baby was underweight, it has been kept in the warmer and will be given formula feed till it gains the desirable weight, the dean said. An HIV-infected mother cannot feed her baby for fear of transmitting the infection. HIV screening of the baby would be done only after 45 days, after which it would be known if the child was born with or without the infection, Shanmugasundaram added. On December 3, blood donated by an HIV-positive teenager was given to the woman when she was admitted to Sattur government hospital. The teenager donated blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realising that he was HIV infected. The teenager committed suicide after learning about his health condition.

Ganjam pitches for HIV test before marriage,BERHAMPUR: The Ganjam district administration has decided to intensify awareness among youngsters to screen their HIV/AIDS status before they decide t.,,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"BERHAMPUR: The Ganjam district administration has decided to intensify awareness among youngsters to screen their HIV/AIDS status before they decide to tie the knot. The drive is aimed at preventing the transmission of the virus to spouses and children born thereafter. District collector Vijay Amruta Kulange has asked the health officials in the district to take the initiative in this regard to arrest the spread of the virus. He made the announcement while reviewing the health programmes with the officials concerned at Chhatrapur, the district headquarters town, on Sunday. ""The collector instructed us to launch a drive to create massive awareness in this regard and we have also undertaken the drive to educate the younger generation about the benefits of the HIV test before marriage,"" said Hemant Kumar Das, project coordinator, Ganjam district AIDS control unit. Generally, the parents match horoscopes of their bride-to-be and would-be groom before their marriage. ""Along with the horoscopes, we also convince the parents to advise their wards go for HIV test before getting married,"" said Loknath Mishra, director of ARUNA, an NGO working in the field of AIDS. He said the spread of the virus can be controlled if the younger generation comes forward to undergo HIV test. ""We have decided to undertake massive awareness on testing of HIV before marriage this year in at least six high- risk and migration-prone blocks in the district,"" he said. The blocks are Aska, Purushottampur, Hinjili, Khallikote, Polasara and Beguniapada. He said some of the youngsters are convinced and promised to go for HIV test before marriage. The drive assumes significance as several couples have died of AIDS after their marriage in the district, an official said. Moreover, the district has the highest number of HIV- positive persons in the state. The district had the highest number of 15,673 HIV-positive persons by the end of March, official sources said. Das said in order to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child, they have been testing HIV status of all pregnant women in the district. The testing facility has been extended to all hospitals and ANM centres at the village level, he said. According to Das, general prevalance rate has not been counted so far. But they have found 0.25% prevalence rate among pregnant women in the district, which is not critical. Several HIV positive cases remain hidden among the youths without test. Screening before marriage can help persons take precaution if found to be HIV positive. This will also help arrest the spread of disease, Das said.

Health Minister C Vijayabaskar, replying to a calling attention motion on the issue in the state assembly, said three lab technicians had already been terminated for the lapse at the blood bank that led to transfusion of the blood donated by a 19-year-old man last month. Pregnant woman turns HIV positive after blood transfusionRaising the matter, Leader of the Opposition M K Stalin (DMK) and his party colleague KKSSR Ramachandran demanded action against those at the higher echelon of the administrative pyramid. HIV +ve Tamil Nadu teen who attempted suicide diesVijayabaskar, who described the incident as shocking, said a panel led by the Additional Director of Medical Services was looking into the issue to pinpoint where the lapse occurred in certifying the blood safe and assured appropriate action after the inquiry. The 24-year-old woman contracted HIV after the blood transfusion at a government hospital at Sattur in Virudhunagar distrit in the first week of December for treatment of haemoglobin deficiency. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation with opposition parties demanding the dismissal of the health minister and transfer of the state health secretary. The man, who attempted suicide after learning about the transfusion, died at a hospital on Sunday. Defending the blood screening process, Vijayabaskar said it was as per the National Aids Control Organisation guidelines and the government has also decided to go in for ID NAT (Individual Nucleic Acid Testing) technique for early detection of HIV. He said land allotment had already been made for the woman and the government was in touch with her family to ensure all required help was given.. Ramachandran said the episode has altered the life of an innocent woman and wanted job opportunity to her husband, and proper health care assistance to her and the foetus.

Autopsy performed on HIV+ve donor’s body at GRH,MADURAI: Postmortem was performed on the body of the HIV-positive blood donor who died while undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital here o.,Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: Postmortem was performed on the body of the HIV-positive blood donor who died while undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital here on Sunday, a few days after consuming poison. Hospital dean in-charge Dr S Shanmugasundaram said the postmortem was performed by a team of doctors led by Dr Selvaraj, head of the department of forensic medicine in Madurai Medical College, Dr Juliana, also from the college, and Dr Arunkumar and Dr R Chandrasekar from Theni Government MCH. The process was videographed as directed by the Madurai bench of the Madras high court and the body handed over to his parents. The postmortem, which was supposed to begin by 10am, was delayed following confusion over the high court direction. It began in the afternoon after the court clarified that two associate professors from Theni Government Medical College Hospital could assist the doctors here. The victims counsel pointed out that both doctors were taken from Theni while the court, on December 31, had directed that two assistant professors from either Theni or Sivaganga or Tirunelveli could participate in the postmortem. On Wednesday, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that since the postmortem would be videographed, there need not be any concern and gave the go-ahead. Earlier, on December 31, a special hearing was presided over by Justice Pugalendhi after the teenagers family moved the high court seeking postmortem of his body by two external doctors under video coverage. The court granted the relief sought by the family and also directed to videograph the postmortem. The teenager died on Sunday morning, a few days after consuming rat poison on Wednesday. The teenagers family members expressed suspicion over his death as he was a crucial witness in the case. They said the doctors in GRH, where he had been undergoing treatment after his suicide attempt, had hidden details from the family. The teenager, who had been working in a fireworks unit in Sivakasi, donated blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realising that he was HIV-infected. This blood was transfused to a 23-year-old pregnant woman on December 3 last year.

Madras HC directs to videograph HIV+ve donor’s autopsy,The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed that the postmortem of the 19-year-old HIV positive donor whose blood was transfused to,,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed that the postmortem of the 19-year-old HIV positive donor whose blood was transfused to an anaemic woman be conducted at the Madurai Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in the presence of two assistant professors from medical colleges of neighbouring districts. The bench also directed the dean to ensure that the autopsy was videographed from various angles. Justice B Pugalendhi, who took up the case at a special sitting, issued the directions after the deceased boys mother moved the court on Monday raising doubts over his death. The teenager had attempted suicide last Wednesday by consuming rat poison and was undergoing treatment at GRH, where he died on Sunday. The boy, who was working as a labourer at a fireworks unit in Sivakasi, had first donated blood at the blood bank on November 30 without realizing that he was HIV-infected. This blood was transfused to the 23-year-old pregnant woman on December 3 and she also got infected. In the petition, the woman stated that her son discontinued school in Class IX and went to work in Sivakasi in 2016 as a daily wage labourer. She said her son had to undergo a blood test for his job requirement abroad and the lab results showed him to be HIV positive after which he checked with the Sivakasi government hospital and found that his blood was transfused to a pregnant woman. In fact my son himself alerted the hospital officials about his infection after the private lab found him to be infected, the petitioner stated. After it was ascertained that a pregnant woman was infected with HIV, pictures of my son were showed on some television channels leading to his identification. Upset over this and lack of counselling, he attempted suicide on December 26. The petitioner stated that after three days of treatment at Madurai GRH, her son was back to normal. However, on December 30, around 5 am, three doctors and a nurse arrived after he complained of pain in his private parts. Three hours later, her son was declared dead. Stating that even the district collector was not informed of the boys death until evening, the family raised suspicions over the treatment offered in the last hour leading to his death. When the petition came up for hearing, Justice B Pugalendhi granted the relief sought by the family. The court directed that the autopsy be conducted as per rules laid down and directed two assistant professors from either Sivaganga, Tirunelveli or Theni medical colleges to assist in the autopsy. The court also made it clear that the relief granted in this case could not be a precedent in cases of suspicious death and it was granted considering the special circumstances.

The 19-year-old boy was hospitalised on Wednesday after he consumed poison. The boy, hailing from a village near Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram had donated blood to the Sivakasi blood bank on November 30 without knowing his HIV status. The blood was used for the 23-year-old pregnant woman in the Sattur hospital on December 3 and she got infected.

He was taken to the Ramanathapuram district headquarters hospital, after he was referred from a local hospital. He was later shifted to the GRH. Doctors said he was treated in the intensive care unit, where the best possible treatment was given. Meanwhile, family members of the deceased expressed suspicion over the death. They contended that he was talking normally till the night before and died suddenly after vomiting blood. They submitted a petition to the hospital authorities demanding that the post-mortem be video-taped. They wanted doctors from other hospitals to join the forensic team at the Madurai Medical College.

When meds don’t heal: HIV+ kids fight daily war with side-effects,India News: SOLAPUR: Sumana has the appearance of a 10-year-old though she’s a teenager 11 months shy of 18.,,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"SOLAPUR: Sumana has the appearance of a 10-year-old though shes a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30 kilos, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a kid half her age. She is also hearing impaired. At Solapurs Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtras oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumanas are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, the prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped 54% and new infections 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease like HIV warrants. An otherwise spirited child, Sumant becomes drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. I get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea, he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. The six-year-old is among the 17 children at the Palawi home who have forsaken ART even though their survival depends on it. Born with the virus, these children need to take 2-6 capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Children go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines? We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child, said Palawis 65-year-old founder Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with everyday health problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections like TB. So when medicines meant to heal start giving trouble, they find it easier to discard. Moreover, she adds, institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique problems of each child. Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Palawi was compelled to start its own school in 2014 as children are denied admission in regular ones the moment Palawi is mentioned. But its a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. Palawi, which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease.

Another woman says she got HIV from donor blood,"CHENNAI: Two days after reports about HIV-infected blood being transfused into a pregnant woman, a Chennai-based woman said she too has acquired the v.",Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: Two days after reports about HIV-infected blood being transfused into a pregnant woman, a Chennai-based woman said she too has acquired the viral infection after undergoing treatment at the government-run Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH). The woman, who gave birth to a boy on September 15, told reporters that she tested positive after she was administered two units of blood at the hospital in April. Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P rejected the claim. As per medical records, the woman visited a primary health centre in Mangadu on March 6 when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. In April, doctors referred her to KMCH for blood transfusion after they found her haemoglobin level was low. The report of a blood test she did at a private hospital on February 12 shows HIV negative. At KMCH she was given two units of blood on April 5 and April 6, and she got discharged 10 days later. She was referred back to the hospital in August after scans showed the fetus was in breech position (legs down). Thats when the hospital ordered the HIV test. Usually we assign a number along with every HIV test done. Her records did not have the number. So we repeated the test and she tested positive. We started her on medication and help her deliver a healthy baby in September, said hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P. The woman said she was forced to remain silent as she feared that she would be ostracized by her family and friends. But she petitioned health minister C Vijaya Baskar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and other senior administrators. I did not receive any call from the government. When I read about how another pregnant woman acquired the infection, I decided to talk about my condition, she said. My husband has no infection. This hospital is the only possible source of infection, she said. Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe said the government ordered for an inquiry in December. Today, the inquires revealed said the blood provided by the hospital was tested safe, he said. The two units of blood (1962 and 2129) administered to the woman were labelled safe after they were screened on high-end equipment. While one of the blood samples were sourced from a college student, the other was a regular voluntary blood donor. We have a machine printed copy that says the samples were safe, said Dr Vasanthamani. It is difficult for us to point out the infection source now, she said. Health activists and NGOs say the state health department should do a more detailed inquiry to clear its name. It is important for the hospitals to recall the donors for a HIV test. If they test negative, it is evident that the disease was not transfused through blood. What if the test was false negative because they were in their window period, said Karunanidhi, who works for a positive network NGO. Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director K Senthil Raj said the state has not dropped its guard on blood screening. We have a robost screening programme. At least 60% of deliveries happen in GH. There is no need for women to panic, he said.

Dr R Manoharan, joint director of health services, Virudhunagar, said that on November 30, a relative of a patient at the Sivakasi government hospital had donated blood for the patients requirement. The technicians at the laboratory screened the blood that was donated and labelled it safe. However, since the patients requirement was met from the blood bank, the donated blood was stored. Blatant error from lab employeesOn December 3, this was transfused to an anaemic, pregnant woman .The donor had to go for a blood test at a private laboratory in Virudhunagar as his job appointment abroad required it. The lab report showed him HIV positive and having jaundice. Doubtful of the report, the man approached the Sivakasi government hospital, where a new test confirmed his HIV positive status. Manoharan was informed and there was an immediate search for the donated blood, which they found had been transfused to the pregnant woman. The woman was summoned to the hospital and tests which showed that she had been infected with HIV. It has now come to light that the Sattur government hospital had first found the donor HIV positive in 2016 during a blood donation camp. Instead of conveying it to him directly, he was told he had a rare blood group and was asked to come to the hospital. ""It should no have happened. We have initiated technical inquiries to find out how it happened. This will not be repeated again. We want to ensure this doesn't happen again,"" said Dr K Senthil Raj, project director, Tamil NaduAids Control Society.

Feeling worried about her husbands health condition, she took him to the hospital and made him undergo a medical check-up which revealed that he was infected with HIV. He was infected with HIV for a year but he conveniently covered up the matter for marrying her. But the woman is six months pregnant, the inspector told TOI.

Observing that the premier institution delivered inadequate services thereby causing mental trauma to the complainant, the court ordered that the amount be paid within a month. Naseem Ali, the complainant, who is a resident of Bhagwanpur in Haridwar district, had visited a private hospital in Roorkee for first-aid after suffering an injury on July 12, 2014. There he found that his blood was not clotting properly, following which he was immediately admitted to the hospital. After three days of treatment, he was referred to AIIMS Rishikesh. At AIIMS, tests were conducted and he was told that he was HIV positive. However, when his health deteriorated, his family took him to Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital where he was detected as HIV negative on July 28. In January 2015, Ali registered a complaint with the district consumer forum against Roorkee-based Dr BS Saini Kalawati Hospital, AIIMS Rishikesh and United India Insurance company. Observing carelessness in treatment on part of AIIMS Rishikesh, the consumer forum accepted the case and last month slapped a penalty of Rs 50,000 and an additional Rs 10,000 on the institution for wasting the complainants time and energy. The order, which was issued on April 22, reads, Ensure payment of Rs 50,000 and Rs 10,000 within one month for incorrect treatment. And in case the amount is not paid within a month, then you will be liable to pay this amount at 6% annual interest.

Man attacks niece born with HIV for sleeping in his house,"COIMBATORE: Police have arrested a man for attacking his 19-year-old niece, who was born with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with a wooden log.",,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"COIMBATORE: Police have arrested a man for attacking his 19-year-old niece, who was born with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with a wooden log. The girl, who suffered serious injuries on her head, is undergoing treatment in the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). The 30-year-old man turned violent after seeing the girl in his house at Vellarugampalayam on the outskirts of the city on Thursday, police sources said. The girls mother was HIV-positive and transmitted it to her during pregnancy. She has been undergoing treatment after her birth. Her mother passed away 10 years ago. Her father, a labourer, is living with HIV and taking treatment, a police officer said. The girl often visited her maternal uncles house to meet her grandmother. She was not attending school and used to spend her time with her grandmother. But her uncle did not like her and even warned her against visiting the house.

GMCH gets HIV viral load testing machine,Nagpur: A new viral load testing machine was commissioned at the microbiology department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Monday.,,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"Nagpur: A new viral load testing machine was commissioned at the microbiology department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Monday. This will boost viral load testing for HIV patients in Vidarbha. A team of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) will visit GMCH on Tuesday to complete final testing of this machine. Once installed, this will be a boon for HIV positive patients in Central India as there will be no need for them to travel to Mumbai for viral load test, which measures the amount of HIV in blood. This test is extremely essential to determine the effectiveness of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) of HIV positive patients. According to NACO figures, there are 12 lakh HIV patients on ART of which approximately 30,000 are on second-line treatment and 750 on the third line. Till now, viral load test was available only in 10 centres across the country. These centres were having a heavy load of samples. The only centre in Mumbai at Kasturba Hospital used to get samples from entire Maharashtra, Goa and Gujarat. Due to this, only suspected patients who were not responding to treatment or the ones whose CD4 cell (white blood cells attacked by HIV) count continued to dip were referred for the test. HIV activists and patients were demanding routine viral load testing for all patients. The Centre had sanctioned 80 new viral load testing machines for several government hospitals across the country earlier this year. GMCH, being one of them, has received the machine in April. The calibration has been completed and the machine is most likely to start functioning from April 10.

Activists oppose Johnson & Johnson drug donation,Bedaquiline (BDQ) is one of the latest drugs used to treat drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB).India has the highest burden of drug-resistant TB,Tnn,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: Health activists have written to the Union health ministry pointing out a ""conflict of interest"" created over its acceptance of donations of the drug Bedaquiline from pharma major Johnson & Johnson (J&J) while it faces an inquiry for supplying ""harmful medical devices"" to Indian patients. Bedaquiline (BDQ) is one of the latest drugs used to treat drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB). India has the highest burden of drug-resistant TB and is home to over a quarter of the world's TB patients. ""J&J had previously donated 10,000 courses of BDQ to India's TB programme in 2016, as part of a global donation programme operated in partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID),"" said the letter addressed to minister of state for health, Ashwani Choubey, and to secretary Preeti Sudan. It was signed by NGO All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) as well as several activists working in the field of TB & HIV. Mumbai-based TB activist Ganesh Acharya, who is one of the signatories of the letter, said that the new donation comes three years later in the backdrop of multiple regulatory actions and investigations by the health ministry into harmful medical devices and cosmetic products marketed by J&J in India. The activists believe the donation threatens the sustainability of the government's MDR-TB treatment programme. Moreover, it seems to be aimed at extracting concessions or leniency from the government, added Acharya. The activists said this drug donation would not only create dependence on donations from a single supplier, but also stifle the government's willingness to promote local production of the drug by generic manufacturers to ensure affordable and sustainable supply to the government TB control programme.

"After brief delay, Mysuru gets its quota of anti-HIV drug","Nevirapine syrups and tablets, a key preventive medicine for those afflicted with HIV, is now available in Mysuru. Shortage of the medicine had left p",Tnn,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"MYSURU: Nevirapine syrups and tablets, a key preventive medicine for those afflicted with HIV, is now available in Mysuru. Shortage of the medicine had left pregnant women and new mothers living with HIV, troubled. The city got the first batch of medicines on Wednesday afternoon. The state government had issued a notice saying the drug will not be available until the end of October sending HIV positive mothers into a panic. Nevirapine syrup is given to babies born from HIV positive mothers within 72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of contracting the disease from their mothers. The drug which was available at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers was out of stock. It was not available at private organizations as well. After a 20-day delay, the city on Wednesday received its first consignment of Nevirapine syrups. The essential drug was out of stock since the beginning of September. While NGOs were pulling out all stops to get the drug, new mothers and pregnant women were left wringing their hands and worried sick for their babies. People living with HIV were also deprived of combinations of Nevirapine. Speaking to TOI, district AIDS prevention officer Dr Ravi said taking note of the urgency and complaints from NGOs in the city, the state government dispatched Nevirapine syrups for infants. It is available at the ART centres and new mothers can avail it. Now there is adequate stock to cater to all pregnant and new mothers with HIV. Newborns are our priority, he stated. Chandrashekar, head of the city-based NGO Anandajyothi, said that he had written several mails to the authorities and health officers seeking supply of the essential drug. When NACO replied stating a three-month delay in the supply of Nevirapine, we were shocked. The drug is a necessity for newborns and pregnant women. The drug was available at ART centres but not in medical stores in the city. Since 20 days, people with HIV, parents of newborn would visit hospitals and go back crestfallen. New mothers were worried as it was the question of their childs health. Despite repeated requisitions, the medicine was delayed by 20 days, he added. According to statistics, the city currently has over a dozen HIV positive pregnant women. Nevirapine syrup is said to reduce the chances of a newborn acquiring the virus from the infected mother. It is given to babies within 24 hours of birth up till 45 days. What is Nevirapine? Nevirapine is a prescription medicine for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and children. It is said to prevent postnatal HIV infection. Nevirapine is always used in combination with other HIV medicines. - (By Akshatha J) Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

Every year, World Aids Day on December 1 is marked with awareness programmes across the country but a lot remains to be done for the prevention and control of this deadly disease. The Punjab government should launch an aggressive campaign for educating the sections of society that are most vulnerable to contracting Aids. This includes truck drivers, drug addicts, sex workers, and pregnant women. For the treatment of infected people, integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) need to work in tandem with the health department of the state. The centres should stock necessary medicines for the treatment of this disease. Psychological treatment of the patients is also important and required to be done in a big way.

People show there are no full stops after HIV/AIDS,"NASHIK: Near a decade back, a Nashik couple was looking forward to hearing the “good news” after taking a blood test.",,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"NASHIK: Near a decade back, a Nashik couple was looking forward to hearing the good news after taking a blood test. The results, however, shocked them. The woman was detected with HIV. Later, her husband was also detected with the same condition. The news shattered them and their difficulties seemed to have just begun. But they found a way out and were determined to live life to the fullest. Today, they live in a joint family and are well-known care counsellors in Nashik and Malegaon. Both are trained paraprofessionals and offer a ray of hope to hundreds of others in Nashik district, who were detected with HIV. When we were detected with HIV, we still decided to go ahead with the pregnancy and not to abort our child. We followed entire medical treatment, hoping that our child would be HIV negative. But, when my son was born, he was also detected HIV, she recalled. Her husband had lost his job in a private company. They decided to leave their son with their family and end their lives. Just then, they got in touch with support groups for HIV positive people and found a source of living. We got a work to stitch cloth bags and hand gloves. We started earning a bit. Gradually, we were introduced with the concept of paraprofessionals. As we were educated, we both underwent the training and started working as counsellors. Today, we are leading counsellors in Nashik district, he said. Their families have accepted them whole heartedly and they live in a joint family. We regularly take medicines and live a good life. When we share our story with other HIV+ people, they get inspired, he said. Another couple like them was detected with HIV when they were expecting their first child. Their daughter does not have HIV infection. They have also dedicated their lives for creating awareness about HIV/AIDS. Its the mission of our lives now. God has blessed us with a healthy baby girl and its enough for us. We want her to become a doctor in the future, the man said. This couple works in Nashik city and has successfully convinced many HIV+ patients to get treatment and take their medicines. People can lead a healthy life for a long time with appropriate medical care. Anti-retroviral therapy effectively suppresses replication, if taken at the right time. Positive attitude, hopeand family support play a very important role in fight against AIDS, he said. Both couples work with the Yash Foundation, which offers relief and rehabilitation to HIV/AIDS affected people. We run a paraprofessional course that aims at encouraging youth to participate in tackling various social issues. This programme is implemented in partnership with colleges and includes sensitizing youth on adolescent health and HIV, life skills educations, leadership and personality development, said Ravi Patil, director of Yash Foundation. Awareness on health and HIV remains crucial. There are 108 wards under Nashik Municipal Corporation where we have initiated various community development programmes, he said. Till date, the organization has covered 82 school and colleges and conducted training sessions on HIV/AIDS and social issues. RED Ribbon Clubs for disseminating information on HIV prevention and control have been set up in 17 schools and colleges in Nashik. Yash Foundation has the support of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd under its corporate social responsibility project. They organize state-level marriage gathering to introduce people living with HIV/ AIDS to each other. So far, around 412 eligible brides and grooms have enrolled themselves with the foundation.

Number of HIV cases increasing among young: Expert,"NAGPUR: While incidence of HIV has reduced all over the world, terminally marginalized population remains largely undiagnosed.",,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: While incidence of HIV has reduced all over the world, terminally marginalized population remains largely undiagnosed. This year, theme for World Aids Day is Know Your (HIV) Status. Dr Milind Bhrushundi of Central India Institute of Infectious Diseases and Research Nagpur, said, We are targeting those who have not been tested. Since symptoms of HIV are dormant for over five years, many are not aware if they have HIV, and the only way for them is to get tested. We need to reach out to high risk population  most of whom are homosexuals and transgenders. It is also worrisome to note instances of HIV is increasing in the age group of 15-24 years as people are more concerned about pregnancy than the child. Emergency contraceptive pills and the Internet have proven to be a problem. Also, there have been cases in which people on second line of drugs dont take medications seriously. Alcoholism and drug abuse are significant factors, he added. A 90-90-90 programme by UNAIDS aims that by 2030, there should be a 90% reduction in the number of patients, 90% reduction in new cases and 90% less deaths. Targeted intervention projects to treat those at high risk are need of the hour. Former senior medical officer at ART centre of GMC stated that even today, the same four causes are responsible for HIV patients as those many years ago  unprotected sex and multiple sex partners, parent to child transmission, blood transfusion and unsterilized needles. New technology is not yet available in government hospitals. Since HIV antigen takes about six months to develop, an anti-body test does not identify the antigen. And if the affected person donates blood within those six months, the antigen will be passed to the blood banks, she said, adding that about 20 lakh patients have been taking medicine free of cost at GMC. Earlier, 1000 new cases were identified every month, but they have now reduced to under 100, she added. Positive cases of HIV have reduced due to expansion of our units and increase in awareness. There has been a rise in people taking the test and antenatal check-up as well. We have started mobile vans and even issued bus passes for patients, apart from giving free treatment and drugs, said Tanuja Fale, Programme Manager, District Aids Prevention and Control Unit.

While talking to TOI, Lakhbir said, ""As per the protocol we conduct regular medical tests of all the inmates. At presently, we have 18 HIV +ve cases in our jail and they are receiving proper treatment and diet as per the rules. Also, we do not disclose to other inmates about them, but the patients themselves often voluntarily share their problem with other inmates to build a better understanding during the stay in jail premises. They are always treated well inside the jail and we do not have any complaints from the HIV patients of any harassment or problem while staying here."" ""Earlier the patients from our jail were being treated at Chandigarh, but now with the establishment of FI-ART (Facilitation Integrated Antiretroviral Therapy) Center in Ambala, they will receive the treatment here only,"" said the jail superintendent. Nodal Officer for Ambala FI-ART Center Dr Hitesh said, Most of the positive cases of HIV in Central Jail are the drug abusers who used the affected needles to inject drugs into their bodies, and some of them are due to sexual intercourse. There are two doctors, including myself and consultant Dr Bimal Anand at Ambala FI-ART centre. At present, in Ambala we have 413 registered cases of HIV+ve, out of which 189 are males, 1 is transgender, and 223 females. The actual figure may get double as some of the patients are undergoing treatment from PGI Chandigarh or other hospitals and we are working to identify those cases. As per the guidelines of 2003, earlier the cluster of differentiation (CD4) count was conducted to start the HIV treatment and only those patients were given treatment whose CD4 count was below 200. But now as per the new guidelines of 2018, all the patients, no matter the CD4 count are given treatment,"" said Dr Hitesh. 100 per cent success in treating Mother-Child Transmission cases""As per our records, so far, we have received 16 cases of pregnant mothers who are HIV+ve, and with the prompt identification of the virus and its treatment, we have been successful in failing the transmission of virus from mothers to their children, and all the 16 children have taken birth without any HIV symptoms.

Blood supply takes a hit in Bengal as poll fever hots up,"Lok Sabha Elections 2019 News: KOLKATA: With politicians and party workers busy in election campaigns, the number of blood donation camps has nosedived, leading to a crisis in blood.",,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: With politicians and party workers busy in election campaigns, the number of blood donation camps has nosedived, leading to a crisis in blood banks across Kolkata. Relatives of patients are running from one bank to another for blood units. Authorities of blood banks fear the crisis may deepen as the last phase of polling in the state is still about a month away. My cousin underwent a surgery at Medical College Hospital on Monday. We were told that he would require four units of blood. In anticipation of the crisis, the doctors had alerted us to arrange our own donors before approaching the Central Blood Bank. Luckily, we could arrange for the donors, said Nitish Sahu of Howrah. But the Mondals of Dakshindari were not as lucky as the Sahus. Unaware about the crisis, they went to Central Blood Bank at Maniktala last Thursday for three units of A+ blood for a family member. They could get only one, due to which the surgery had to be deferred for a day at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital. If it was an emergency surgery, we could have faced trouble. Since it was a planned orthopaedic surgery, it could be delayed, said Subhash Mondal, whose uncle underwent the surgery on Friday. A major chunk of supply to the blood banks comes from donation camps organised by local political leaders, which is about 60% of the total pool while the rest comes from camps organised by local clubs and voluntary organisations. Every summer, the number of donation camps dips by about 30%. Now with politicians busy with poll campaigns, the 60% supply from their end is totally off. The supply from local clubs have also halved. Those with negative blood group face a bigger crisis, said D Ashish, secretary Medical Bank, an NGO involved in blood-donation movement. With the supply dropping by almost 80%, even those visiting blood banks with donor cards are finding it increasingly difficult to get blood. Even if one goes to the blood banks with donors after 6pm, they have to wait for the next day since most banks do not have the facility to screen blood for HIV and hepatitis beyond 6pm. Instead of depending on donation camps, we should start looking at facilities of more walk-in donors. In fact, hospitals can start roping in its medical students for such walk-in donations so that there is a steady supply during such period, said Dr Prantar Chakrabarti, hematology head at NRS Medical College and Hospital. Officials of Central Blood Bank, Maniktala said they were able to meet the demand so far. In summer, the gap between supply and demand becomes wider, specially in May, June and July. So far, there is no major crisis. But in anticipation, we have started approaching educational institutes and different offices to organise camps, said Dr Swapan Soren, director at Central Blood Bank, Maniktala. Medical Bank on its part has started putting up banners in prominent locations, asking people to donate blood to tide over the crisis. It would have been of greater help to the public if the government had added private and central blood banks in its app Jibanshakti that provides information only on government-run blood banks, added Ashish.

But now she is in the PGI with a severe neurological complication and is helplessly looking for monetary support. She has been counselling many HIV positives and the irony is that now she is struggling with a disease with hardly anyone to look after her. For her colleagues who had been collecting money for her treatment, she is a face remembered only during the World AIDS Day. But nothing has changed even after she was recognized for her relentless work. With lot of difficulty, we could collect Rs 12,000 for a test in the PGI for Pooja. We had also approached the project director of State Aids Control Society (SACS), but in vain, said Meena Vij, working with the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV AIDS. At a young age of 21 years, Pooja lost her husband to AIDS. Not only that, she was also infected and cast away from her family for the same. In the absence of anyone she left her hometown in Himachal and since 2007 has been working at the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV AIDS. I have three sons and after my admission in the PGI, I do not know how they are managing. I am in the hospital since the last three months. My brother and a friend helped me to get the tests done. But no one from the SACS came to even see me here, said Pooja. She has been a recipient of the state award in 2010. The same year, Pooja tossed the coin for Bollywood actress Preity Zinta co-owned team Kings XI Punjab in their opening match in the third Indian Premier League at PCA stadium in Mohali. Right from counselling single women both infected and affected by the HIV, Pooja and her team members have been raising voices for the lack of funds and medicines for the antiretroviral drugs, required for the HIV treatment. Denying that no help has been rendered by SACS, Dr Vanita Gupta, project director said, There is no provision under the SACS which allows financial help in such cases. However, I have tried to help whatever was within my capacity. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

Steep increase in HIV/AIDS infection among Tamil Nadu youth,"As the government prepares to observe International Day for AIDS on Saturday, the state is witnessing a steep increase in new HIV/AIDS infection among",,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: As the government prepares to observe International Day for AIDS on Saturday, the state is witnessing a steep increase in new HIV/AIDS infection among youngsters despite an overall fall in new cases. Public health experts suspect unprotected sex and exchanging of needles in the 10-25 age group in the state to be the major reasons behind the spurt. While increase in cases has also been seen among the elderly, there is a drastic decline among other age groups. Tho ugh the incidence of the infection in TN, which recorded 43% of all cases in the country in 2003, has come down to less than 10% this year, it has gone up from 160 in 2015-16 to 187 in 2017-18 in the 10-19 age group. At least 99 people in the age group have tested positive between April and October this year. In the 20-25 age group, the number of cases has gone up from 432 in 2015 to 554 in 2017-18. At least 318 cases have been recorded between April and October this year. In the 60 and above age group, the numbers went up to 699 in 2017-18 from 536 cases in 2015-16. This year, 435 cases have been recorded between April and October. Use social media for HIV awareness Project director, Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society, K Senthil Raj, said, There are a lot of dating apps and social media websites that encourage youngsters to get into active sex life. Older methods of attracting target audience such as sex workers and truckers will not work with them. While it is important to keep a tab on conventional spots, it is equally important to use social media and dating apps to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. While several surveys, including those carried out by the union health ministry, have recorded significant drop in awareness about HIV/AIDS in the state, funding from the Centre, state and external agencies to AIDS control society too have fallen. This year of the 69 crore outlay, 55 crore went towards salaries. Most of our staff have been working here for more than 15 years and the salaries have substantially increased. In addition, 13 crore was given to NGOs for various programmes, said a senior officer at TANSACS. The number of people testing positive at the voluntary testing and counselling centres have dropped to mere 30%. This means a majority of people are being tested positive at the tertiary care centres where they go with complaints of other diseases or complications of HIV. This also means they are not diagnosed early, said R Madhuri, a psychologist who has been working in capacity building projects with NGOs. It means the battle against AIDS is far from over, she said. We are doing all that we can to grab the attention of youth, said Senthil Raj. This year, the society has organised a meme contest to create awareness on the infection. The state had received over 1,000 memes, mostly from people below the age of 30 years.

Viruses ‘hack’ molecular biological system,AHMEDABAD: Viruses such as HIV — responsible for AIDS — are difficult to deal with.,,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Viruses such as HIV  responsible for AIDS  are difficult to deal with. How they enter human cells and how they multiply and manipulate the human immune system have been studied over the years to find a cure. A new research published in journal 'Scientific Reports' by the Nature Research points at a mathematical model of the spread where the viruses target the nodes for maximum control of the signalling network in human cells. The paper, Network controllability analysis of intracellular signalling reveals viruses are actively controlling molecular systems, was recently published in Nature. A senior research fellow at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT), Dr Vandana RaviA new research published in journal 'Scientific Reports' by the Nature Research points at a mathematical model of the spread where the viruses target the nodes for maximum control of the signalling network in human cells.ndran, was one of the lead authors. Other team members included Prof V Sunitha from DAIICT and researchers from Toho University in Japan, University of Glasgow, and University of Manchester in the UK, and IIIT-Delhi. Human cell is a complex organism. When it interacts with viruses  which cant live on their own, changes happen at both the sides, said Ravindran. The viruses try to hijack the entire system, but how does that happen? Viruses choose the driver nodes in our molecular systems to gain access to the complex network. The principle is known as control theory in data sciences. The process can be compared to how hackers identify a central computer system and attack it to gain access to a large network of computers to infect it. The team studied the pattern in both HIV and Hepatitis C viruses by carrying out experiments in both infected and normal systems. The research gives us a peek into the complex system through which the viruses interact with human proteins and the dynamics governing the spread and intensity, said Ravindran. Application of this computational biology can be found in drug delivery system and identifying anti-viral targets. Ravindran is currently a research fellow at The Royal Society as part of two-year Newton International Fellowship under which she got a grant of GBP 91,192 (approximately Rs 82.23 lakh) for her post-doctoral research, Modelling viral-host molecular interaction using control theory. The paper argues that a virus efficiently brings the dynamically organized host system into its control by mostly targeting existing critical control nodes, requiring fewer nodes than in the uninfected network. The lower number of control nodes is presumably to optimize exploitation of the sub-system required for virus replication and host response to infection.

The team was lead by Dr Gaurav Gaur, assistant professor, Centre for Social Work, Panjab University. All these children have contracted HIV/AIDS from their parents. Some of them have even lost their fathers to HIV and now are being brought up by their mothers alone. Despite all odds, these great mothers  who are simultaneously facing stigma and discrimination from their families and outsiders too  are fending for their children and working hard for their education, even with little or no recurring financial support, said Gaur. Sharing the experience, NSS volunteer Ishita Choudhary said these children were provided with stationary items like registers, copies, pens, bags, pencils and colour boxes etc. to encourage them to do better. They were also given health kits which included toothbrush, toothpaste, soap cakes and healthy refreshments. She said it was a learning experience and the small gesture brought smiles on the childrens faces. The parents and guardians were also given household items and ration. Gaur said all the items given to these children or to their parents and guardians were donated by various philanthropists. The children had come from over nine different villages near Anandpur Sahib, some of which also fall in the state of Himachal Pradesh.

‘Rising CO2 levels leading to zinc deficiency in diet’,India News: NEW DELHI: Rising carbon dioxide levels in the air is causing zinc deficiency in Indian crops thus impacting nutritional value of food consumed by hum.,,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Rising carbon dioxide levels in the air is causing zinc deficiency in Indian crops thus impacting nutritional value of food consumed by humans. The national rates of inadequate zinc intake has increased from 17% to 25% between 1983 and 2012 increasing risk of diseases like malaria, diarrhoeal afflictions and pneumonia, particularly in children, a new study by the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health says. Apart from rising CO2 emissions, changing diets and an aging population are also seen as factors responsible for increasing zinc deficiency. The study shows highest rates of inadequate intake are concentrated mainly in southern and north-eastern states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya where diets are more rice-dominated. Rice is poor in zinc, aggravating zinc inadequacy in diets of people who rely heavily upon it. Rising CO2 levels in the coming decades could accelerate this trend. National grain fortification programmes, increased dietary diversity, biofortified crops, and reduced CO2 emissions could all make a difference to slow or reverse the course, the observations made on the study said. The presence of zinc plays a critical role in human immune systems and lack of it increases vulnerability to illnesses listed by the study. Findings of the study show urban populations overall, and wealthier urban groups in particular, also have higher rates of inadequate zinc intake due to a higher proportion of calorie-rich and nutrient-poor fats and sugars in their diet. Indian diets have been evolving, losing coarse grains such as millet and sorghum and adding wheat, animal products, fruits and vegetables. In total, these changes have offset each other to keep the average per-person intake remarkably constant. However, the aging of the population has caused the zinc requirement for the average Indian to increase by 5%, because adults need more zinc than children. Many individual or governmental actions have the potential to reverse this course: national-level grain fortification programmes, encouraging dietary diversity toward richer sources of zinc or biofortifying major crops by choosing or creating plant varieties with higher zinc content than currently available. Finally, addressing rising global CO2 levels through ongoing and sustained efforts could help to avert future deepening of this unresolved public health issue, the study said.

Transplants are risky too — the Texas boy died after one.Doctors think gene therapy could be a solution.

Cops to check fitness of buses taking students on school picnic,SURAT: Regional Transport Office (RTO) and police will check the reliability and quality of buses before they are allowed to take school students on t.,Tnn,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"SURAT: Regional Transport Office (RTO) and police will check the reliability and quality of buses before they are allowed to take school students on tours. Police on Monday said old buses will not be allowed and its latest notification in this regard was applicable in the districts of Tapi, Dang, Navsari and Valsad. The fitness of the bus needs to be checked thoroughly before the students are allowed to travel in it. The fitness of the vehicle will be conducted by the RTO, the notification says. A month ago, owner of a tuition class took students, teachers and some parents on a tour to Dang-Saputara where the bus carrying them fell in a gorge killing 10 people, including two teachers. Police want to avert such accidents and ensure maximum safety of students. Rajkumar Pandian, Surat range inspector general of police, said, There have been a couple of accidents here in which school students were victims. Investigations found that their vehicles were unfit for travel. The drivers too were new and not aware about the slopes and turns etc on the route. This is why we have issued the notification. A school or an educational institution intending to take students on a tour by road transport will have to contact nearby police station. The bus fitness will be checked by the cops with the help of RTO officials. The qualification of drivers will also be checked before permission is given for travel.

Many essential drugs priced much higher than manufacturing cost: WHO,"India News: NEW DELHI: Around 40% of the essential medicines in India with lowest MRP are priced significantly higher than estimated production costs, an assessme.",,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Around 40% of the essential medicines in India with lowest MRP are priced significantly higher than estimated production costs, an assessment by the World Health Organisation (WHO) shows highlighting the exorbitant profiteering by pharmaceutical companies and the scope for lowering prices of drugs. While innovative and newer drugs for cancer, hepatitis C and rare diseases are out of reach of many due to their unaffordable prices, even off patent drugs which are in market for long and commonly used for diseases like HIV, tuberculosis and malaria are priced very high with huge margins over their cost of production. This results in high expenditure pushing people into poverty. In India over 75% of health expenditure is out-of-pocket, of which the major chunk is spent on medicines. This is despite India being a manufacturing hub and the biggest supplier of low cost generic medicines to the world. The study shows while Indian prices were below WHOs estimated generic pri- ce in many cases, they were mostly government tender prices, which are likely to be significantly lower than the private market prices more often experienced by those needing medicines in India. Moreover, most of the high-priced medicines in India were found only in the private market, suggesting a lack of availability in public facilities, the study said. Findings of the report were discussed by the global health community at an international forum hosted by the UN agency on fair pricing and access to medicines last week in Johannesburg. Delegates from governments and civil society organisations called for greater transparency around the cost of research and development as well as production of medicines, to allow buyers to negotiate more affordable prices. The market prices of medicines in India do not bear any resemblance to the cost of production. Unfortunately, the national pricing regulation, applied to essential medicines, has shifted from a cost-plus mechanism to a market-based mechanism in 2013. This has been challenged by AIDAN in the Supreme Court because the market-based system is deeply flawed, says Malini Aisola of All India Drugs Action Network (AIDAN) Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

"Took to crime to fund treatment, claims snatcher",NOIDA: A man arrested for snatching mobile phones has told police he took to crime to fund his treatment for HIV in a private hospital.,Tnn,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"NOIDA: A man arrested for snatching mobile phones has told police he took to crime to fund his treatment for HIV in a private hospital. The accused, from Bulandshahr, had been snatching phones in Kasna and Knowledge Park areas along with an accomplice for the past few days. A father of two children, the man claimed he came to know that he was HIV-positive three months ago but didnt inform his family. He was arrested from Kasna on Sunday evening along with an accomplice, Manoj Kumar. At least seven phones and a bike used in committing the crimes were recovered from them. Manoj told a news conference he was unaware of his associates ailment and it was, in fact, the latter who had inducted him into crime. He is a painter by profession and so is Manoj. We are not going into the depths of his claim as most accused try such tactics to claim innocence. We have produced them in court. Jail authorities can get his medical tests done and verify the claim, said Ajay Kumar, the SHO of Kasna police station. The accused has even given the name of a private hospital where, he claimed, he had been undergoing treatment. He told police he wasnt a hardened criminal but had started snatching phones only 15 days ago. They had been moving around on a bike without changing its number plate. In fact, the number plate was reversed so that the registration number is not visible to anyone, the officer said. A spokesperson for the private hospital said the claims could be verified by the medical records department. We have not been contacted yet, he said.

Not approaching politics as a star: Urmila Matondkar,"Lok Sabha Elections 2019 News: Urmila Matondkar, the star of 90s hit Hindi films like ""Rangeela"", ""Daud"" and ""Judaai"", is contesting the Lok Sabha elections but says she isn't appro",Pti,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: Urmila Matondkar, the star of 90s hit Hindi films like ""Rangeela"", ""Daud"" and ""Judaai"", is contesting the Lok Sabha elections but says she isn't approaching politics as a star and would rather be known as people's representative. ""I am not approaching this whole thing as a star with my star image. I am trying to get to grassroot and connect to people. I know it is going to be difficult."" ""I want to generate confidence in them about me as their representative more than just another star coming in, waving and asking for votes. Because that is not the thought with which I have gotten into it,"" Urmila told PTI in an interview. Considering she is a known face, ask her if Bollywood celebrities can be vote pullers, pat comes the reply, ""I can't talk about others, it is not fair. Media generally likes to generalise things as it makes their life easy."" She will be contesting the election from Mumbai North constituency, a seat held by Govinda. Urmila, who has been campaigning and meeting the locals, says some of the major issues of the area are housing, water scarcity and sanitation. ""The most important issue is housing and it is too deep rooted for anyone to get a solution quickly. The slum redevelopment needs to be looked into. Water is another big issue, it is also deep rooted so overnight solution is not possible. Women's health, local trains. But we need do to things."" ""This area is issue-ridden probably the most in Mumbai. People have been telling me about need for public toilets, water in Gorai area is another problem. Also (need for more) local trains as the population is more here and there is no infrastructure."" She is fighting against BJP's Gopal Shetty, a seasoned politician who has called Urmila naive and zero in politics. But the actor isn't affected. ""That shows his mentality in the whole thing. He started saying that this is going to be a battle of vichardhara (ideology) but non-stop he is speaking derogatory things about me, which I have never done.I think there can be two things behind it - someone who is not very confident and all these things stem out of deep rooted fear that must have come in."" The actor said the kind of politics he and his party indulge in focuses more on ""emotional battles"", keeping people occupied with ""all kinds of emotional, religious and socio-economic issues."" ""So that they do not come to main issues like what is progress? And where is the progress? ""If that is the politics he is referring to, I am happy to be political zero. For me politics is giving your word, standing by it and abiding by it no matter what."" The 45-year-old actor, who was last seen in a special appearance in Irrfan Khan's ""Blackmail"", felt it was time for her to do something for the society. ""I was against contesting the elections. I was interested in joining another party and wanted to campaign for whoever they wanted me to. They were interested that I contest the election and when you join a party you go with the decision the party makes and stand by it and give it your best."" According to Urmila, the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is going to be a ""very deciding election for the country"". Since her childhood, the actor says she was socially responsible and has been working towards issues related to women, children's education, AIDS awareness among others. Talking about Rahul Gandh as a Prime Ministerial candidate, Urmila believes he will be a ""phenomenal"" Prime Minister. ""He is a person, who is constantly trolled and degraded for the last five years but has worked non-stop without stooping to any such levels that the opposition constantly has like trolling and criticising on wrong issues. ""He has gone to grassroot level tried to understand the problem of people. The outcome of all that is the Congress manifesto, which is remarkable achievement."" She further says Gandhi has utilised the time to build the party and take the nation somewhere up without being in power. ""If he comes in power he will be capable of delivering it well,"" she adds. There have been celebrities who are dabbling into both, politics and acting, but Urmila intends to focus only on her political career at the moment. ""As of now I don't see any film thing happening. This is something so huge and challenging. It has been extremely challenging because I was prepared coming from a line of film industry to be criticised and not given your due or to be looked down up but to be ridiculed and trolled completely that all is a lot and that is a separate thing. ""It is a huge challenging career so I think it is already taking lot of time. I don't see the film bit happening."" Ask her about the issues faced by the industry and Urmila says, their issues are ""same as that of normal people."" ""The fact that our freedom of speech or freedom of any sort has come under tremendous danger. Here is the issue that everybody is facing be it media or film industry or common man.""

"Aurangabad woman claims she is HIV+, staves off rape",AURANGABAD: A murder accused out on bail tried to rape a 29-year-old widow near a nullah at Rajnagar but she thwarted the attempt by claiming to be HI.,Tnn,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"AURANGABAD: A murder accused out on bail tried to rape a 29-year-old widow near a nullah at Rajnagar but she thwarted the attempt by claiming to be HIV positive. Fearing he would be infected, the man left the place but was arrested by the police a couple of days ago. The man, Kishore Vilas Avhad (22), a resident of Rajnagar in the Mukundwadi area, had been arrested earlier for murdering his father. On the night of March 25, the woman, a resident of MIDC Waluj, had come to the city to shop with her seven-year-old daughter. While wanting to return home, she realised that she had only Rs 10 with her. She tried in vain to get seat-sharing autorickshaws to drop her and her daughter. She then stood outside the Shahnoormiya dargah asking for a lift. Avhad, who happened to be passing by on his motorcycle, offered to drop the woman and her daughter home. However, he rode to the nullah at Rajnagar instead. He threatened the woman with a sharp weapon and attempted to rape her. However, the woman showed great presence of mind by claiming to be HIV positive, following which Avhad left the spot. Assistant inspector Shraddha Waydande said the woman contacted the police and an offence for kidnapping and molestation was registered against Avhad, who had not been identified till then. The police also slapped sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against him. Waydande said that based on the information provided by the woman, a sketch of the accused was prepared. The woman also told the police about the marks and tattoos on the accuseds hand. Using the description, we managed to arrest Avhad a couple of days ago, she said.

HIV patient claims Bengaluru hospital denied treatment,BENGALURU : A 47-year-old HIV positive man from Chintamani in Chikkaballapur district was allegedly denied treatment by the governmentrun Institute of.,,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"BENGALURU : A 47-year-old HIV positive man from Chintamani in Chikkaballapur district was allegedly denied treatment by the governmentrun Institute of Nephro Urology (INU) in Victoria Hospital campus. However, the hospital has dismissed allegations of discrimination. For the past three years, the man has been undergoing treatment in Bengaluru to avoid the stigma he might face in his native town. Earlier this year, he was diagnosed with renal failure and was put on dialysis at INU in May 2018. However in July, he was told to seek treatment at his native place or in any other hospital. He was a construction labourer and as hes suffering from tuberculosis and kidney disorder, hes unable to work now. His homemaker wife is also an HIV patient. Their only son is pursuing graduation in Chintamani. His wife told STOI theyre facing discrimination everywhere. I approached the government hospital in Chintamani also, but considering his HIV status, they said as its a high-risk case he needed a separate machine for dialysis However, doctors claimed all patients who come to INU are initially treated here as its a peripheral centre. Later, they are advised to go back to their native places for further treatment as these facilities are available in all districts now. Its not a case of discrimination. I will look into the issue, said institute director Dr Shivalingaiah. He said over 80 patients undergo dialysis every day and had to be taken to INU only. We went to INU last week, but the hospital is not treating him, she alleged. She said from May to July, he was put on dialysis thrice a week. But it stopped since July. When his condition worsened a week ago, INU refused treatment. The family tried its luck with other government hospitals in Bengaluru, but was turned away on the grounds that he required a special machine for dialysis.

Viral load testing to treat people living with HIV soon,"JAIPUR: Forty one thousand people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are taking daily antiretroviral (ARV) drugs from 24 centres in the state, will get the f.",,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"JAIPUR: Forty one thousand people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are taking daily antiretroviral (ARV) drugs from 24 centres in the state, will get the facilities for viral load testing in the state soon, as National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has set up viral load testing machines in three hospitals attached to government-run medical colleges. The machines have been installed in Jaipurs Sawai Man Singh medical college and hospital, Udaipurs RNT medical college and hospital and Jodhpurs SN medical college and hospital. But, it is expected to become functional from July as NACO is yet to send testing kits. Each machine costs approximately Rs1 crore. According to Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) officials, the new machines will help doctors in deciding the line of treatment for PLHIVs. Earlier, we were sending blood samples for viral load testing to a private laboratory in Mumbai as NACO has an MoU with them. But, it has a limitation. We are allowed to get 20 samples tested in one week but we have 41,000 patients who are on ART (antiretroviral therapy), said an RSACS official. He said that with new machines have been installed in the state, the test will be done here which will benefit all PLHIVs on ARTs. Earlier, doctors were providing the treatment on the basis of a test, knowing as cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cells. The test provides details to the doctors that how much cells which contributes to immunity fighting against opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis. CD4 cells are sometimes called T-helper cells which are essential part of the human immune system. The HIV is the virus which destroy T-helper cells (CD4 cells). At present we have facilities for CD4 at all 24 ART centres across the state through which we provide treatment to PLHIVs on the basis of number of CD4 cells, said the official adding that viral load testing and CD4 test are completely different. CD4 helps in ascertaining immunity systems conditions, but viral load testing helps in ascertaining the number of viruses (HIV) in the blood. Viral load testing is helpful in treatment as it helps doctors in monitoring the number of viruses (HIV) and also deciding the line of treatment, he said. We have three lines of treatment in ART centres. We give first line of ART to PLHIVs until it keeps increasing the number of CD4 cells. When first line of ART fails to increase CD4 cells, we give second line of ART and when second line of ART fails to increase number of CD4, we give them third line of ART. Through CD4 we cannot monitor viral load, if viruses are increasing in veins. For that purpose, we require viral load testing facility. Now we are strengthening viral load testing facility in the state with three machines, which will also decide line of treatment (ART), said the official. The officials said that ART is not a cure but through ART, the lifespan of PLHIV can be increased, which depends on the health conditions of the PLHIVs.

HIV+ man cleared of killing son he thought was infected too,"A 51-year-old HIV-positive man was recently acquitted of murdering his minor son in 2016 after his wife, the complainant in the case, turned hostile.",,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: A 51-year-old HIV-positive man was recently acquitted of murdering his minor son in 2016 after his wife, the complainant in the case, turned hostile. Police alleged that the accused killed the child after suspecting that he too was HIV positive like his wife, daughter and himself. The woman denied telling the cops earlier that her husband had called her up after disappearing with their son and said that he had killed him. The child was found drowned in a nullah along the railway tracks. Observing that the homicidal death of the child was not proved, the sessions court also did not find the alleged motive convincing. ""It is not believable that when his wife and daughter are suffering from HIV and they were taking treatment at a civil hospital in Jalna, then merely on suspicion that the deceased might be suffering from HIV, he would take such a drastic step of taking the life of his son,"" the court said. The accused and his wife had six children. The accused had been in jail from July 11, 2016. The prosecution stated that on July 5, 2016, the son was crying so the accused took him out. The prosecution said after there no trace of the father and the son, the woman appproached the police at 4am the next day, and later the accused called her on her phone and said he had killed their son. Pointing to her statement during the trial, the court said her evidence showed that her son was missing, so her husband went to search him.

The hospital officials said antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug nevirapine  given to prevent HIV transmission  would be given for the baby, apart from an antibiotic everyday as a form of continued treatment. The woman has also been asked to take two medicines everyday. Both are fine now, but we have asked them to come for a review in about a week, GRH dean Dr K Vanitha said. Though offered a job at DAPCU, the woman had initially refused a society-based job and sought a permanent job. Officials from the health department said all steps were being taken to fulfil her wish. A permanent government job would be offered to her very soon and in the meantime, for her livelihood support we have offered her the job at DAPCU based on her qualification, project director of Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society K Senthil Raj said.

Over 100 HIV patients brought back to ART,"Kolhapur: Over 100 HIV patients in the city and the district have been brought back to the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), officials from the District A.",Updated,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"Kolhapur: Over 100 HIV patients in the city and the district have been brought back to the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), officials from the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) said. After an awareness campaign was conducted in the district, it was found that about 600 patients who were earlier treated under ART had opted out. Many were traced and offered counselling, and several are not opting to return to treatment. Officials said ART is absolutely necessary for those testing positive for HIV. It offers resistance against infection. However, the absolute necessity of the treatment is often not entirely understood by those most in need of it. Asked why patients might be opting out, the official said one reason could be the sheer strain of finances. There are also side-effects of ART when treatment first begins. Patients might find it a drain on their resources to just arrive at the hospital, especially if their homes are in rural areas. People also do not like to disclose their HIV-positive status, and getting regular treatment puts them at the risk of getting found out as being HIV-positive. Four hospitals in the district are equipped to offer ART. A city-based private hospital too has been included for such treatment, so there are in all five centres in the district offering this treatment. Patients are counselled at integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) before being put on treatment. After performing different blood tests, a patient whose CD4 count is less than 500 has to take treatment throughout his life. That norm, however, has now been relaxed. CD4 count is an indicator of how well the bodys immune system is working.Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer at DAPCU, said that as part of the awareness campaign, slum areas in the city are monitored and patients screening conducted.Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

According to district TB officer Dr Vijay Chhajlani, around 20 doctors have been issued showcause notices after it was found that they have not reported details of TB patients that they have treated. He added that last year after department roped in chemists in the mission, officials were able to identify doctors, who have not provided patient details to the department as chemists are liable to send officials details of medicines and prescriptions. Dr Chhajlani said if doctors do not provide details they can be sent to jail for six months according to the rule. However, no such action has been taken till now. He claimed that in last one year, it has been noticed that MDR TB cases have increased. Of the total tuberculosis patients detected across the district, around two per cent are multi-drug resistant cases. He added, We are still unable to identify all TB patients. For this, department has planned to start an extensive survey in urban and rural areas through which each house will be surveyed and a primary test will be conducted to identify tuberculosis patients in Indore district. While talking to TOI, Dr Chhajlani said, The health department has now also started providing bedaquiline medicine for which total treatment pack cost around Rs 13 lakh.

"HIV+ woman denied surgery at Kolkata hospital, says son",KOLKATA: The son of an HIV-positive patient has alleged denial of medical care by state-run NRS Medical College and Hospital (NRSMCH).,Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: The son of an HIV-positive patient has alleged denial of medical care by state-run NRS Medical College and Hospital (NRSMCH). The 63-yearold woman was admitted to the hospital with a fractured femur, for which she needs to undergo surgery. While the son claimed doctors had suspended treatment after learning that she was HIV positive, hospital authorities denied the charge and said the treatment had got prolonged due to other health issues of the woman. The patient, a Beliaghata resident, was admitted to Unit-V of the orthopaedic surgery department on October 5 after she fell down at her home. All investigations prior to the surgery were done. But the doctors stopped her treatment after they came to know about her HIV status. They do not want to take up the surgery, alleged one of her sons. The hospital refuted the allegations and said the patient was being tended to with conservative treatment. According to the doctors, the patient needs hip replacement surgery that must be done under anesthesia. But the patient has other health issues, including chest ailment and psychiatric problems. We have to wait for anaesthesia clearance due to these conditions, a doctor said. The allegations are baseless. We conduct surgeries on HIV-positive patients on regular basis. So why we would we deny medical care to this particular patient. The reasons for the delay in the surgery are technical and has nothing to do with her being HIV positive, said Dr Dwipayan Biswas, deputy medical superintendent at NRSMCH. The patients family had lodged a formal complaint on October 12 with the hospital authority. The hospital administration claimed that the family was explained about the delay in taking up the surgery. My mother is lying on a hospital bed without any treatment. Doctors have told us to take her back home after they came to know that she is HIV status positive, alleged her elder son.

Speaking to TOI, HSP Pune superintendent of police Milind Mohite said, There are several potholes on the road and vehicles change their course of direction at high speed, which is risky. According to HSP officials, the potholes have surfaced on expressway, especially between Urse Toll plaza and Lonavla section. They have come up in the last few months on both Mumbai and Pune corridors. According to police, motorists, especially car drivers, want to avoid potholes. It is risky to change the course of journey to avert potholes, but drivers often change course of journey or switch lanes, he said. We have requested the concerned officials to repair the road surface to avert any untoward incident on expressway, he said. A senior MSRDC officer told TOI, We have asked the maintenance agency to repair the road surface. Actually, the agency should not wait for our orders.

The officer said that MSRDC officials have observed that there are fissures on the concrete surface and the agency has filled it with tar.

During the previous hearing, a division bench of justice N Kirubakaran and justice S S Sundar observed that the husband needed counselling. The judges had also stated that as the victims husband was not taking care of her and is not showing interest to live with her, it is appropriate for the state government to provide a house, a permanent government job for her educational qualification, continue the medical facilities till her life time and compensation for the mental agony, pain, suffering in a fixed deposit for her to withdraw the interest. The judges further stated that till a job is provided for the victim, she should be given money every month along with the required medicines.

Sonagachhi survey gives hope in fight against AIDS,KOLKATA: A study conducted among female sex workers at Sonagachhi by Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) has shown positive results in terms of a.,,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: A study conducted among female sex workers at Sonagachhi by Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) has shown positive results in terms of achieving the global target of zero AIDS-related deaths by 2030. National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has already decided to integrate the daily use of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a relatively new HIV prevention strategy that involves use of antiretroviral medications (ARVs), based on DMSC survey. It will help assess the impact and feasibility of the daily use of oral PrEPs. The project started in 2016 was supported by World Health Organizations Geneva office. About 678 sex workers were given PrEPs daily for a period of 16 months and during the course of the demonstration project, not a single case of sero-conversion (the period of time during which HIV antibodies develop and become detectable) was detected among the participants who received PrEP. The objective of this strategy is to strengthen the HIV intervention programme and is not intended to replace the existing HIV prevention strategies. It is rather meant to be used in combination with other preventive measures so that it can help the sex workers, who are unable or unwilling to correctly and consistently use condoms, said chief adviser of DMSC Smarajit Jana. They were selected after preliminary blood tests revealed they were not HIV- positive. The entire process was carried out through peer educators with an objective to find out sex workers interest and level of acceptance of oral PrEP. Other important factors, like pregnancy, Hepatitis B, high level of bilirubin were kept in mind while screening the sex workers for this study. PrEP will empower us and provide a sense of freedom and confidence, said a sex worker at Sonagachhi.

People with HIV speak out against discrimination,"PANAJI: Despite legislations and ample awareness about HIV/AIDs, people living with the disease continue to be stigmatised.",Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Despite legislations and ample awareness about HIV/AIDs, people living with the disease continue to be stigmatised. Similarly, transgenders face the highest level of discrimination. These were some of the issues discussed at a forum held in the city on Friday to mark Zero Discrimination Day. An initiative of NGO Human Touch Foundation the forum had seven speakers. People living with HIV (PLHIV) activist Celina DCosta, who discovered her HIV status shortly after her husband was detected with the disease, said she was thrown out of her husbands house. Her husband had died within three months of his status becoming clear. My mother-in-law locked toilets in the house as she and others feared they would get the disease if they shared the toilet with me. They didnt want me to be in the same house as they believed mosquito bites could also be a source of infection. 20 years later, she said, she is in a better placed and that level of discrimination doesnt exist any more, though it still exists. If there was zero discrimination, people would not have hesitated to reveal their HIV/AIDS status, she said Monika Shatriya, disability and gender rights activists, spoke about how transgenders are subjected to inhuman treatment. She said the legislation for transgenders is a half-hearted attempt. The proposed provision in the legislation for setting up a committee to certify the status of a transgender is not right, she said. Lawyer and human rights activist Adv Albertina Almeida said some of the legislations introduced to remove discrimination are yet to be implemented. Administrator at Fr Agnel College Fr Allan Tavares, talking about discrimination against transgenders, said Who are we to think they are abnormal and we are normal.

The CMO also about 40 to 50 women inmates were also screened during the camp and found to be free from any ailments. He said 300 inmates were yet to be examined by the health department. He said the HIV positive inmates would have to get their treatment card made from PGIMS, Rohtak, while the district health department would start their treatment in the jail. Earlier, the HIV positive patients had to go to the antiretroviral (ART) centre in the PGIMS for treatment but now the district health team started providing the facility to them in Jind. Our unit is now linked with the ART centre of the PGIMS, Dr Dahiya said. He said the department was concerned about the health of jail inmates and would continue conducting such checkups in future.

Jind jail superintendent Harinder Singh said they used to organize such health check-up camps earlier as well. Those who were found to be HIV positive were lodged in the jail only recently.

A top official from the state health department confirmed the test result to TOI. We generally do testing for HIV six weeks after a baby is born. Similar process was carried out for this girl too and the test results were negative for HIV infection, the official said. The test result was declared a few days back. The baby was born at the Government Rajaji Hospital on January 17, and on March 4  when the girl turned 46-days-old  her blood sample was sent to a medical research centre in Chennai to test for HIV infection. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which according to the experts is very accurate, was performed. Officials said that the test would be conducted again when the girl is six-months-old and one-and-a-half-years old. When contacted, the babys father said that he was extremely relieved. Though Im still distressed about what happened with my wife and concerned about her future, Im relieved that my daughter tested negative for HIV infection. I hope further tests will show the same result, he said.

The Joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response. Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017. The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines. In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said. India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said. Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said. The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work. It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work. Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade. The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids. Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said. Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments. UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point. At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition. ""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,"" Sidibe said. Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted. Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020. In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said. The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming. Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs. ""The right to health for all is non-negotiable,"" said Sidibe. ""Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,"" Sidibe added.

"HIV case: Coimbatore hospital checks files, records","On Wednesday, doctors said the girl child, who weighed 700 grams at birth, has had several hospital admissions due to complications from congenital he",Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"COIMBATORE: Two days after a two-year-old child tested positive for HIV, doctors at the Coimbatore Medical College hospital are poring over case records, hospital data and doing intensive medical checks to find out the source of infection. The child's parents and twin have tested negative for HIV. Meanwhile, Coimbatore collector K Rajamani has ordered an independent inquiry, which is likely to run parallelly. On Wednesday, doctors said the girl child, who weighed 700 grams at birth, has had several hospital admissions due to complications from congenital heart diseases such as a hole in the heart. Preliminary inquiries revealed that she had spent more than five weeks in neo-natal care at the KAP Viswanathan Government Medical College in Tiruchi soon after birth. She was admitted to the Coimbatore government hospital with complications of heart disease twice in the past one year. ""Once we gave her blood transfusion but it was issued only after we tested it for the infection. It was clean. We are pulling out all case sheets, records of hospital or clinic visits,"" said hospital dean Dr B Ashokan. After seeing an injury mark on the head, the hospital had also asked the child's parents more about the barber who tonsured the child's head. HIV is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk from an infected person either through unsterilized medical equipment such as syringes or catheters, or blood from an infected person or through unsafe sex. Hospital blood bank officer Dr A Mangayarkarasi said the department has submitted ELISA reports that confirm the blood transfused to this child was safe.

HC seeks response from state government on funds allotted to AIDS control society,MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has sought response from the state regarding the funds allotted to Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control S.,Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has sought response from the state regarding the funds allotted to Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (Tansacs) during the past 10 years. When a batch of petitions related to the recent HIV blood transfusion case in Virudhunagr was taken up for hearing on Wednesday, a counsel who appeared for one of the petitioners stated that people who do not have proper qualification are involved in handling blood tests under Tansacs across the state. He said that qualified people should be appointed in order to ensure safe collection and transfusion of blood. The counsel further noted that the funds which has been allotted for Tansacs have not been audited for the past several years. =Perusing the submissions, a division bench of justice N Kirubakaran and justice S S Sundar sought a response from the state government regarding the funds which has been allotted to Tansacs during the past 10 years, the amount spent it every year and the project undertaken by Tansacs. The judges also queried whether auditing of funds is done every year and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing. It may be recalled that in December 2018, blood from a HIV positive person was transfused to a 23-year-old pregnant woman at the Sattur government hospital in Virudhunagar district.

"14 years on, Bombay high court gives HIV+ve man Coast Guard job back","MUMBAI: After a 14-year legal battle, a Coast Guard employee who was discharged as an invalid on being diagnosed with HIV and tuberculosis has been or.",,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: After a 14-year legal battle, a Coast Guard employee who was discharged as an invalid on being diagnosed with HIV and tuberculosis has been ordered to be reinstated immediately by the high court after he passed a fitness test. He will not get back wages, but the continuity of service will be taken into account to ensure he gets pension on retirement. The employee, whom the Bombay high court designated Mr X, joined the Indian Coast Guard in 1995 and worked as a sweeper, office boy, sentry and even served four years at sea. In 2003, he tested positive for HIV and TB, and was discharged on grounds of invalidation with 100% disability. He challenged the order in the high court in 2005 invoking his right to equality. His petition said in October 2004, his non-contagious TB had been declared cured and his health had improved with medication. Mr X filed a medical opinion that HIV patients may not be unfit for the nature of work he is allotted. In 2017, the HC directed a medical board to conduct a fitness test. A report submitted the next year found him fit. Finally, last week, the HC directed his immediate reinstatement in the interest of justice. The court did not accept a plea by counsel Ram Apte for the coast guard for another fitness test since a year had elapsed after the last one. But the HC accepted Aptes submission that Mr X would be subjected to regular annual fitness tests in future like other personnel. Counsel Deviyani Kulkarni, representing Mr X, pointed out that the 2018 fitness report said the petitioner is fit to be reinstated. There remains no reason not to reinstate him since as prescribed by guidelines and as per the principles of natural justice, one cannot be discriminated against for being tested positive for HIV, said Kulkarni. In 2003, the coast guard had discharged Mr X by invoking rule 26, which says a person, if found to be permanently unfit for coast guard services by a medical board, may be retired, released or discharged from service. Later, the Naval Insurance Group sent a letter for payment of disability benefits. He was eligible for Rs 2 lakh as disability benefits. After Mr X moved the HC in 2005, it directed the coast guard to file a reply within four weeks. After filing the affidavit, the coast guard requested for an adjournment. Once the case resumed, Mr X filed a medical opinion that an HIV-affected person could carry on duties that he used to be allotted; the Centre and coast guard again sought time to file a reply. In July 2008, the HC bench of Justices J N Patel and K K Tated directed that the hearings be expedited. Finally, in 2017, the HC directed a fitness test for Mr X. He was declared fit, and the report was submitted in 2018, but still a year passed. Last week, a bench of Justices Bhushan Gavai and N J Jamadar questioned why even after the fitness test report, his reinstatement had not been ordered. The bench directed the coast guard to immediately reinstate him. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

Give LGBTI free gender transition services in government hospitals: Experts,"CHANDIGARH: In the absence of a national guideline on the management of transgender and intersex issues, the public health experts proposed that free .",Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: In the absence of a national guideline on the management of transgender and intersex issues, the public health experts proposed that free or subsidised gender transition services for the community should be given in government hospitals after proper informed consent, at least in tertiary level government hospitals to begin with. This was proposed at the two-day national conference on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) that concluded on Sunday at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI). The experts have come out with recommendations to be sent to the union ministry of health, ministry of social justice and empowerment, ICMR and MCI. ""Two years ago, the Indian Council of Medical Research had constituted a task force to develop such national guidelines. What happened to them, we have no idea,"" said Dr Venkatesan Chakrapani, DBT India Alliance senior fellow, department of community medicine, PGI. It was recommended that the surrogacy laws and policies on artificial reproductive technologies should consider the need of LGBTI people. The panelists proposed the need for a proper consent from trans youth and intersex people, before irreversible genital surgeries. There are some cancers which are common in the lesbian and gay population. But the awareness is low in such areas. ""Thus, overall, health-related research among LGBTI people need to move beyond HIV risk and comprehensively address a range of physical and mental health needs and social well-being,"" said Dr Chakrapani. The experts felt that the medical, nursing and paramedical curriculum need to provide correct information about LGBTI people. It has been recommended that continuous medical education programmes should be initiated by the Indian medical professional associations. ""We urge the medical council of India to review its recent competency based curriculum, which still contains certain inaccuracies regarding representation of LGBTI issues, including considering sodomy and lesbianism,which have been decriminalised by the Supreme Court of India as sexual offences,"" said Dr P V M Lakshmi, professor of epidemiology, department of community medicine, PGI.

Telangana: Qualified doctors to oversee all vaccination drives in state,Min,,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Days after two toddlers died after they were wrongly administered painkillers after vaccination, the government has decided that qualified doctors have to be physically present to oversee vaccination drives in future. Currently, in a vaccination drive, nearly 60-70 percent of the staff present are volunteers which comprises teachers, students as well as other professionals. Speaking to TOI, state helath minister, Etala Rajender said that the huge task of training volunteers, ANMs and nursing staff has been identified for action. The physical presence of qualified personnel is meant to cut out the chances of administering wrong medications like in the recent case of Tramadol tablet being administered to infants instead of paracetamol syrup at the Nampally Urban health centre. Also a similar incident was reported at Sircilla last year, where many infants between one to six months of age had to be hospitalised. Moreover, plans have also been charted to upscale vaccination drives for eradicating polio, leprosy, tuberculosis and AIDS which means a bigger requirement to cut out 'human errors' in such drives. ""We will be focussing more on preservation and storage of vaccines. For this cold storage chain system will be strengthened. A plan is being currently prepared for the same. Also while administering vaccines and medications required post vaccination, the physical presence of a qualified doctor will be ensured. A action plan is being prepared,"" said the minister. Training will also be given to asha workers, auxiliary nurse midwives, nursing staff and medical staff at primary health centres 'for quality improvement'. Meanwhile, the health condition of majority of the infants admitted at the state run Niloufer hospital is stable, said health authorities. One out of the 15 infants who were kept under observation was given a blood transfusion on Saturday night after the haemoglobin count declined. The infant is stable said authorities. While 19 infants were discharged on Saturday, the remaining are expected to be discharged on Monday. No infants were discharged on Sunday.

"Treat HIV students with care, educationists get lesson",PANAJI: Heads of institutions and teachers have been urged to stop any discrimination of students living with HIV and maintain confidentiality.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Heads of institutions and teachers have been urged to stop any discrimination of students living with HIV and maintain confidentiality. Considering schools in the past have been found discriminating against children living with HIV, the sensitisation session for them also threw light on the medical and health aspects of children living with HIV and the stigma attached to it. The half-day sensitisation workshop Lets End HIV Stigma was held for nearly 50 teachers, principals and lecturers from Salcete and Mormugao talukas, with an aim of improving the mindsets and approach of educational institutions when dealing with children and adolescents living with HIV. Participants were urged to sensitise teachers and non-teaching staff in their educational institutions not to further stigmatise any children living with HIV and maintain confidentiality of their status. Stigma is still a factor for many children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, founder of Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges stated. The Goa State AIDS Control Society team, headed by Dr Chandrakant Parab, encouraged the participants not to discriminate against the children or anybody living with HIV, while the senior medical officer of the anti-retroviral therapy centre, Dr Wanda Viegas also educated the participants on the medical and health aspects of people living with HIV and why they need to adhere to regular treatment. She also cleared multiple doubts on the subject. Considering stigma is still a factor for many children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, interventions are still required to correct misconceptions that HIV can be transmitted via casual contact with children living with HIV, founder of Just Imagine, Harry Patel said during the programme. Borges called for introspection in relation to self-awareness, attitudes, values and beliefs and pointed out that these factors affect the HIV stigma and discrimination and stressed on their importance if the state has to achieve zero HIV discrimination by 2030.

Apart from this, the accused was also sentenced for 10 years imprisonment and was slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh under another section. If failed to pay the fine, he should undergo simple imprisonment for two years under the section 376(2) (n) of IPC. The substantive portion of the sentence shall run concurrently, the judgment said. Additional public prosecutor C Vidhu said that it was an anganwadi worker who brought the incident to the light in 2013. The survivor revealed to the anganwadi worker when she was 19 years old that she had been raped by her father since her childhood. Following this, the anganwadi worker approached Kudumbashree Mission, who informed police. Police then registered a case and arrested the accused. The accused, who was working in Mumbai, was infected with HIV. His wife died of AIDS in October 2012. However, he continued to rape his daughter and she also became an HIV patient, said Vidhu. Considering the type of abuse, gravity of the offences and the severity of the mental or physical harm or injury suffered by the survivor; the expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on her medical treatment for physical and mental health; loss of educational opportunity, I am of the view that this is a fit case, in which, a reasonable compensation as scheduled in the Kerala Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014, can be awarded. As the accused is life convict suffering from HIV positive, there is seldom chance for the realization of the said fine amount from him. So the court here by makes a recommendation to the District Legal Service Authority, Alappuzha, for taking a judicious decision for the fixation of quantum of compensation to be awarded under the victim compensation scheme, the judgment said.

"No vaccines for swine flu as deaths, cases surge",NAGPUR: The number of deaths from swine flu in the city has increased to 14 and that of positive cases to 208 this year.,,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: The number of deaths from swine flu in the city has increased to 14 and that of positive cases to 208 this year. Shockingly, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and government hospitals are not having any stock of H1N1 vaccine. NMC health officer Dr Sarita Kamdar on Friday told reporters NMC was likely to get 375 vials vaccine this month. The state government used to provide the vaccine but has not supplied any since June last year. Government asked NMC to procure vaccine on its own. We have placed orders but are getting only 375 vials. We will administer these to pregnant women, she said. It is mandatory to administer this injectable vaccine on pregnant, hypersensitive, HIV patients and paramedical staff for prevention of swine flu infection. Even if the NMC gets these vials only 375 people would be covered. Kamdar said vaccine was not available even with government hospitals and private pharmacies in the city. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said NMC 208 positive cases and 14 deaths happened between January 1 and March 8. Eight of 14 deaths were from city while others from adjoining districts. Similarly, 135 of 208 positive patients were from city and rest from other districts, he said. Joshi said 12,000 people were screened in the last few days. NMC has begun screening people residing in 100 houses situated near home of one positive patient. 584 suspected cases were found and Tamiflu was given to 325 persons, he said. Nodal medical officer Dr Sunil Ghurde said NMC had opened screening centres at its 42 health centres. Our team is monitoring cases at zone levels as well as in private hospitals. Tamiflu is made available at all centres, he said. City has registered large number of cases in January, February and March for the first time. In 2018, 27 deaths and 149 positive cases were registered of which most were in post monsoon period. Joshi said, It is probably due to continuation of cold temperatures and high humidity. He also said pulse polio drops would be administered to children below 5 years of age at 1,300 booths on March 10.

"Kerala: Pre-marital sex leads to AIDS, says textbook",The biology textbook for Class X under the Kerala state syllabus has been giving a misleading information on AIDS for almost three years.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The biology textbook for Class X under the Kerala state syllabus has been giving a misleading information on AIDS for almost three years. A snippet from the textbook has now gone viral in social media following which the authorities have come under attack for spreading wrong information and not bothering to correct it all these years. In Chapter 4, titled 'Keeping diseases away', on page 60, pre-marital and extra marital sexual contact have been cited as the reasons for spread of AIDS. It was an open letter to education minister C Ravindranath by a higher secondary school teacher on Facebook which exposed the glaring mistake that was passed on to students in the form of AIDS awareness. Geetha N S, a botany teacher in a higher secondary school in Malappuram, posted on FB on February 24: ""My friend's daughter in Class X approached me to learn the subject. It was then that I noticed the blunder. When I asked my friends teaching in Class X, I understood it was being taught at least for the past three years,"" said Geetha, who is a botany teacher in a higher secondary school in Malappuram. Geetha said that Plus Two textbooks, on the other hand, clearly mentions that unsafe sex was one of the reasons for transmission of AIDS. The post was shared by several medical practitioners who raised the question on why the curriculum was silent on key topics such as safe sex even as it preached moral policing. Dr Arun N M, consultant of internal medicine and convener of HIV/AIDS cell of Indian Medical Association, Kerala, said those who prepared the textbook should have made it clear that one could get AIDS from having unprotected sex with a person who is infected with the virus. ""The statement in the text book stigmatizes a HIV patient as someone who cheats or is immoral. If a student has a HIV positive parents, imagine their trauma,"" he said. ""Those at counselling centres know that lot of women get infected from their husbands. More informed people should be roped in to provide content for such important topics,"" said Thiruvananthapuram-based doctor Veena J S. State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) director J Prasad said the blunder would be removed from the textbook from the next academic year. He, however, expressed surprise that nobody, including teachers, managed to spot the mistake and bring it to the notice of SCERT for so long.

Transfusion horror: Blood sample of baby sent for HIV test,MADURAI: The blood sample of the baby girl born to a woman who was transfused with HIV-positive blood at the government hospital (GH) at Sattur in Dec.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The blood sample of the baby girl born to a woman who was transfused with HIV-positive blood at the government hospital (GH) at Sattur in December last year when she was pregnant was sent for testing to a laboratory on Monday. The blood would undergo Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test to determine within 30 days whether the baby was born with HIV infection. When the baby was born at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on January 17, the doctors had said that screening for HIV could be done only after it crossed 45 days. With the girl turning 46 days old on Monday, the samples were taken and despatched for the test. Doctors said that the tests would be done two more times  when the girl was 6 months old and one-and-a-half years old. GRH dean Dr K Vanitha said the baby was doing fine and there was in fact an improvement in its weight. Her birthweight was around 1.7kg, but now she weighs 2.8kg and she is very active now, the dean said. The hospital officials said an antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug  Nevirapine  given to prevent HIV infection was being continued for the baby. The doctors said that the babys 23-year-old mother was also fine, but the discharge of both of them who were still admitted at GRH wouldnt be done anytime soon, at least not until the next reassessment. Im happy that my baby is doing fine now, but Im nervous about the test results, the babys 27-year-old father told TOI. The government should take necessary measures to appoint both me and my wife in government jobs soon, as they had assured, he said. On December 3, the blood donated by an HIV-positive teenager was given to the woman when she was admitted to Sattur GH. The teenager donated the blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realizing he was HIV-infected. He later committed suicide after learning about his health condition.

"Pre-marital check-up a must, say Kolkata doctors","KOLKATA: When it comes to matchmaking, horoscope is not the only thing the couples need to check.",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: When it comes to matchmaking, horoscope is not the only thing the couples need to check. Though a few nowadays go for pre-marital health check-ups, the number is still far from satisfactory. But, doctors said that such check-ups can avoid some unwanted events in future like that of the birth of a baby with thalassaemia and with certain disorders. On Saturday, Ruby General Hospital (RGH) announced its pre-marriage checkup clinic. Currently, NRS Medical College and Hospital runs clinic for antenatal thalassaemia screening. There are many couples, who approach us with haematological reports and ask us to help in charting their future plans. Thats why we have decided to come up with this clinic, said Subhasish Datta, general manager (operations) at RGH. Apart from running thalassaemia, HIV and blood group screening tests, the clinic also offers analysis to determine the couples emotional and psychological compatibility. The hospital has roped in Bonding Tree, an organisation that has been conducting such pre-marital health check-ups in the city. While analysing couples on their expectations from each other, at times we find some disparity. We can help them narrow the gap, said Sukanta Mitra, psychologist with Bonding Tree. In fact, more hospitals should come up with this kind of clinic and such check-ups should become mandatory for couples, who are planning to get married, said Dr D P Sammader, director medical affairs at RGH. If a couple wants to get married despite both or one of them being thalassaemia carrier, we cant discourage them. But they will at least have a choice as far as having a child is concerned. In fact, all obstetricians should ask married couples for antenatal screening for thalassaemia, said Dr Prantar Chakrabarti, head of haematology at NRS.

"Mainstream political parties, separatists flay ban on Jamaat",India News: SRINAGAR: Both mainstream political parties and separatist leaders on Friday reacted strongly to the Centre banning Jammu and Kashmir’s Jamaat-e-Islam.,,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"SRINAGAR: Both mainstream political parties and separatist leaders on Friday reacted strongly to the Centre banning Jammu and Kashmirs Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and expressed dismay over the governments decision. Among the mainstream parties, Omar Abdullahs National Conference (NC) expressed dismay over the Centres decision and said suppression would breed radicalization. Interesting to note that late Sheikh Abdullah, former J&K CM and grandfather of Omar, had banned Jamaat in the early 80s and even dismantled their madrassas across the Kashmir Valley. Even Omars father Farooq Abdullah had in 1988 banned Jamaat after it resurfaced with a different name. The Abdullahs had always been staunch opponents of Jamaat and they more often blamed PDP for enjoying the support of the outfits activists. Expressing disappointment over the ban, NC general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar said, By ideology, we mean a specific mindset. It can be tackled by arguments. By banning Jamaat-e-Islami, the government will achieve nothing other than giving it a dissident glamour. The move will not help, it will rather impede the process of reconciliation and rapprochement in our state. It does not augur well for a working democracy like ours to ban socio-political outfits. While banning Jamaat on Thursday, the Union home ministry had said: JeI has been indulging in activities which are prejudicial to internal security and public order, and have the potential of disrupting the unity and integrity of the country. During 1988-89, Jamaat had supported militancy only indirectly, but it got directly involved under the influence of Pakistan's ISI by forming Hizbul Mujahideen as its militant wing. J&K Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone too criticized the Centres move. He termed the ban on Jamaat as against ethos, ideals and essence of a vibrant democracy, and advocated for an early revocation of the unfair ban. Condemning the government decision, Sajjad said the true test of democracy lay in allowing space to oppose political thoughts and ideologies rather than putting a cage around people with a certain political orientation. He also appreciated JeIs contribution to social and political spheres. Why has Jamaat been banned? Jamaat is a social, political and religious organisation. In a vibrant democracy, ideas have to be fought not banned. This organisation has given us illustrious leaders and legislators. How can they be banned? I strongly pitch for revocation of the ban (sic), the PC chairman tweeted. Disapproving the ban on Jamaat, PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti said such a decision would further shrink the space for political rapprochement and reconciliation in J&K. Addressing a meeting of senior party leaders, Mehbooba said the Centre was adopting an ostrich-like approach towards Kashmir, which was reeling from a dreadful crisis. She said Jamaat had been credited for running schools and that it was a totally non-violent socio-religious organization. On many occasions, Jamaat had publicly disapproved of violence as a method of political struggle, she added. The Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) leaders and activists on Friday staged a protest in Srinagar against the ban. JKLF and activists of two factions of Hurriyat together assembled in Lal Chowk here after Friday prayers and protested against the government decision. The authorities had imposed restrictions in several parts of old Srinagar on Friday to avert any untoward incident. Meanwhile, the authorities have sealed a private school in Ajas area of north Kashmirs Bandipora district. According to them, the school was being run by Jamaat. In another crackdown, at least six Jamaat activists were detained from various villages of Tral in south Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday night. Earlier this week, over 200 Jamaat activists and leaders were arrested in a massive crackdown across the Valley.

"At Delhi mall, transgenders say with pride they’re Born This Way","Days after Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which condemned LGBTQ citizens to humiliation and denial, was read down by the Supreme Court, the tra",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Days after Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which condemned LGBTQ citizens to humiliation and denial, was read down by the Supreme Court, the transgender community came together in strength and solidarity on Tuesday at Delhis Select Citywalk for the annual Hijra Habba. Organised by the HIV/AIDS Alliance India, the event, whose theme this year was Born This Way, brings together transgender advocates, international agencies and health organisations to present their perspectives, with song and dance and much good cheer. We are the only sexual minority that is visible to the naked eye, said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, a prominent activist and head of the first transgender religious akhara. While hijras and transgender groups once had important roles in Indian society, they are yet to fully realise their freedoms. They are cast out of familial structures and political decision-making, leaving Tamanna Keni, 26, an activist from Thane, to rue, We used to be the mahalon ki zeenat (pride of the palaces) in Mughal times and the Maratha durbars had a place for us, but now we are left behind. A survey of the National Human Rights Commission has established that 92% of the transgender community are economically marginalised. They rely on begging and sex work, and frequently face discrimination, even violence. A full 98% of transgender persons live apart from their families, so have for support their chosen gurus (the person your heart goes out to, as Tamanna described the relationship) and their peers. This gives them a sense of community, but also sharpens their isolation from wider society. The Hijra Habba, in that sense, is an attempt to connect the community within itself and with others. Tuesdays event started with a flash mob by the group Harmless Hugs. Many visitors were intrigued enough to stay and listen. I had only heard myths, or seen hijras at ceremonies like weddings or births. I was just curious, admitted Puneet Kumar, a 24-year-old MNC executive. He clapped enthusiastically at drag queen (also Mr Gay India 2014) Rani Kohinoors versions of Ambar sariya and I will survive almost as if responding to the emcees exhortation: Iss function mein taaliyon ki kami nahi honi chahiye. The Indian state recognises gender-variant identities in public documents, and many states like Tamil Nadu have dedicated transgender welfare programmes. The Supreme Courts groundbreaking Nalsa judgment in 2014 made a basis for self-identified gender identity  the fact that you know the gender you identify with, irrespective of medical diagnosis, and that the law must give you your full due as a citizen. A transgender rights bill is pending in Parliament. Officials from agencies like the HIV/AIDS Alliance, National AIDS Control Organisation, USAID and UNAIDS spoke of being in this together. Cricketer Gautam Gambhir too expressed his support, congratulating everyone on the dilution of Section 377. Activist Gauri Sawant, one of those who had moved the Supreme Court on behalf of the transgender community, spoke of giving back to society and how one could invest care and attention on others. Sawant, who works in an initiative called Nani ka Ghar for the children of sex workers, said her own sense of family was Mere chele mere bachche hain. She explained, Motherhood is a behaviour, it doesnt mean giving birth to a baby. An exhibition at the event introduced visitors to the transgender community, what it means to identify as a woman or man, the behaviours one learns by wearing a bindi or holding up a false moustache. It introduced people to prominent trans persons and to cultural references like Bahuchara Mata, a patron deity of the hijra community. To walk through the space is to understand what it means to be born in the way we all are but being force-fitted into a rigid gender identity.

‘Proactive’ strategy against externment order violators,PUNE: The police registered 250 cases under the Maharashtra Police Act in 2018 against externed criminals found violating the externment orders by ill.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"PUNE: The police registered 250 cases under the Maharashtra Police Act in 2018 against externed criminals found violating the externment orders by illegally entering the city limits. Charge sheets were filed against 201 of these offenders. We are specifically pursuing this legal option in the wake of rising instances of externed criminals entering the city limits and indulging in criminal activities, Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said on Friday. One of the effective steps towards checking such violations is to secure a speedy trial for such offences. Section 142 of the Maharashtra Police Act provides for summary trial in such cases. We are proactively moving courts within 24 hours of such violations for a speedy summary trial, he said. Criminals on police records with two or more offences of serious nature against their names, especially cases where people have been either threatened or subjected to criminal force, are externed from the Pune city and district limits for periods ranging from one to two years. In the past four months, many externed criminals have been arrested in the city limits carrying fire arms and sharp weapons or while attempting to loot cash of the ATM kiosks. One of the externees was found enjoying dinner at his Bibvewadi residence recently by the night patrol staff of the police. DCP (Crime) Shirish Sardeshpande said, It is a gross violation of externment orders. The number is high and we are taking all the precautions to avert such incidents in the future. In 2018, externment orders were issued against 113 criminals as against 159 in 2017, 99 in 2016 and 82 in 2015.

Probe indicts several staff for HIV+ blood transfusion,CHENNAI: The state government has decided to take strict action against the healthcare professionals responsible for the mix-up that led to a pregnant.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The state government has decided to take strict action against the healthcare professionals responsible for the mix-up that led to a pregnant woman being given HIV-infected blood in a Sivaganga hospital and to formulate rules that will clearly fix responsibility for every step of the blood collection, storage and transfusion process. The six-member inquiry committee headed by the additional director of medical services, Dr S Madhavi, indicted the district blood bank professionals, staff and voluntary testing centre counsellor in Sivakasi, and the Chennai-based monitoring officers working with the Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society. A senior health official said, We have an existing guideline which tells blood bank professionals what they should do. The new one will fix responsibilities on who should conduct camps, who should draw blood and who should maintain cold chain. We have suspended two lab technicians, Valarmathi and Ganesh Babu, along with lab counsellor Ramesh. We also found that the seniors they reported to, including senior blood bank officials and district monitoring officials, were negligent. We will be initiating action against all of them, said a senior official. The counsellor was aware of the HIV status of the donor in 2016 but did not persistently call the donor or escalate the case to higher officials when unable to get in touch with the donor. District monitoring officials, who should have sought regular status reports from the counsellor, did not follow up on the case. Lab technicians say they tested the blood before labelling it as safe, the committee said and added that the kits used by the government were provided by National AIDS Control Organisation and did not fail quality tests. In this case, we have reason to believe that the tests were never done and the blood bank managers too failed to monitor blood safety, the official said.

Brush with reality: The true colours of Indian farmers,"When Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra started travelling to the rural hinterlands of Punjab and rest of the country about seven years back, there was on",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"By: Swati.Bhan CHANDIGARH: When Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra started travelling to the rural hinterlands of Punjab and rest of the country about seven years back, there was one thought that cut across their minds invariably. How difficult was it to brush down the pain and trauma of the farm distress over a canvas? But they believed, they had to, as it was the only way they knew to put across the agony of the farmers to the society at large. And years later, the two artists have brought out an exhibition of these paintings highlighting the distress caused by the farmer suicides in the rural areas of the state as well as the country. The exhibition, titled Farmer is Wrestler, began at Punjab Lalit Kala Academy from Wednesday. The exhibition will remain open till March 5 for art lovers. Not new to the subject the artist duo who are a native of Punjab say that their familiarisation with the subject of farmers' suicide and farm distress have been on for the last one decade. ""It was a research that was published in a daily about 10 years ago on the lack of government interest that provoked our thoughts to work on this subject,'' said Thukral. For giving their work a realistic touch, the two decided to travel to the epicentres of the farm distress not just in Punjab but rest of the country. ""Travelling in different parts of the country and having interacted with farmers in all these years we realised that farming and distress had become synonyms in different parts of the country,'' said Tagra. They say that in cases especially in Punjab it was the dream and aspiration of escape for a dreamland that led to the detachment from the soil. ""Many wanted to get away from the problem that they were apprehending, depleting water levels and rising loans but it was the growing aspirations and lack of opportunities that has put the farming community at a crossroad,"" said Tagra. The artists have equated the farmers metaphorically to wresters who are also connected to the soil raised questions on several aspects of the farmers desperation including the latest farmers rally held in the capital. ""The images of the farmers with skulls in their hand had got imprinted in our minds and we wanted to bring it to images that led to this kind of display of sorrow,"" said Thukral. As artists the duo say that they do want to ensure that the message of the reasons for distress is not just pondered upon but solutions be brought about to reduce the number of suicides. And it was not only the people in power who could do that but common people too could play an effective role in protecting the producers of food, commented the two. With a combination of canvas and sculpture that are exhibited in the academy gallery, the artists have left their thoughts as open ended questions for the visitors to realise. This is not the first time that they have focused on serious issues like this one. ""We had exhibitions earlier on issues like HIV and we intend to draw our attention toward education as well,"" said Thukral.

The child last underwent a blood,,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"COIMBATORE: A two-year-old baby tested positive for the HIV virus last week at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, despite her parents and twin brother testing negative for the same. The parents allege the child could have got the virus only from blood or a fluid transfusion. They also say that the child last underwent a blood transfusion at CMCH in July last year, and it could have been the only source for the infection. CMCH authorities, however, said they have traced the transfused blood back, and have documents to prove that it is HIV-negative. The child's father, a powerloom worker, saw his world turn upside down on April 8 when the government hospital informed him that his baby girl was HIV positive. They told him that he, his wife and baby son, the victim's twin, had tested negative. ""I know that it can only come from a blood or fluid transfusion,"" he said. ""The last hospital she was admitted in was CMCH, on July 11, 2018. On July 12, they gave her blood. They diagnosed her with a congenital heart problem, but allowed us to go home the next day, saying the heart would heal on its own,"" he added. The twins were born in February 2017, at the Trichy Government Hospital. Born more than two months premature, the girl baby weighed just 700 gm, according to hospital records.

Telangana: Revised pension scheme to raise govt expenses by 100%,HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's poll promise to decrease the eligibility age from 65 years to 57 years to avail old-age pension is all.,,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao's poll promise to decrease the eligibility age from 65 years to 57 years to avail old-age pension is all set to cost a bomb to the state exchequer. The expenditure on social security pensions will now jump from Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore per annum. The reason for the expenditure increasing by almost 100 per cent is due to KCRs promise of doubling the pensions for the aged and specially-challenged, in addition to reducing the age criteria. The state government has spent about Rs 5,000 crore per annum on extending Aasara (social security) pensions to various category of beneficiaries including the aged, specially-challenged, widows and single women, to name a few. Chief secretary S K Joshi told TOI that the exercise of collecting data of newly eligible beneficiaries (pensioners) aged between 57 and 64 years is in progress. KCR's poll promise of extending enhanced pensions would be doled out from April 1, he said. Officials are estimating that another 8 lakh to 10 lakh pensioners aged between 57 and 64 years are expected to be added to the existing list of pensioners and that the state government is likely to incur an additional expenditure of Rs 5,000 crore. It may be mentioned that KCR, during the recent assembly elections, had promised to reduce the age eligibility criteria from 65 years to 57 years for Aasara pensions, in addition to enhancing the monthly pension from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,016 for the aged and from Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,016 for the specially-challenged. Till date, the existing beneficiaries aged 65 years and above who are getting Rs 1,000 pension per month are 13.30 lakh. Officials are trying to complete the identification process of beneficiaries aged between 57 and 64 years at the earliest. The exercise to finalise the data of new beneficiaries will pick up speed once the state government issues GO for the same, an official said.

The letter, written by the organisations founder and CEO Peter Borges, states that this is completely unbecoming, inhuman and unexpected in the healthcare setting. This will not only increase stigma and discrimination, but also deter thousands of people living with HIV from accessing treatment. Borges said people, including those with HIV, expect from GMC healthcare services that are decent, respectful and free of prejudice and stigma. The plaint has also been sent to the project director of Goa state aids control society, GMC dean Dr Pradeep Naik, its medical superintendent, Dr Shivanand Bandekar and director of health services, Dr Sanjeev Dalvi.

HIV-positive woman in labour denied admission at UP govt hospital,The district hospital in Bijnor allegedly refused to conduct caesarean section of an HIV-positive woman in labour when she was brought there on Wednes,,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"BIJNOR: The district hospital in Bijnor allegedly refused to conduct caesarean section of an HIV-positive woman in labour when she was brought there on Wednesday. Despite repeated pleas to the chief medical superintendent (CMS), the woman was referred to a higher centre. After the woman was brought to the district hospital, tests indicated she was HIV-positive. After this, hospital staff allegedly refused to conduct the surgery. The woman and her family members pleaded to the staff, but they did not relent. I am in unbearable pain. I requested the CMS to give me admission, but she refused. I am from a poor family and cant afford expensive treatment, said the woman, a resident of Nagina area in Bijnor, at the premises of the district hospital. She was taken to Meerut Medical College in critical condition and is still in labour at the time of filing of this report. The woman is a native of Mumbai and married a Nagina man a few years ago. Her husband works in Delhi and they are financially deprived. The husband is not HIV-positive, said a district hospital staff with access to the womans medical record. Hospital authorities on the other hand cited lack of adequate facilities as the reason for turning the woman away. CMS Dr Abha Verma said, We have only one operation theatre and the mattress on which the operation is conducted needs to be destroyed after surgery on an AIDS patient. Besides, all surgical equipment also gets contaminated. The sterilisation process takes at least four days, which means the operation theatre needs to be shut down for that period. Our hospital has to conduct 7-8 deliveries per day. It is mandatory to carry out ceasarean section if the woman is HIV-positive. It is done for the safety of the newborn. Meerut Medical College was suitable for it, therefore we had to refer her there.

Sahu's ordeal started when he saw an advertisement in a local newspaper calling for kidney donors. Sahu decided to offer his kidney to help the man in need and contacted a local hospital in the city. Following the preliminary medical check-up, the hospital found that Sahu is infected with HIV. The hospital's faulty diagnosis marked a turning point in Sahu's life. His marriage broke down. His family and friends abandoned him. Heartbroken, Sahu started contemplating suicide. Not ready to give up on his life, Sahu approached a private hospital in Kolkata with the help of one of his friends. Another round of tests found Sahu to be perfectly healthy. Bewildered, Sahu sought another opinion from a hospital based in Alipore. There too the tests came out as negative. Sahu immediately approached the consumer court against the first hospital, responsible for his misdiagnoses. After hearing Sahu's case, the court ordered the hospital to give a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to Sahu. ""I want to start again. Want to live again,"" Sahu said.

"GMC reveals identity of HIV+ man, kin in trauma","PANAJI: In a blatant violation of confidentiality over the status of an HIV positive patient, Goa Medical College on Tuesday afternoon affixed a ‘Univ.",,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: In a blatant violation of confidentiality over the status of an HIV positive patient, Goa Medical College on Tuesday afternoon affixed a Universal Precaution board on the patients bed, causing much distress to the family besides casting stigma. The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patients children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions. TimesViewDiscriminating against and victimising an HIV/AIDS patient is not only condemnable, it is also criminal. This single insensitive act by the states premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment. Under the central law that provides for stiff punishment against all actions that may lead to hostility against HIV patients, both, the person who ordered the placing of the board on the patients bed and implementor, must be punished. Also, the state government must immediately see to it that all staffers of GMC, medical and otherwise, are apprised about the proper ethics to be followed in treating HIV patients and the consequences in case of failure to do so.The doctors, nurses, attendants and even those who bring food and clean the patient know about the health status. It is clearly written in all the papers appended in the treatment file too. I cant understand why this board was put, a close relative of the patient said. The hospital should be helping such people who may not live for long. If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away, she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed. The staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patients head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, wont they reveal the health status? she asked. Even the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. Its a big shame for us. Im going mad, she said. The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities. Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology. We have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again, he told TOI. Universal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patients bed, CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said. This is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings, Borges said.

Ranthambore hotels stare at mass cancellation of bookings,JAIPUR: The Gujjar agitation blocking the Delhi-Mumbai railway tracks that pass through Sawai Madopur has dwelt a tell ing blow to the tourism industr.,,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"JAIPUR: The Gujjar agitation blocking the Delhi-Mumbai railway tracks that pass through Sawai Madopur has dwelt a tell ing blow to the tourism industry in Ranthambore with the hotel industry facing the prospects of mass cancellations in the peak tourist season. Tour operators and hoteliers in Ranthambore said with no end to the stir in sight, its now very difficult for them to convince the clients to take long detours and brace for the painful inevitability. February and March are the peak months for tourism in Ranthambore, engaging not only the hotels but also everybody starting from egg sellers to vegetable vendors. But the Gujjar agitation is now having a devastating impact on every economic activity in the destination. All booking for the next 10 days are set to be cancelled, said Balendu Singh, an hotelier and former honourary wildlife warden of Ranthambore. In the last four days since the strike broke out, tour operators managed to convince tourists who had booked in advance to take alternative routes to reach there. In normal times, it used to take about four hours from Agra to Ranthambore but now as they take diversions, they (mostly foreign tourist groups) have to spend 8-9 hours for the journey. Even for the people in Delhi or north India looking to visit Ranthambore, the disincentive is that they have to reach there via Jaipur. As the deadlock continues, the foreign tourists are being given alternative destinations instead of Ranthambore. Even as we managed the situation in the last 3-4 days, its impossible now to avert mass cancellations, said Bhupender Singh Shekhawat, a local tour operator. Ranthambore has around 130 hotels with about 2600 rooms and they are dependent on seasonal business. Balendu Singh said the cancellations are set to shave off 25% of their total business in the two months. When TOI spoke to tourism minister Vishvendra Singh, he said the tourism industry will take a massive hit because of the agitation and the government is trying out all options for a resolution through dialogue. Like everything, tourism has also been impacted by the agitation. We are trying for an early resolution, added Singh.

Kerala: HIV positive man awarded life term for raping daughter,ALAPPUZHA: City's additional district and sessions court awarded life term to a 50-year-old HIV positive man for raping his daughter.,,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"ALAPPUZHA: City's additional district and sessions court awarded life term to a 50-year-old HIV positive man for raping his daughter. According to the judgement pronounced by judge SH Panchapakesan on Monday, the life term shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life and the court has also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the accused under section 376(2)(f) of the IPC. The accused was also sentenced to undergo imprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh. If he failed to pay the fine, he should undergo simple imprisonment for two years under section 376(2)(n) of the IPC. The substantive portion of the sentence shall run concurrently, the judgement read. Additional public prosecutor C Vidhu said it was an anganwadi worker, which brought the incident to the light in 2013. ""The victim was 19-years-old then and she told the anganwadi worker that she was being raped by her father since her childhood days. Following this, the anganwadi worker approached Kudumbashree Mission. Following it, the police had registered a case and arrested the accused person. The accused has two children- a daughter and a son. The accused contracted the disease while working in Mumbai. His wife died of AIDS in October 2012. However, he continued to rape his daughter and she also got infected with the virus,"" said C Vidhu. ""Considering the type of abuse, the gravity of the offences and the severity of the mental or physical harm or injury suffered by the victim; the expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on her medical treatment for physical and mental health; loss of educational opportunity, I am of the view that this is a fit case, in which, a reasonable compensation as scheduled in the Kerala Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014, can be awarded. As the accused is life convict suffering from HIV positive, there is seldom chance for the realisation of the said fine amount from him. So the court here by makes a recommendation to the District Legal Service Authority, Alappuzha for taking a judicious decision for the fixation of quantum of compensation to be awarded under the victim compensation scheme,"" the judgement read.

Income support scheme: Farmers urge government to do away with ‘agents’,"TRICHY: With the government kick-starting the process of identifying beneficiaries for income support scheme, those running photocopy centres, petty s.",,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"TRICHY: With the government kick-starting the process of identifying beneficiaries for income support scheme, those running photocopy centres, petty shops and even some grocery stores in Lalgudi area have started selling application forms at Rs 10 each without the knowledge of the revenue department. Terming that it is against government norms, farmers have urged officials to stop such sale to ensure that the application is available only with the revenue department to avert any irregularity. Since it is a populist scheme, each step should be taken with care, so that irregularities or fraudulent activities which would ultimately affect the gullible farming community, are averted. So, no one should be allowed to sell any application, state spokesperson of Bharathiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran said. During the process of identifying genuine beneficiaries, everything should be done by the revenue department personnel without involving any agent or agency. Otherwise, it will definitely lead to irregularities and end with corruption. The ultimate loser would be the farmers, the Trichy district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI, Ayilai Sivasuriyan said. Union finance minister Piyush Goyal had announced in the interim budget that each eligible farmer would get Rs 6,000 per annum as per the scheme and it is expected that 74 lakh farmers in Tamil Nadu may be covered under it. The money would be transferred directly into the bank accounts of farmers holding less than five acres of land. Following the state governments notification, collectors of all districts have invited eligible farmers to register their names with required documents with their respective village administrative officers (VAOs). They commenced the process on Monday and started collecting documents along with an application containing details of the farmer and his holdings.

Matrimony site for HIV-positive people launched at IIM-A,AHMEDABAD: It’s Cupid for people with HIV.,Tnn,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Its Cupid for people with HIV. A website, launched at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) by Surat-based organizations Sri Rama Krishna (SRK) Group and Gujarat Sate Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+), will connect persons with HIV/AIDS across the globe. An initiative of GSNP+, the website has financial support from SRK Knowledge Foundation and technical support from IIM-A. IIM-A director Errol DSouza said the website represented a progressive step. He said that field surveys indicate that the number of people living with HIV is higher than official estimates.Daksha Patel, the founder of GSNP+, said that about 16 lakh people live with HIV in India. In Gujarat, 68,000 persons regularly visit ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres, she said. The actual number  including those taking treatment at private centres might be higher. With the rise in longevity thanks to modern treatment, there has been an increase in demand for matrimony services. However, this matrimony service works way differently from the standard ones. GSNP has so far organised six major meetings for prospective brides and grooms living with HIV and has been instrumental in 245 weddings in about a decade. The registered members for matrimony are about 1,900. Onerous challenges face patientsIt was Rasik Bhuvas case that became instrumental in starting the matrimony service and eventually the website for GSNP+. I was diagnosed with HIV soon after my engagement. I was quick to break the relationship off citing health issues, said Bhuva. When I started counselling HIV patients, I met a girl from Navsari and we tied the knot. He admitted that even today many prefer not to disclose their positive status to their close family members. We have made it a norm to at least involve one senior family member from both sides to avoid any trouble later, he said. The problem is more acute in rural areas where we go to the patients home as bank or government officials to administer medicines.

Vertical transmission of HIV from moms to babies is nil at tertiary govt hospitals,Visakhapatnam: Vertical transmission of HIV (from pregnant mothers to newborns) has become nil as far as the data from two tertiary government hospita.,,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"Visakhapatnam: Vertical transmission of HIV (from pregnant mothers to newborns) has become nil as far as the data from two tertiary government hospitals in the city shows. The incidences of HIV among antenatal cases are also very few. Doctors attribute it to timely precautions taken, more awareness among patients and administration of ART drugs to the HIV positive mother and child immediately after birth. Head of the department of gynaeocology at King George Hospital (KGH) Dr T Padmavathi informed that vertical transmission is nil at KGH and there is a decline in cases of HIV positive antenatal mothers. With all the required check-ups, precautions and ART medications being used, HIV positive antenatal cases are very few these days and babies born to such mothers too are free from HIV. In 2018, out of 5,671 antenatal mothers, 18 tested HIV positive. But vertical transmission to babies was zero. HIV positive mothers can opt for exclusive breastfeeding of their newborns, stated the gynaecologist. Superintendent of Government Victoria Hospital Dr D Hemalatha informed that in 2018, a total of 8,859 pregnant women had been admitted for delivery out of which 17 had tested HIV positive. But we did not get a single case of HIV positive newborn since the last four years, which shows that vertical transmission is nil now at our hospital. This has been possible by administering ART drugs to HIV positive mothers during pregnancy and nevirapine drops to newborns, she said. Recently, a team from AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) visited KGH to check the HIV treatment and syphilis status. Report would be submitted to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Dr G Arjuna, superintendent of KGH, averred, The team, represented by senior consultant in HIV AIDS Dr TBS Prasad from Vijayawada, stayed for three days and surveyed the ART centre, 24/7 laboratory facility and the microbiology department and enquired about the treatment facilities. They also suggested single prick method, which means blood sample taken from the patient should be tested at a single place for various ailments such as HIV, hepatitis, haemoglobin and so on and the patient need not run around for the tests at different labs.

"Smoke billows from LPG truck, mishap averted",KOCHI: Tense situation prevailed at Kalamassery when smoke billowed from a moving mini-truck laden with cooking gas cylinders near Premier Junction ar.,Tnn,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"KOCHI: Tense situation prevailed at Kalamassery when smoke billowed from a moving mini-truck laden with cooking gas cylinders near Premier Junction around 10am on Saturday. A major tragedy was averted as passers-by used fire extinguishers from another vehicle to douse the blaze. As many as 62 gas cylinders were on the truck. ""Smoke billowed behind driver's seat. Fire had started to engulf one of the cylinders when a passer-by used fire extinguishers to douse the flame. It was a key spot on the highway and underneath the Metro. If it wasn't for the timely intervention of the passer-by, it could have led to a blast,"" said a fire force officer with Eloor fire station. ""Abdul Salam, a youth from HMT Colony, was in another vehicle. He had used a fire extinguisher to douse the fire after which others joined the task. We are planning to felicitate him,"" said councillor Abdul S. Meanwhile, a fire unit rushed to the spot within minutes and brought the situation under control. Fire tenders from Eloor fire station reached the spot by 10.30am. Officials said that the fire might have broken out due to leakage of fuel on to the silencer following a rupture in the pipe from the tank to fuel pump. Fire tenders used dry chemical powder to douse the fire and cooled the cylinders by pouring water to avert a potential explosion after being exposed to the heat. Fire units from Gandhi Nagar and Thrikkakara fire stations had also rushed to the spot. However, they were sent back as Eloor unit brought the fire under control by then. Fire force had continued cooling the cylinders for about 30 minutes before they were removed from the spot in another vehicle. A drill about a potential tanker disaster was held a few months ago at the same spot.

Free travel for specially abled in buses soon,NAGPUR: Physically challenged and specially abled people may soon be able to travel free in Aapli Bus service.,,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: Physically challenged and specially abled people may soon be able to travel free in Aapli Bus service. The Nagpur Municipal Corporations social welfare department has prepared a proposal for this scheme and it will be tabled before the transport committee on February 4. Official sources from the transport department told TOI that on October 20 last year deputy municipal commissioner (social welfare department) Ranjana Lade had informed them of a state government scheme to provide free travel to specially abled persons in city buses. At present, the NMC gives 75% concession to handicapped passengers travelling by Red buses and 50% concession to the companion. First, social justice minister Rajkumar Badole had directed NMC to provide free transport for handicapped persons. Then Lade decided that the companion too will not have to buy a ticket. The money for the free tickets will be allocated from social welfare funds reserved for handicapped persons. This amount will be deposited with the bus operators based on the data provided by DIMTS. The NMC is also providing 100% concession to students of NMC-run schools and HIV positive patients.

Relief for HIV patients: They can now take home 3 months’ drugs,"MUMBAI: For people living with HIV, receiving medicines is as much of a challenge as keeping the virus in check.",,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: For people living with HIV, receiving medicines is as much of a challenge as keeping the virus in check. Every once a month, the person must seek leave from the workplace, arrive early in the morning to a hospital, beat the crowds and queue up for hours to collect the antiretroviral medicines. For a section of people living with HIV, this situation will soon change. In a first, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has decided to give patients the medicine stock for 90-days at a time. Currently, most patients are handed stocks for a month, and in rare instances, for two months. People living with HIV have long wanted this option, which has been tried with success in several African countries. Termed as Differentiated Service Delivery Model (DSDM), it has already been rolled out at ten centres across the country, including KEM Hospital in Parel. Patients, though, will have to meet several criteria to be eligible for DSDM. Primarily, it will be given to those who have been on treatment for at least a year and have 95% adherence rate. The individual has to be clinically fit and free of any side-effects and opportunistic infections (such as tuberculosis) at the time of enrolment, said Dr RS Gupta, deputy director, NACO. Besides making it easier for patients, it will also help to decongest the ART centres, he added. At KEM, over 500 patients have already been identified and enrolled into the programme. The Parel hospital caters to over 1500 people living with HIV. Patients often have problems seeking frequent leaves from their workplace. This initiative will save them repeated visits only for drug refill. It will also save travel costs, said Dr Srikala Acharya, assistant project director at the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). She added that only patients on the first line of treatment and CD4 count (a vital parameter) of more than 500 will be considered for DSDM. Besides Mumbais KEM, centres at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Benaras, and designated hospitals in Manipur, Bhagalpur and Raipur are rolling out the initiative. Talking to TOI, a person living with HIV hailed the model and said it was long-awaited and will go a long way in making life easy for patients. Most HIV-affected people continue to live in anonymity. It, therefore, becomes difficult to explain in offices why one needs to leave every month on fixed days, said the 42-year-old central Mumbai resident. Members of the civil society too have welcomed the decision but cautioned that support systems have to be strengthened for the model to succeed. Its a great initiative particularly for patients who have to visit resource-strapped health facilities. In Mumbai, 17 ART centres cater to nearly 35000 patients. Decongestion of these centres will allow counsellors to spend more time with patients, said HIV activist Ganesh Acharya. However, he said for DSDM to succeed, counselling facilities must be enhanced. Echoing the same, Sachin Awasthi from Vihaan, a patients group that works towards improving adherence, said that the monthly meeting with counsellors and caregivers play an important role. We have to ensure that patients dont start taking their regimes casually, he said.

Mixed response to anti-trafficking bill,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The anti-trafficking bill (2018), which was passed by Lok Sabha, has triggered a debate in state.",,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The anti-trafficking bill (2018), which was passed by Lok Sabha, has triggered a debate in state. Some raised objections against its provisions saying that it was not survivor-centric, while others claimed that it was quite comprehensive. The bill creates a new offence known as aggravated trafficking, which attracts 10 years in prison that may extend to life imprisonment. This is in addition to the existing definition of trafficking under IPC Section 370. However, the logical fallacy of this gradation is evident when it lists trafficking (for begging) as an aggravated offence, whereas trafficking for sexual exploitation is a general offence. We need a legislation that harmonizes various provisions to end trafficking, said MP Shashi Tharoor. He added Centre had promised a comprehensive legislation before the Supreme Court in 2015 in the Prajwala case. The bill only adds to the existing, overlapping cocktail of laws. Through the creation of 10 antitrafficking bodies, it will create more confusion in enforcing laws, said the MP. He added that Clause 16 of the bill  which allows medical examination of survivors  fails to mention that consent of survivors will be taken as and when practicable. This is relevant as there might be people with HIV/ AIDS among survivors and there have been instances where their medical results have been shared with courts without consent. Courts have unfortunately ruled that such persons must remain in rehab homes as their families are unable to take care of them, he said. Activist Sunitha Krishnan  who took efforts to create the bills initial draft  said: Of the 14 chapters in the bill, six focuses on survivors  including their rescue, protection, compensation, relief and rehab. It is the most survivor-centric and gender-neutral bill focused on ending trafficking, she said. Former member of Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights advocate J Sandhya said the bill seeks multiple level systems (national, state, district and local) to prevent trafficking. If more committees are involved, it would be less effective in checking crime. On the compensation fund, it seems to be creating another parallel programme. No funds are offered in the existing compensation fund. Sexual violence and protection of survivors must be handled in totality, she said. Tharoor added that a sum of Rs 10 crore will be allotted by the Centre to the rehab fund whereas the present central government has spent Rs 4,343 crore on publicity since May 2014. This is a bill drafted by the bureaucracy for the bureaucracy, he said.

HIV positive woman lodges complaint against KMCH,CHENNAI: A woman from Mangadu on Saturday lodged a complaint at the city police commissionerate against the staff of Kilpauk Medical College and Hospi.,Tnn,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: A woman from Mangadu on Saturday lodged a complaint at the city police commissionerate against the staff of Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital staff for allegedly transfusing HIV-infected blood to her. On Friday, the woman met media persons and claimed that she learnt she was pregnant in December 2017. She was initially getting treatment at a primary health centre in Mangadu and subsequently, got blood tests, including that for HIV, done at a private hospital and the results showed that she was HIV negative. Her haemoglobin count, however, was found to be low and she was referred by the PHC to undergo blood transfusion at KMCH, she said. The woman underwent treatment at the hospital for around ten days and was discharged once haemoglobin levels improved. A few months later, she went for check up at KMCH and was found to be HIV positive, she said. The woman has alleged that she got the HIV infection after undergoing blood transfusion at KMCH and has accused the hospitals negligence for her plight. The woman and her husband are vegetable vendors. The couple levelled allegations against the staff at the KMCH. We are sure that we contracted the virus from the hospital, since we have results from an earlier test that show my wife didnt have the infection, the womans husband said. When we questioned KMCH staff after she tested positive post transfusion, they told there was not much that could be done now since she has contracted the infection. They argued that they were not responsible for her condition. Some of the staff members even told us that we wont be able to fight the case in court since we did not have the monetary backing to do so, he added. The woman who gave birth to a boy on September 15, said she was administered two units of blood at KMCH in April. The KMCH authorities said there seemed to have been some irregularities with the initial HIV screening done at private labs. They refused to speculate how the woman may have contracted the virus, but insisted that it did not happen at KMCH. Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe on Friday said the blood samples administered to the woman tested safe.

The eight-month pregnant woman was infected when she was admitted at the Sattur Government Hospital in Virudhunagar district on December 3. As the woman and her husband refused to undergo further treatment in Virudhunagar, she was moved to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai. On Saturday, Virudhunagar collector visited the woman at the hospital and enquired about her health and assured her of the best treatment. The collector also handed over a patta for three cents of land near Sattur and a cheque for Rs 2 lakh to them. Meanwhile, during the first day of PMKs executive committee meeting, which was held on Saturday in a marriage hall at Uppilipalayam near Singanallur in Coimbatore, youth wing president Anbumani Ramdoss said that Tamil Nadu health minister Vijayabaskar and health department officials should resign immediately as the department failed to protect two women from HIV infections through blood transfusions. Ramadoss said that during blood donations, HIV and Hepatitis tests should be done by the blood banks. But the HIV infected blood was transfused to two women in the state and it is a very big mistake by the health department, he added. Families of the victims were in a shock, he said.

Drug resistance among top threats: WHO,India News: NEW DELHI: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has been identified as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019 by World Health Organisation (WHO).,,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has been identified as one of the 10 threats to global health in 2019 by World Health Organisation (WHO). The other threats on this list include HIV, Ebola, dengue, vaccine hesitancy, air pollution and climate change. The health organisation has warned that if action is not taken to prevent overuse of antibiotics, we could go back to the time when it was hard to treat infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and salmonellosis. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in India, with drugs even entering our food chain and water, means drug-resistant bacteria is already a major concern here. This is why the Union health ministry has formulated the National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP AMR) 2017-21. Officials said government plans to frame guidelines regarding antibiotic use and over-the-counter sales, ban or restrict their use as growth enhancers in livestock, and improve prescription audits in hospitals and the medical community. AIIMS and some other prominent hospitals are coordinating measurement of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)  infections acquired in hospitals  and sharing protocols to identify and address the gaps. But doctors say more action is required on the ground to prevent AMR. Explaining the implications of AMR, Dr P K Julka, senior director of Max Daycare Oncology said: Cancer patients often require antibiotics to treat respiratory infections and other complications. The regular ones meant to treat the condition have stopped working in most cases because the patients have already been overexposed to it. Sometimes it leads to higher morbidity and mortality. The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis is another major fallout of antibiotic resistance. According to WHO, in 2017, around 600,000 TB cases globally were resistant to rifampicin  the most effective first-line drug  and 82% of these people had multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.

HIV+ve woman dies denied permission in hospital,CHANDIGARH: Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations that an HIV positive woman was initially denied admission .,Tnn,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: Haryana health minister Anil Vij on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations that an HIV positive woman was initially denied admission by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, even as the hospital authorities rubbished the charge. The woman, a resident of Sonipat, died at the hospital on Wednesday, days after she was admitted following the intervention of the district child welfare committee and social organisations. I have given the orders for a probe into the matter. The incident will be examined and only after that any action can be taken, Vij told reporters here. The woman had been sitting outside the emergency ward of the hospital since July 10 along with her HIV positive husband and two children, one of whom is also HIV positive. On July 14, her husband passed away, reports said. She was allegedly not given admission to the hospital for the next eight days and she continued to sit outside the hospital, the reports said. She was finally admitted on July 22. The social organisations blamed the alleged delay by the hospital in granting admission to the woman for her death. PGIMS Rohtak director Prof Nitya Nand, however, denied that there was any delay in admitting the woman or any callousness shown towards her. Her husband was brought on July 14 to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre, but the doctors declared him brought dead. The ART centre collected money and arranged for his funeral, Nand told PTI.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, he hosted major fundraisers for former president George H W Bush and other senior Republican lawmakers.Apart from his professional achievements in the field of medicine in the United States, Bothra has been active in working for the poor and sick in India.For about eight weeks each year, Bothra leaves his general surgery practice in Warren and travels to India at his own expenses to work with Indian organisations to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and drug, tobacco and alcohol addiction.He holds regular lecture tours in India to educate professional and lay audiences on health issues. Bothra has worked with the Nargis Dutt Foundation to produce two documentaries, one on AIDS and another on tobacco abuse.The Indian government also lauded him for being instrumental in gifting of sophisticated American medical equipment to Indian hospitals and assisting in the rebuilding of hospitals in Latur, Maharashtra after a severe earthquake.Meanwhile, prosecutors have been unable to pinpoint Bothra's net worth, which could be as high as $35 million.Assistant US Attorney Brandy McMillion noted that Bothra owns a real-estate company that owns 22 properties across Metro Detroit, including $2.8 million worth of condominiums and commercial buildings in downtown Royal Oak Prosecutors are trying to identify whether the properties were purchased with proceeds from the alleged criminal activity. US Attorney Matthew Schneider attended the brief court hearing Tuesday and said his team of prosecutors will meet and decide whether to appeal the bond.Bothra, jailed since last month when he was indicted alongside five others, is accused of fuelling the nation's opioid epidemic, cheating Medicare and subjecting patients to needless, painful back injections.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/indian-origin-doctor-embroiled-in-healthcare-fraud-in-us-freed-on-record-7-million-bond/articleshow/67553638.cms
World has become 'dramatically healthier' in 20 years: Melinda Gates,"US News: ""The world has actually become dramatically healthier in the last 20 years. The story of the past two decades is a story of incredible improvement in",Pti,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The world has become ""dramatically healthier"" in the last 20 years mainly because of the global health funds, top US philanthropist Melinda Gates said Thursday, citing examples of India, Indonesia and Vietnam which moved up the ladder due to their economic growth. The story of the past two decades is a story of incredible improvement in the human condition, Melinda of the 'Bill and Melinda Gates' foundation said during a global conference with reporters along with her husband and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. ""The world has actually become dramatically healthier in the last 20 years. The story of the past two decades is a story of incredible improvement in the human condition. And it's one of the reasons Bill and I call ourselves optimists,"" she said. The poorest parts of the world not only became less poor, they also became much, much healthier, Melinda said. Under-five mortality rates have declined by more than 50 per cent since 1990, which is a dramatic improvement for the lives of the world's poorest and youngest, she said. Responding to questions, Bill said countries like India, Indonesia and Vietnam have moved up the ladder because of the economic growth. As such they will be getting less money from all of these funds. ""But making sure they don't drop any vaccines, that's been very well organised. India, because of its size, has always been treated as kind of a special case by GAVI, but they did roll out rotavirus and they will roll out pneumococcus,"" he said. GAVI, the vaccine alliance, is focused on childhood vaccines. Noting that the global health funds are behind a lot of this progress, Melinda said around the year 2000, the world started investing more in global health, and in particular, in global health institutions that really pooled the world's resources to buy things that would make the people healthier. ""When Bill and I are out travelling, we see this when we talk with families. Deaths due to infectious diseases like HIV, malaria, measles have halved from their 1990 levels, and they've contributed to nearly 100 per cent in the overall decline in mortality in poor countries,"" she said. There are GAVI, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which of course is working to eradicate polio, she said. The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and more recently, the Global Financing Facility, is focused on maternal and child health, Melinda said. Since 1999, the foundation has invested almost USD 10 billion in these global health funds, which represents USD 1 in every five they invest, she said. ""And we, obviously, would not make those investments and continue to make those investments if we didn't see the incredible return that we're getting in the payoff for the world,"" she said. Observing that the data has been really striking about these investments, Melinda said a child born today is twice as likely to survive past the age of five, compared to the year 2000. The human and economic benefits of this are just enormous. ""This incredible return on investment is why we're committed to funding these mechanisms in the future. The next two years is a really critical time for these mechanisms. ""Donors will come together in France in October to replenish the Global Fund, and next year, they'll focus, then, on GAVI after that,"" Melinda said. As such this year in 2019, the Gates couple, she said, will be talking a lot the impact they have seen from these funds to date and the impact they could have over the next 15 years. Bill said all these institutions have made tremendous contribution to global health. These institutions faced lots of problems trying to get the prices down, try to get the supply to be reliable, trying to get out, deliver to some of the toughest places in the world, including extremely rural areas with no infrastructure, including places like Pakistan and Afghanistan, where there are areas where war is taking place, he said. Over the next 18 months, all these institutions are kind of a critical point where the level of distraction by domestic issues or issues that are confined to the rich world do make them somewhat concerned that the great success story here and the need to renew these resources may not get the attention it deserves, he said. The first to go on this is the Global Fund, which just announced the USD 14-billion investment case for its sixth replenishment last week. The actual replenishment will take place in October in France under President Emanuel Macron's leadership, he said. ""We are really excited to see the ambitious plan they have there and hope we can get either close to or get to that number,"" Bill added.

Women’s panel: No aid for HIV patient,"Physical torture of inmates in West Bengal, no medical aid for HIV patient in Odisha and no treatment for mentally-challenged women in Uttar Pradesh",Tnn,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Physical torture of inmates in West Bengal, no medical aid for HIV patient in Odisha and no treatment for mentally-challenged women in Uttar Pradesh were some of the key findings of the womens commission during inspection of shelter homes in these states. The inquiry committee appointed by the National Commission for Women inspected five Swadhar Greh in West Bengal, eight in Odisha, eight in Karnataka and five in Uttar Pradesh. Out of 26 Swadhar Greh, only one is running as per the guidelines of the scheme, according to the report submitted to the NCW by the inspection committee. These rehabilitation centres were either Centre-funded or NGO-run short-stay homes for the sexually abused and destitute. In Uttar Pradesh, mentally-challenged inmates were found living in these homes but there was no sign of any treatment for them, who are rolling on the floor at the time of inspection. In West Bengal, the inmates complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh. Seven of the inmates are mentally-challenged women and the Swadhar Greh is like a congested prison. The building, kitchen and rooms are dirty and unhygienic, the report on the condition of the shelter home in West Bengal said. In Odisha, one inmate with a child, a trafficking case, complained to the committee that she is a HIV patient and the NGO is not providing any medication to her. Though, she wants to go back to her parents, she was forced to stay back in the Greh by the NGO, the report said. Womens commission chairperson Rekha Sharma proposed introduction of a system like uploading the up-to-date data of inmates on the website of women and child development department. pti Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

70-year-old Baruipur woman undergoes eastern India’s first stool transplant,KOLKATA: A 70-year-old woman suffering from severe bouts of diarrhoea has successfully undergone a faecal microbiota transplant (FMT)—also known as st.,,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: A 70-year-old woman suffering from severe bouts of diarrhoea has successfully undergone a faecal microbiota transplant (FMT)also known as stool transplant a procedure performed for the first time in eastern India at the Indian Institute of Liver and Digestive Sciences, Sonarpur. This procedure is done only in a handful of hospitals across the country, including at AIIMS, Delhi. Namita Majumder, a Baruipur resident, was admitted to a local nursing home three months ago, with severe diarrhoea and passing of blood with stool. When a month-long hospitalization yielded no results, her family approached doctors at the Sonarpur institute. My mother would pass blood with stool more than 23 times a day. She had become so weak that we were afraid of losing her, said her son Prasun. At IILDS, doctors diagnosed her with refractory clostridium difficile infection, which is caused by the loss of good bacteria from the intestine. A bacterium called clostridium difficile raids the intestine and triggers ulcers and diarrhoea. We tried treating the patient with the most potent antibiotics, which yielded no results and she continued sinking. So we decided to take up this challenging and innovative procedure called FMT, said Dr Abhjit Chowdhury, secretary, IILDS. The patient recovered enough to go home after three weeks. FMT is a procedure where faecal bacteria from a healthy donor are transplanted into the recipient. Its a viable option when antibiotics failWhen the good organisms in the human guts are overpowered by bad bacterium, it can trigger a range of gastrointestinal ailments. In a stool transplant, the good bacteria from the donor are transplanted into the patient. The transplant was performed on December 20 and Majumder was sent home on January 8, where she is on the path to recovery. The good organisms introduced through FMT overpower the bad organisms in the gut, putting the defence mechanism back on track. This is a viable treatment option when antibiotics fail, as was in case of this patient, said Dr Dipankar Mondal, hepatology, IILDS. For such transplants, a donor is chosen preferably from the patients family. A healthy adult under 60 who does not have infections and communicable diseases like HIV, hepatitis A, B, C and E, and no stool infection, can be the donor. Any hospital with a competent lab and expert doctors can conduct this procedure. Because of the young talented doctors who are deeply into research, we could take up such an innovative procedure in just about one and a half years into starting in-patient services, said Dr Partha Sarathi Mukherjee, executive director of IILD.

22 inmates at Pilibhit district jail test positive for HIV,"PILIBHIT: Less than a year after 24 prisoners at Gorakhpur district jail tested positive for HIV, 22 inmates at Pilibhit district jail have tested pos.",,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"PILIBHIT: Less than a year after 24 prisoners at Gorakhpur district jail tested positive for HIV, 22 inmates at Pilibhit district jail have tested positive to HIV. Pilibhit Jail superintendent Vivek Tripathi confirmed the development which has left the prison department embarrassed. We will have to look into each of the specific case based on date of their admission and the time they were detected positive for HIV, Sharad Kulshrestha, additional inspector general (prison), said. This development comes amid four inmates of the district jail succumbing to various ailments in the past two months. They were shifted to the district hospital in critical conditions. A medical check-up of every jail inmate is done at the time he or she is lodged. However, this medical report does not ascertain the HIV status of the prisoner, additional IG (prison) Kulshrestha said. This makes things difficult for prison officials to ascertain if the inmate was HIV positive before he was lodged in the prison or he was infected inside the premises. After the Gorakhpur incident last year where 24 prison inmates were tested positive for HIV, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had directed the prison department to take immediate preventive measures so that other prisoners do not fall prey to the infection and those were suffering are provided necessary medical treatment. Weight of each inmate is measured periodically and if any alarming decrease in a prisoner's weight is detected he/she is referred to the prison hospital. Inmates detected with HIV positive are registered at anti-retroviral therapy (ATR) centres in district hospitals, Kulshrestha said. In a test conducted at 70 jails of UP till December 2017, a total of 265 were tested positive for HIV. Senior officials, however, claim that 250-odd HIV positive inmates across UP jails is not an alarming figure. With approximately 1 lakh inmates in jails across UP, 265 HIV positive is not an alarming figure. These inmates are immediately registered with ATR centres on diagnosis, the additional IG (prison) said.

Terminal Decline of Goa Tourism,"If the great poet TS Eliot lived in Goa in 2019, he might have written one of his most famous lines differently, “this is the way tourism ends, not wi.",,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"If the great poet TS Eliot lived in Goa in 2019, he might have written one of his most famous lines differently, this is the way tourism ends, not with a bang but a whimper. Less than two decades after the dawn of a new millennium brought unprecedented global attention and sustained international demand for the still-beautiful beaches, serene villages and vibrant composite culture of Indias smallest state, everything lies in shambles under an onslaught that is compounded by state mismanagement and woeful lack of vision. In a few blinks of the eye, much of what was special about Goas tourism brand has been grossly tarnished. All is not lost, but stubborn denial is not helping and this newspaper has continually led reportage about the growing crisis. As reported by this paper, deputy speaker Michael Lobo said last week, Because of this type of tourists (low budget tourists) were not getting quality tourists. The good tourists have gone from Goa. If we dont take corrective steps now, then tourism in Goa will die a slow death On New Years morning there were thousands of discarded liquor and beer bottles on the beach stretch from Candolim to Baga, many of them broken. Because of all those broken bottles one couldnt even walk on the beach with shoes. What kind of tourism is this? Why are we promoting this kind of tourism? These are entirely valid questions by the deputy speaker. For years now, it has been apparent that tourism in Goa has been deteriorating dangerouslyin the absence of governance, enforcement or limits. Much of the industry operates with impunity, emboldening operators to continually push every limit of decency. In this lawless atmosphere, the fields become parking lots, the roadsides are used as kitchens and toilets, garbage gets strewn everywhere, and every kind of illegality flourishes openly. Instead of focusing on the devastating toll being paid by the environment, society and culture, the government crows over highly dubious raw numbers  supposedly nearly 8 million visitors in 2017. This is the way that tourism ends, but it does not have to happen. With political will and stakeholder solidarity, recovery is entirely possible. If the administration simply implemented the existing laws and regulations, the situation would dramatically improve. An all-encompassing tourism policy anticipating future challenges is long overdue. Goas brand must move towards built and environmental heritage, as well as the abiding peace and tolerance that has always been its main attraction. Whatever government investment is available is required to shore up, protect and preserve these crown jewels of the states global appeal. At this crucial juncture for Goa tourism, wise heads and trustworthy hands are required to avert impending doom. But the motley crew in office does not inspire confidence. Even as the coastline groans under unprecedented mountains of festering garbage, they have collectively failed to address beach cleaning. Several ministers have separately decried the degradation caused by current tourism policies, but have failed to walk the talk. Its an inherent contradiction, with immense political capital awaiting the first politician brave enough to break ranks in favour of the genuine interests of the electorate.

Islamabad seeks ex-envoy Hussain Haqqani’s extradition from US,Pakistan News: Pakistan’s government has initiated a process of seeking extradition of its former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani on allegations of embezzlement.,Ians,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"Pakistans government has initiated a process of seeking extradition of its former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani on allegations of embezzlement following its failure to get him through Interpol. Haqqani, who served as ambassador from 2008 to 2011 in US, was removed from office for his alleged role in the Memogate issue. The controversy revolved around a memo seeking help from the Obama administration in the wake of the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden to avert a military takeover in Pakistan. The FIA registered a case for embezzlement of $2 million against Haqqani in March 2018 relating to his tenure as ambassador, expecting that a criminal charge would result in Interpol acting against Haqqani. Interpol turned down the FIA request to issue arrest warrants for Haqqani, who is now based in Washington. The case is now being made the basis for seeking his extradition.

Postmortem performed on body of HIV positive blood donor in TN after HC clarification,"Postmortem was performed on the body of an HIV positive blood donor who died while undergoing treatment in Government Rajaji Hospital here on Sunday,",,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: Postmortem was performed on the body of an HIV positive blood donor who died while undergoing treatment in Government Rajaji Hospital here on Sunday, a few days after consuming poison. Government Rajaji Hospital dean in-charge Dr S Shanmugasundaram said the postmortem had been performed by a team of doctors led by Dr Selvaraj, head of the department of forensic medicine in Madurai Medical College, Dr Juliana, also from the Madurai Medical College, and Dr Arunkumar and Dr R Chandrasekar from Theni Government Medical College Hospital. The postmortem had been videographed, as directed by the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. After postmortem, the body was handed over to his parents. The postmortem, which was supposed to begin by 10am, was stalled after confusion over a high court direction. The postmortem began in the afternoon after high court clarified that two associate professors from Theni Government Medical College Hospital could assist doctors here. The victim's counsel pointed out that both doctors were taken from Theni while the court, on December 31, directed that two assistant professors from either Theni or Sivaganga or Thirunelveli could participate in the postmortem. On Wednesday, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that since the postmortem would be videographed, there need not be any concern and gave a go ahead. Earlier, on December 31, a special hearing was presided by Justice Pugalendhi after the teenagers family moved the high court seeking postmortem of his body by two external doctors under video coverage. The court granted the relief sought by the family and also directed to videograph the postmortem. The teenager died on Sunday morning, a few days after consuming poison. He consumed rat poison on Wednesday. The teenagers family members expressed suspicion over his death as he was a crucial witness in the case. They said the doctors in the Government Rajaji Hospital, where he had been undergoing treatment after his suicide attempt, had hidden details from the family. The teenager, who had been working in a fireworks unit in Sivakasi, donated blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realising that he was HIV infected. This blood was transfused to a 23-year-old pregnant woman on December 3.

The lab, established at Gandhi Medical College (GMC) will be designated as (BSL) Biological Safety Level II, officials say.

We are now being recognized by others as they see us as normal people. Though it will take some more time to change the mindset of the majority, the scraping of Section 377 has started showing its affects, said Rubina, a transgender working with the CSACS as a counsellor. There are 153 such transgenders in the city as recorded under the project of CSACS. The scrapping of the section is benefiting the transgenders as most of them are seeking admission in universities and colleges. They are disclosing their gender by marking against the third option  others, said Sandeep Mittal, deputy director, target interventions, CSACS. Rubina draws a regular salary under the project and goes to the PGI to counsel her community about HIV tests. Soon after the decriminalization of Section 377, I was selected for this project. I got many queries after getting this job as my friends wanted to enhance their education and get a job like I have, said Rubina. The high risk group for HIV include female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgenders and injecting drug users. For the overall reduction in HIV, the experts aim to effect behavioural patterns through raising awareness among the high risk groups. According to the CSACS data for the year 2018 until September, 442 were found to be positive. Also, we see that transgenders are also changing their views about society now. They do not allow anyone to enter their dera unless prior approval is taken from the dera head.

"HIV, TB cases dip among vulnerable sections","Trichy: Despite being considered ‘vulnerable groups’ for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, no new cases have been reported in the recent detection drive cond.",,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"Trichy: Despite being considered vulnerable groups for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, no new cases have been reported in the recent detection drive conducted by the health department at prisons, oldage homes, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and orphanages in the district. As part of the national initiative, the state government in September had launched detection survey- HIV and TB Intervention in Prisons and other closed settings in Tamil Nadu - for people who fall under vulnerable groups for the two diseases. The detection drive started in Trichy on November 19 and got over on December 1. A total of 1,760 people were covered in the drive including 1,195 from the Trichy central prison and special prison for women and 565 people from orphanages, rescue and rehabilitation shelters and old-age homes, that were zeroed in for the programme. Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that all people with symptoms of tuberculosis were tested during the programme. A total of 115 sputum samples were collected. We utilised this opportunity to cover the vulnerable groups and no one tested positive for TB. Early intervention is an absolute must for efficient treatment of TB, she said. Though there were no new TB cases at the prisons, there were a handful of existing TB patients and they were being provided treatment. No existing TB cases were reported in other closed settings and state-run homes. While less prevalence of TB among people detected recently might seem to be positive news, according to health officials, prevalence is still high in Trichy city, Manachanallur, Thuvakudi and Thiruverumbur. So far, this year around 2,800 people were said to have received treatment for treatment in the whole district. On the other hand, all adults among the covered population were made to undergo the HIV/AIDS test. Unlike TB, HIV/ AIDS does not show early symptoms. In some cases, it may take seven to ten years for symptoms to show. Thats why all the adults were tested, District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), S Martin Manivannan said. Though there were no new cases, around seven to 10 HIV/ AIDS patients were inmates at the prisons and none in the other closed settings. Manivannan said that no positive HIV/ AIDS cases was evidence for how much the disease has decreased in Trichy. Compared to the prevalence rate of 1.91% in 2011, the prevalence is just 0.37% now. Detection drives like the recent ones show how much AIDS has been curbed in the district, he said.

‘Important to know your status via HIV test’,AURANGABAD: School and college students participated in a rally themed ‘know your status’ that was conducted by the district civil hospital on Saturda.,,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"AURANGABAD: School and college students participated in a rally themed know your status that was conducted by the district civil hospital on Saturday to mark World AIDS Day. A kilometre long foot march was flagged off in the morning from Kranti Chowk and culminated at Marathwada Sanskrutik Mandal Ground in Khadkeshwar. Deputy director of health services Swapnil Lale, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) dean Kanan Yelikar, district civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni, Maharashtra State Aids Control Society and NGOs working in prevention and control of AIDS participated in the rally. During the rally, participants distributed leaflets raising awareness about AIDS. Students presented street plays to showcase the theme of the rally. Everybody should know their status by getting undergoing a HIV test. This was the message conveyed through the street play, said Kulkarni. Speaking to TOI, Kulkarni said the prevalence of AIDS in Aurangabad district was lesser compared to Ahmednagar and Nashik. There are less than 1% patients with AIDS in Aurangabad. Pilgrim destinations in both the districts were to be blamed for the high prevalence rate of AIDS, he said adding that the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) continued to undertake frequent drives to screen people involved in travelling jobs and expecting mothers. If expecting mothers are tested positive during their pregnancy check-ups, we can prevent the infection from being passed on to the child, said Kulkarni. According to figures provided by DAPCUs Mangesh Gaikwad, 13,057 persons have tested positive for HIV from 2007 to 2018 but the figure has nosedived significantly over the years. Currently, ART centres at GMCH and at Paithan provide treatment to the affected patients. Kulkarni said the district civil hospital would soon open an ART centre.

Controlling HIV a social duty: Minister,"Thiruvananthapuram: Steps to control HIV virus should be seen as a social responsibility, said health minister K K Shailaja.",Tnn,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"Thiruvananthapuram: Steps to control HIV virus should be seen as a social responsibility, said health minister K K Shailaja. We have already initiated a project which will hopefully control the number of HIV patients, said the minister while inaugurating the World Aids Day observance here on Saturday. Referring to a recent report on the Nipah virus outbreak in May-June which differed on the number of deaths due to the infection from the official toll, the minister said there was no confusion. Kerala was the only state which successfully defended the outbreak. Those who have read the medical report on Nipah would clearly understand that statistics presented by the government was accurate. As per the official records, there are only 18 confirmed cases including the index case and 16 deaths. Recently, there was a confusion on the toll following the publication of a research paper in an international journal which also included four probable cases which were not confirmed by tests. Shailaja praised the efforts of the health department who successfully found the virus by the time the second death was reported. We identified the virus and initiated effective countermeasures which proved vital in controlling the outbreak. Patients who showed identical symptoms to the deceased were checked and their blood samples collected. Of the 18, who showed similar symptoms initially, 16 died but we were able to save two people. She further added that there was no point in saying that sending samples prior to confirming the disease would have made significant changes. Even the sample taken from a person, who lost four members to the virus, showed negative. So, saying things wouldve been different if we had sent in the samples earlier is pointless, she argued. MLA V S Sivakumar presided over the ceremony. Aids Control Society project director R Ramesh, district control officer Sindhu and University College principal J Anilkumar also spoke.

Among high-risk categories of patients are migrants, truck drivers and prisoners. Injecting drug users (IDU) account for 3%-4% of total HIV+ patients in the state. An NGO, Chaukhamba, identified 22 IDU cases in Haridwar this year, project director Alok Dangwal said, adding that most cases were found among people from outside the state who fell in the wanderer category. Many IDUs fall prey to wandering sadhus who take drugs. Quite disturbingly, many young girls are taking to drugs due to peer pressure, Dangwal added.

Manipur government for HIV tests before marriage,"IMPHAL: While talking about the challenges faced by AIDS patients, Manipur governor Najma Heptulla on Saturday said people should undergo voluntary HI.",Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"IMPHAL: While talking about the challenges faced by AIDS patients, Manipur governor Najma Heptulla on Saturday said people should undergo voluntary HIV tests before marriage. Heptulla was speaking at an event called Know your HIV status which was organized at the 1st BN Manipur Rifles ground on the occasion of World Aids Day. Undergoing the HIV test is a must as it helps early detection and can pave the way for healthy living. It is the responsibility of the society to take up this fight against the disease, she said. Adding that the fight against AIDS is also societal, economic and political, the governor expressed hope that experts and intellectuals would come up with suggestions which could help generate more awareness. This is not a battle to be fought by health officials and activists, but civil society groups should also come forward, she said. Appreciating the role of NGOs, Heptulla spoke about the need to spread more awareness about the disease. Chief minister N Biren Singh, who was also present on the occasion, said though the prevalence of AIDS is declining in the state, it is still very common in Manipur. The prevalence rate of HIV in Manipur is 1.43% while the rate is 0.022% in the country. Calling for an end of discrimination against AIDS patients, Biren urged NGOs and the people to come forward to take the fight forward. The government aims to ensure that there are no new HIV cases in Manipur by 2024, he added. Health minister L Jayantakumar said only awareness can put an end to the stigma and discrimination against AIDS patients. He called for a collective effort to eradicate the disease from the state.

‘HIV patients fail to follow up on therapy’,PANAJI: The Goa Medical College’s Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) centre has lost over 500 patients registered with it for treatment.,,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: The Goa Medical Colleges Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) centre has lost over 500 patients registered with it for treatment. An official said the centre is facing a major challenge with follow-ups as many avoid the therapy fearing side effects while many others feel that there is no need to take the treatment continuously when they are fit. The biggest fallout of this is that when patients finally turn up with opportunist infections, it is too late to do anything for them. They come to us and beg to be saved from dying. At that stage, we are really helpless, he said. At the centre, patients on therapy are counselled to continue with the treatment regime, as non-adherence has high chances of them developing resistance to drugs. An official said that while drug resistance can occur even among patients, who have been on ART for a long period, skipping the therapy without a consultants advice will also do no good. The ART centre has about 200 cases of first-line failure and about 15 cases of secondline failure. He said when a patient develops resistance to drugs, it complicates matters even for the doctor, adding some patients simply disappear after starting the therapy. To avoid follow-up, they do everything possible to stay away. They change their contact numbers and even residence, he said. The centres staff has now stopped tracing such patients following a directive of the National AIDS Control Organisation. A positive development for the centre is that it no longer needs to send blood samples to JJ Hospital for detecting a viral load of HIV/ AIDs persons. They get samples tested at an independent laboratory in Mumbai and results are received on mail the very next day, while a hard copy is received within a month. This, he said is a major relief for patients developing drug resistance as drugs can be altered without much delay. In the past, he said persons failing to respond to ART had to visit the Mumbai centre to get their drugs but now they can avail it here except those who are on thirdline regime.

Transfusion of HIV positive blood to pregnant TN woman: Donor dies after consuming poison,"An HIV-infected blood donor in Tamil Nadu, who had been hospitalised after consuming poison, died while undergoing treatment in Government Rajaji Hos",,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI: An HIV-infected blood donor in Tamil Nadu, who had been hospitalised after consuming poison, died while undergoing treatment in Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai in the early hours of Sunday. The blood he had donated was transfused to a pregnant woman on December 3. The 19-year-old from a village near Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram district donated his blood to a blood bank in Sivakasi on November 30 without knowing his HIV status. The teenager had been working in a cracker unit in Sivakasi. He donated blood to compensate the blood used for his relative. The blood was transfused to a 23-year-old anaemic pregnant woman in a hospital in Sattur. The teenager came to know about his HIV status on November 8 when he applied for a job abroad. He reconfirmed it with a private lab in Madurai city and approached the blood bank to alert them. However, the blood had been transfused to the pregnant woman by then. The youth consumed poison on Wednesday morning after news spread that the HIV positive blood which he had donated had been transfused to the pregnant woman. He was taken to Ramanathapuram district headquarters hospital, after being referred from a local hospital. Later he was shifted to Government Rajaji Hospital here. Doctors in Rajaji Hospital said he had been treated in an intensive care unit. Though the teenager seemed to have responded to treatment, he died after vomiting blood.

"Health officials hold surprise check at three blood banks in Trichy, find no flaws",A team of officials from the district health department conducted surprise inspections at three blood banks in Trichy on Friday. The officials said th,,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"TRICHY: A team of officials from the district health department conducted surprise inspections at three blood banks in Trichy on Friday. The officials said that during the inspections, they found no flaws in the way the blood banks were operating and that the records didnt have any discrepancies too. In the past one year, around 13 samples of donated blood were tested positive for diseases like syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS and all those were immediately discarded by the respective blood banks. TOI had reported that in the aftermath of the incident, where the blood of an HIV-positive youth was transfused into a pregnant woman at a government hospital in Sattur, there would be widespread inspections at blood banks in Trichy district. The blood banks that were inspected on Friday included two from government hospitals and one private blood bank (Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH), Government Headquarters Hospital in Manapparai and Friends Blood Bank). Joint director of health services Dr S Samsath Begum, who led the inspection, told TOI that the functioning of all the three blood banks was as prescribed and that they had also maintained accurate records. We checked their functioning over the course of the past one year, she added. It has been said that among the donated bloods over the past one year, two samples were detected positive for HIV, 10 for hepatitis B and a case of syphilis. The blood samples had been promptly discarded by the officials. The donors, whose blood samples were detected positive for the diseases, were also given treatments, Dr Begum said. According to the sources, other 10 blood banks would also be inspected over the course of the next few days. The blood bank officials have also been instructed to send their monthly report to the district health department, and Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society, the source said. Meanwhile, citing how few donors came to know that they were infected with certain diseases through blood test, Trichy programme manager of District Aids Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan said that blood donation offers the general public a chance to know about their general health.

Madras high court asks TN govt to file report on transfusion of HIV positive blood to pregnant woman,The Madras high court on Thursday took suo motu cognizance of blatant act of negligence by medical authorities in which HIV positive blood was transfu,,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday took suo motu cognizance of blatant act of negligence by medical authorities in which HIV positive blood was transfused to a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district. A vacation bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha directed the Tamil Nadu health secretary to file a status report on the incident and actions taken. The report should be filed by January 3. On Thursday, when the vacation bench commenced its proceedings, advocates George William and Krishnamoorthy made an urgent mention about the incident and sought the court to take suo motu cognizance of the matter. Acceding their request, the bench initiated the proceeding suo motu and sought a report from the government. On December 3, a woman who visited Sattur Government Hospital for antenatal checks was advised blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days after the procedure, it came to light that the blood transfused to her was HIV positive and was negligently labelled safe by the hospital lab technicians. Originally, the blood was donated by a teenager which was meant to be transfused to his relative. Since the blood was not used, it was sent to be stored in the blood bank. Immediately after the issue was brought to the authorities, three health workers of the blood bank in the government hospital in Sivakasi were placed under suspension for not screening the blood sample and labelling it safe. Further inquiries revealed that the hospital authorities had found that the teenage donor was found affected by HIV in 2016 when he donated blood during a camp in Sattur. The authorities should have informed the donor if the result was HIV positive. But as the teenager was out of town when a counsellor phoned him to inform, he was asked to report to the hospital as early as possible. Unfortunately, the case was not pursued though the donor failed to report to the hospital resulting in the tragedy. On Tuesday, the donor attempted to commit suicide by consuming rat poison as his family struggled to deal with the disaster.

Woman who contracted HIV via blood transfusion to get best treatment,MADURAI: The government has announced that the best medical care will be provided to the pregnant woman who became HIV positive after a blood transfus.,Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The government has announced that the best medical care will be provided to the pregnant woman who became HIV positive after a blood transfusion at the government hospital in Sivakasi. Speaking to reporters in Madurai and Virudhunagar, after carrying out an enquiry at the Sivakasi government hospital, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan said great injustice had been done to the woman and her family. A preliminary inquiry has revealed that it was due to technical error and negligence, and three persons who were found to be responsible initially have been removed from service, he said. He said that he had spoken to the husband of the affected woman, and he had just three requests - one that his wife be given the best medical attention, that she be shifted out of Virudhunagar, and that the state government should ensure that no other person is affected due to such negligence. The woman is expected to give birth by the end of January 2019. Radhakrishnan said a team of doctors, including Dr Shanthi, Dr Natarajan and Dr Ranjith, had been assigned to attend to the woman exclusively and recheck all parameters as per protocol. The man who donated the blood had tested positive for HIV when he came to the Sattur government hospital blood bank in 2016. But, as the Integrated counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) had not informed him about his condition, he donated the blood at the same hospital on November 30. The woman was given the infected blood when she came for an antinatal check and the Sivakasi government hospital found her anaemic. Radhakrishnan said details of blood donation are computerised, and it would be ascertained how this man was not monitored. Three employees - a councillor with the ICTC, a lab technician and another person - who have not been named have been terminated from service. Dr Radhakrishnan said that eight lakh units of blood was donated in Tamil Nadu annually, and it was given to 12 lakh persons, as different components. The blood was screened for five tests - HIV, hepatis B and C, malaria and syphilis. There was no need for the public to panic The Sattur town police on Wednesday registered an FIR against unknown nurses and doctors. The case was registered under the Section 269 of the IPC - negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life - and 338 - causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others. Virudhunagar district superintendent of police M Rajarajan said they will take action against those who are found guilty, based on the report from medical experts. The victim, accompanied by her husband, visited the Sattur police station in the morning to lodge the complaint. The womans husband said higher authorities in the health department had threatened him when he tried lodge a complaint with the police. Meanwhile, the teenager whose HIV positive blood was transfused to a pregnant woman has attempted suicide by consuming poison. He has been rushed to Ramanathapuram government hospital. The 19-year-old from Thirusiluviyapuram village near Kamuthi worked in a fireworks manufacturing unit in Sivakasi. Ever since he was told about his infection he had been depressed.

"Now, death penalty for sex assault on minors","India News: The significance in the changes lies in list of crime situations that fall in this category is that it will, in a first, include a person who takes ad",,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: In what is seen as a stepped up effort to crack down on child abuse, the Union Cabinet on Friday approved a set of changes in the law that will make aggravated penetrative sexual assaults during communal and sectarian violence or in the midst or aftermath of a natural calamity punishable with minimum of 20 years extending upto life imprisonment or even death. The amendments to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, set out a minimum 20 years imprisonment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault which includes assault on a child below 12 years. The significance in the changes adopted by the Cabinet lies in list of crime situations that fall in this category is that it will, in a first, include a person who takes advantage of a child in a situation of natural calamity to commit an sexual assault or causes the death of the victim. Going by the existing list under this provision, the enhanced punishment will apply to crimes committed on a child in communal and sectarian violence, an assault that leaves a child physically incapacitated, mentally ill, affected by HIV, disabled or pregnant. And the punishment may extend to life and even death penalty. The amendments, piloted by the WCD ministry, will now need to go to Parliament to become law. Aggravated penetrative sexual assaults as of now invite a punishment of not less than 10 years that may extend to life along with fine. The enhanced punishment will also apply to any police officer who commits penetrative sexual assault on a child in police station premises, in the course of his duty or otherwise. As per the law members of the armed forces, security forces, public servants and management and staff of jails, remand homes and protection homes guilty of such crimes will be up for the enhanced punishment. Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the amendments are required to deter the rising trend of child sex abuse in the country. On why natural calamity situations have been included, the government has argued that children are often the worst affected by disasters. It is pointed that in the three months following the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, 513 children and women at the risk of being trafficked were intercepted. There were also reports of rape of young girls including a Kedarnath deluge survivor. To check sexual exploitation, administration of hormones to a child to induce sexual maturity to enable sexual activity has been included in the separate aggravated sexual assault category which will invite a jail term upto three years and fine. Possession and circulation of pornographic material involving a child for commericial purpose will invite not less than three years in jail that may extend to five and can go up to seven years if convicted the second time. In the backdrop of a spate of cases of sexual abuse emanating from children homes the aggravated sexual assault cateogry is being amended. The current provision calls for punishment for whoever on the management or on the staff of a jail, remand home commits sexual assault on a child. This will now be amended to include or causes sexual assault by giving or receiving any payment or benefits to the child or to any other person exercising control over the child The amendments approved by the Cabinet will enable gender neutral implemention of the punishment provisions in line with the criminal law amendment Act, 2013, that applies to rape crimes with upto death for cases involving a girl child below 12 years. The changes were a fallout of a public outcry for stricter action after the Kathua and Unnao rape cases where the victims were minors. The governments justification for a change in provision is that media reports and complaints have revealed that children are being subjected to various kinds of sexual abuse and exploitation by making payments to children themselves, parents or guardians, or other people in whose custody the child is kept. In a recent judgement in the matter of Apna Ghar, a shelter home in Haryana, the CBI judge found the woman, who ran the shelter home, her relatives and staff, guilty of such crimes.

They will be allotted one booth in every ward in the Jaipur city. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had declared that 5,000 dairy booths will be opened in the state for the women out of which 1,000 will be in Jaipur city. This will be done to empower women and to raise employment opportunities for them. Along with this, there are even plans to open a single window for licensing in the JMC office as the complaints of the public towards the authorities related to the issue of licensing for dairy booths are rising in number. This plan is made to keep a check on the officials so that problem will not be created for the general public. Jaipur city is divided into eight zones and at present in every zone a junior engineer (JEN) look after the matter but after the implementation of single window, soon two JEN and two clerks will look after the matters of four zones each in the office to be allotted in the JMC. Mayor Ashok Lahoti said, The decision to open a single window is taken to make the licensing scheme more transparent. There is a plan to open 1,000 new dairy booths in the city and new licenses will be given only to the ladies as per the social welfare scheme announced by the chief minister Vasundhara Raje. In all the 91 wards, we have planned to give one dairy booth to the women suffering from AIDS, cancer or is a widow, to help them earn a decent living. To increase the competition in the state regarding the milk sale JMC has even planned to give 100 booths to the Amul dairy which will also be the companys first entry in Rajasthan. The chairman of the licensing committee Mahesh Kalwani told TOI that the proposal for single window for licensing is made to give proper shape to the plans of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. I have met many people who have complained about the red tap-ism and corruption that is rampant during the time of license issuing. Even all the applications do not reach us as the officials send applications of those that fulfils their interests and pockets. When the work will start here then we can check for any discrepancies while issuing the order said that Kalwani.

‘Donor ignoring ICTC summons being probed’,"MADURAI: The claim of the ICTC counsellor that the teenage donor, who was responsible infecting for the pregnant woman from Sattur with the HIV virus,.",Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The claim of the ICTC counsellor that the teenage donor, who was responsible infecting for the pregnant woman from Sattur with the HIV virus, had tested positive for the virus in 2016 and that he had not answered the summons, was under investigation, said the project director of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Organisation (Tansacs) Dr K Senthil Raj. Dr Raj visited the infected woman and the donor at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Thursday after visiting Virudhunagar and said that steps had been taken to ensure that the woman got the best possible treatment, and priority was to ensure that her unborn infant was not affected. On the donors claim that he had not got any call from the counsellor at the Sivakasi government hospital on his HIV positive status after he donated blood in 2016, he said that it was under investigation. All employees of the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) were qualified in their respective fields and were appointed on contract basis which was renewed annually, with no recruitments being made in recent times, he said. The functioning of the centres was foolproof and that was why the longevity of the infected persons had gone up from 30 to 40 years when they were under regular medication. He urged mediapersons to refrain from interacting with the donor, who had claimed that he had attempted to commit suicide because the media was cornering him. Members of the Positive Network people were also interacting with him and his condition had stabilised, he said. Earlier, speaking at Virudhunagar, he said that 464 units of blood from the four blood banks in Virudhunagar district had been secured and re-examined and those from private banks would also be subjected to the same.

"HC, NHRC take suo motu cognizance",The Madras high court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) have taken suo motu cognizance of media reports that a pregnant woman was infec,Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) have taken suo motu cognizance of media reports that a pregnant woman was infected during blood transfusion and the HIV + teenager, who donated the blood, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. On Thursday, when the vacation bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha started hearing, advocate RY George Williams made an urgent mention about the incident and sought the court to take suo motu cognizance of the matter. The judges acceded to the request and directed the Tamil Nadu health secretary to file a status report on the incident and actions taken. The report should be filed by January 3. The NHRC noted that families involved were trying to cope with the trauma even as more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public health care personnel. The commission has issued a notice to the chief secretary calling for a detailed report in the matter including action taken against the guilty and relief/counselling provided to the victims, within four weeks. It has been observed that the contents of the media reports, if true, amount to violation of human rights of the victims and medical negligence. As reported, had proper action been taken by the authorities when the donor was first recognized as a case of HIV+, the mishap could have been avoided. Now both, the donor and the recipient woman are going through trauma, said a press release from NHRC. A nationwide move is required to be taken to examine the procedures so that Right to Life of the innocent people is not violated, the NHRC said.

As reported, had proper action been taken by the authorities when the donor was first recognized as a case of HIV+, the mishap could have been avoided.

Tamil Nadu violates its own policy on blood safety,"CHENNAI: Almost eleven months after the Tamil Nadu government rolled out a policy to ensure safety and availability of blood, its own hospitals are fl.",,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: Almost eleven months after the Tamil Nadu government rolled out a policy to ensure safety and availability of blood, its own hospitals are flouting the norms. The state blood transfusion council announced that asking relatives of patients to donate blood for elective procedures or deliveries will be a punishable offence and lead to temporary closure of the hospital and blood bank. Yet, across the state most public hospitals have been asking relatives of pregnant women and other patients to donate blood as a replacement. This is how on November 30, a 19-year-old person infected with HIV, though he did not know it at that point, ended up donating blood; his relative, a pregnant woman, required a blood transfusion and he donated to replace it. The infected blood was issued to another hospital and given to another woman, who has now tested positive for HIV. When the state announced the policy it said that hospitals like all other service providers should ensure patients and their relatives are not harassed, said Doctors Association for Social Equality general secretary Dr G R Ravindranath. It had asked blood banks to look for safer methods such as periodic blood donation camps. For its own hospitals and primary health centres it had charted out a plan to organise blood donation camps. But that never happened. District collectors and blood safety officers should have ensured they are stocked. Most banks dont even offer blood components, he said. Repeated voluntary blood donation is promoted because risks are lower. The state did not hold massive awareness programmes to encourage repeated voluntary blood donation. Statistics show less than three out of ten donors in the state volunteer to donate repeatedly. The incident has come as a blow to the state health department, which has been ranked second in health by Niti Ayog in the Sustainable Development Goals India baseline report, 2018, with a maternal mortality ratio of 66 compared to the national average of 130. It has one of highest number of government doctors, nurses and midwives per 100,000 population in the country. Yet, it is sad that the state which boasts of being a leader in public health care doesnt have a safe blood policy. When 60% of women deliver at GHs, shouldnt the state stock adequate blood. Why should they rely on replacement blood at all? In this case it was not even a rare blood group. Most labs dont even have standard testing equipment or trained staff, said HIV/AIDS activist K Radhakrishnan. The average consumption of blood in upgraded PHC and community health centres is 60 units a year and taluk hospitals require about 200 units. Most hospitals dont stock adequate blood because the co-ordination between the blood bank officer and the doctors is very poor.

"Government knew donor was HIV+ve in 2016, failed to inform him","MADURAI/CHENNAI:The teenaged donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday .",Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI/CHENNAI:The teenaged donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday as the families struggled to deal with the tragedy and more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public healthcare personnel. The woman has lodged a complaint against unknown doctors and nurses for the transfusion and sought stringent action against them. Her husband, who is a daily-wage labourer, said the family did not want a government job as compensation, only the best medical care for the woman and child, which is expected to be born in January. The government has arranged all facilities at the Madurai government hospital and sacked three employees for the tragic mix-up. But there is evidence to show healthcare officials had at least two chances to prevent the tragedy. One, the donor had been identified as HIV positive two years ago, in 2016, when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur, a town in Virudhunagar district. The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at the government hospital there should have told the youth he had HIV. The counsellor did call him up but he said he was Bangalore and she only told him to report to the centre. Counsellors normally do not break the news over phone. But she did not pursue the case when he did not turn up for two years. Two, blood bank staff could have prevented the catastrophe had they tested the blood he donated on November 30, again at the Sattur GH. HIV issue: State asks six-member committee to file report in a weekThe lab technician labelled it safe and a woman and her unborn child are paying for his negligence. The teenager had donated blood because a relative of his needed it at the hospital. Since it was not used it was sent to the blood bank. It was issued to a woman at the Sivakasi GH on December 3. The woman, a B.Com graduate, had come to the GH for antenatal checks. Doctors told her she had to undergo blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days later, a private hospital in Madurai tested the donor positive for HIV and referred him to Sattur GH.He had gone to the private hospital because blood tests were mandatory for an employment visa. On inquiry, the counsellor at Sattur GH identified him. She called the blood bank to alert them. By then the blood was issued, an official said. Early on Wednesday, the distraught donor consumed rat poison and was hospitalized in Ramanathapuram district. The infected woman will be provided treatment at the Madurai government hospital, where three doctors have been detailed to take care of her, said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. The state has asked a six-member committee headed by additional director of medical services Dr.S Madhavi to inquire into the case and submit a report within one week.

International Women's Day 2018: HIV+ woman who’s spreading positivity,SURAT: Her life had many twists and turns as she had to pass from the toughest struggle for inclusion and acceptance after facing discrimination in so.,Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"SURAT: Her life had many twists and turns as she had to pass from the toughest struggle for inclusion and acceptance after facing discrimination in society when she was detected with HIV in 1997. At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country. Meet Daxa Patel, who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift. When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life, says 42-year-old Daxa. Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected. It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/ID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003. The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc. We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat, she said. Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat governments social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls. GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and wont have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level.

Help starts pouring in for HIV-positive youths,KOLKATA: At least three house owners in the city offered to rent out portions of their houses and several others offered donation to 10 HIV-positive t.,,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: At least three house owners in the city offered to rent out portions of their houses and several others offered donation to 10 HIV-positive teenagers  in pursuit of their entrepreneurial dream  on Monday, a day after TOI reported how scores of property owners refused to offer a space on rent to them to run a caf once they learnt about their physical condition. I have been receiving calls and emails since morning from several Good Samaritans in the city who are willing to offer space. After months of rejection, this feels like a whiff of fresh air and finally, it feels like the youths can dream big. We have lined up appointments to see the spaces over this week and hopefully, we can finalise a place by the end of this month, said Kallol Ghosh, the founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for the HIV-positive youths at Narendrapur. TOI had reported on Monday that the group of 6 young boys and 4 girls have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail-making and aspired to start their own coffee shop named Caf Positive. However, months of making rounds of several properties in some of the prominent locations in south Kolkata  like Lake Road, Dover Lane, Hindusthan Park, Gol Park and Ballygunge  yielded no result. The moment the house owners came to know about the medical condition of the youths, they started distancing them from the project and refused to offer the space on rent citing problems to be caused by the neighbourhood and family. Everywhere, we were turned down and at one point of time, we felt like our dream can never come true. But then, things started to change from Monday morning. Our teachers at the Home have said several people are calling us up to offer space on rent. This news itself is special for us, said Sathi Biswas (name changed), a Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies. As per the plan, the youths want to set up a caf on a 750 square feet ground floor space. The food and beverages will be served on disposable plates and there would be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding or cut injuries. There will be a corner in the caf where people can even make their own coffee. We will also have a space where people can make their own food items and sell it from our outlet by paying us a portion of the sales. There will also be regular gigs and space for budding musicians in the city. And of course, there will be posters and tent cards, making people aware of the disease and the myths surrounding it, said Sanmit Das (name changed), another Class XII student. Among the many who have offered space to them is a woman from Salt Lake and two from south and north Kolkata. The lady from Salt Lake has asked us to go immediately and see her space. Another house owner has even promised us to offer the space at a discount. But we have said that we do not want any concession, said Ghosh. Another city-based doctor, Anindya Kar, has mentioned the youths as young warriors in a mail to the NGO and has offered them necessary donations to fund the project.

US Senate passes bill to avert shutdown,US News: WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas.,Pti,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas after President Donald Trump backed away from his demand for money for a border wall with Mexico. Senators on Wednesday passed the measure, which would keep government running to 8 February. The House of Representatives needs to pass similar bill to avoid a government shutdown this weekend. House, in which the Republicans currently has a majority, is expected to pass the bill, but unlikely to include funding for the border wall. Unless the issue is resolved, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas. Democratic Leader and Speaker-designate, Nancy Pelosi, said her party would support the bill to avert government shutdown. The House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the President Donald Trump to sign it into law. Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with top congressional Democratic leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to shut down part of the government in service of forcing Congress to give him the full $5 billion he wants for a border wall. The administration appeared to soften its stance on Tuesday when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News, ""At the end of the day we don't want to shut down the government."" The border wall was central to Trump's presidential campaign. ""The American people know the president's wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters  certainly not worth a government shutdown,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, said. ""It's good that Republicans in the Senate finally realised that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country,"" Schumer said. ""It is unfortunate that Trump's demand for a border wall from sea to shining sea has held up seven appropriations bills that have been debated and passed out of committee on a bipartisan basis,"" said Senator Dick Durbin.

'HIV is a sin that needs to be tackled by God's rule',AIZAWL: Mizoram has the highest prevalence of HIV among adults in the country.,,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"AIZAWL: Mizoram has the highest prevalence of HIV among adults in the country. But the Zoram Thar or New Mizoram, a spiritual group fielding candidates for the Mizoram polls headed by evangelist-turned politician Reverend Zaichhawna Hlawndo has a different take on the problem and its solution. Hlawndo said that the problem of HIV in Mizoram is a sin that can only be tackled when Gods rule is established. ""I am telling people that when people disobey God, they commit sins. You and I can do nothing to tackle the problem of HIV. But only God can eliminate the menace of HIV. For this to happen, our duty is to make sure that people who will rule are godly men and women, said Hlawndo, who returned from UK in 2017 and joined the electoral fray as a 'divine call'. He added that the path of evils brings down the afflictions like HIV. According to National AIDS Control Organisations 2017 estimation, Mizoram at 2.04 per cent has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the country, followed by Manipur (1.43 per cent) and Nagaland (1.15 per cent). At the national level, the prevalence rate is 0.22 per cent and it is said to be declining. Mizorams population is about 11 lakh and about 18,081 were found to be HIV positive between October 1990 and August this year. In Mizoram, the trend of HIV positive cases is on the rise. ""Therefore if we have to make things right, our minds and hearts have to be right. I mean we have to shun the path of evil and embrace the path of God,"" Hlawndo said, adding that his party is for bringing in moral transformation, rather than material reforms. Hlawndos party has fielded 24 candidates for the 40-member assembly polls on November 28. Hlawndo is contesting from two seats--- in Serchhip he is pitted against chief minister Lal Thanhawla and in Aizawl West-I. He prefers to call his party candidates including himself as 'apostles' of ""moral transformation"" for Mizoram. Among the 24 candidates who are contesting as Independents, there are three women, including Hlawndo's two daughters. In his meetings, Hlawndo says his part's intention is not to be the rulers, but servants of God. ""God is going to make the nation. We will serve as his servants,"" he said. As an evangelist, Hlawndo has a strong followers in the Christian-majority state. If Hlawndo has the theological solution to the problem of HIV, the ruling Congress and the opposition Mizo National Front (MNF) have virtually failed to make it a major health issue in the current election. ""Our manifesto focuses on the health issues in a comprehensive way which also includes HIV. If we come to power, the problem of HIV will be dealt with in an effective way,"" Congress spokesperson, Lallian Chhunga said. MNF chief and party's chief ministerial candidate, Zoramthanga said it was Congress governments failure to check the spread of HIV. ""HIV issue is a serious one. We will deal with it seriously when we are in power,"" Zoramthanga said.

Ambulance driver’s humane touch,The inability of a woman to pay for an ambulance that brought home her son’s mortal remains nearly two decades ago struck a deep chord with Pune-based.,,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"The inability of a woman to pay for an ambulance that brought home her sons mortal remains nearly two decades ago struck a deep chord with Pune-based ambulance driver Sanjay Shankar Jagtap. He launched a trust called Shuddhidhan Pratishtan in an endeavour to provide free ambulance services to the needy. Over the last 18 years as an ambulance driver, Jagtap has gone out of his way to help many old, ailing and abandoned persons go back to their families and helped police transport accident victims to hospitals. He has played a key role in reuniting nearly 70 abandoned patients with their families, sometimes resorting to threatening the families to take them back. Along with his friend Mahadev Kishanrao Pol, Jagtap has earned thousands of blessings by his small gestures. I used to work as a mason till 2001 when my brother, who was an ambulance driver, unable to earn enough, drank poison. I saved him and then started driving the ambulance myself. Soon after, I took over the ambulance, I was informed about a boy who had drowned in Katraj Lake. The police and fire-brigade recovered the body and I took it to Sassoon General Hospital for a postmortem and then to his home. His mother did not have money to pay me for the ambulance services. It moved me so much that I launched my trust for people who cannot pay for these services. According to Jagtap, while working at Sassoon hospital, he came across social worker MB Shelke. Shelke told me about abandoned patients. He said he would bear the diesel costs if I started locating the homes of the abandoned patients and ensured that they reached home. I started helping these patients. I have come across several cases wherein patients were abandoned by their families and some cases wherein the patient was assumed dead, he said. Jagtap can never forget Haribhau Khutwad. He was from Dapoli and we drove down there and roamed around the town for an entire day in search of his residence. We found out that he had provided us with the wrong address. We were able to identify the house where his son stayed with his in-laws. On reaching the house, the son told us that he will give us the address of their native village where Khutwad should be dropped. On enquiry, I found out that there was no one to support him at his native village. I then threatened his son with a police complaint if he abandoned his father. That was when the son took him back, Jagtap said. He also remembered an AIDS patient, Hirabai Chorge, who was brought to Sassoon Hospital some years ago after people found her unconscious at Alandi. She underwent treatment and asked to be taken to her sisters house. On reaching the sisters house, she refused to take her, saying that Chorge was survived by her son, daughter and mother-in-law. We reached the house to find it locked and understood that the son had taken her to Alandi and abandoned her there. I spoke to the local boys in the area, who had been informed that Chorge was living in an old-age home. I told them what the son had done, after which the friends m and ensured he was taken y the family. Jagtap said e has come cross instances when amilies do not want to ven sit with e mortal reins in the ulance. remember e was a dengue outbreak in the city and a patient had died. The family did not want to step into the ambulance. I had to carry the body to the ambulance and drive it to the crematorium by myself while the family members came in their private cars. In another incident of murder, the body was lying in the ambulance for 14 days before I drove it to Baramati for the last rites, he stated. According to Jagtap, he has received letters of appreciation from hospitals and individuals who have been helped by Shuddhidhan Pratishtan. I provide free ambulance services throughout Ganeshotsav. I had accompanied a team from Bharati Vidyapeeth to Sangli when it was struck by floods. I used to transport differentlyabled persons to Tarachand Hospital in Rasta Peth for two years when they had a special camp going on, he explained. Jagtap said he plans to work for the needy as long as possible. ""My son recently started working in a bank and my other child is studying at MIT. While they have got on with their lives, I plan to continue driving the ambulance and my work under the Shuddhidhan Pratishthan for as long as I live,"" he added.

"Prison inmates to be screened for HIV, TB",TRICHY: The prison department has decided to screen all prison inmates for HIV and tuberculosis and has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) wit.,Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"TRICHY: The prison department has decided to screen all prison inmates for HIV and tuberculosis and has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with social welfare department and the Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society as part of the national programme. In Trichy, the initiative will cover Trichy Central Prison, Special Prison for Women and nine sub-jails under the control of the central prison. Officials from the health department said that though the prevalence of HIV and TB is not high among inmates in the prisons in Trichy, since they are considered to be a special group and vulnerable to diseases, the initiative would check the spread of the diseases. Sources from the department said that around six inmates in Trichy prisons are HIV positive, while around five have TB. Such prisoners are put-up in separate cell blocks. While there are 1,263 inmates in central prison currently, around 70 are in special prison for women and 75 in sub-jails. Three medical officers are deputed to central prison and two for womens prison, while doctors from the respective primary health centres inspect the inmates in sub-jails. Trichy programme manager of district aids prevention and control unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan, said that the main goal behind the initiative is to spread awareness about HIV and TB among prisoners and curb the spread of diseases within the prison and after their release. We would give sensitisation programmes to inmates on possibilities on spread of HIV. Apart from this, tests would be done for those with HIV symptoms so that they are given timely treatment, he said. Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that sputum samples of all the inmates with TB symptoms would be collected over the next few days and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) would be performed to detect TB.

Officials at Patna meteorological centre attributed the expected plunge in temperature to westerly winds. Westerly wind started blowing in the region from Friday morning and its speed also increased from 18 to around 28km/hr. The windy conditions will lead to plunge in temperature, said an official at Patna meteorological centre. The lowest minimum temperature in the state on Friday was recorded at Sabour at 8.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in Patna, on the other hand, was 12.2 degrees C, which was a notch higher than the corresponding normal.

Transsexual artists showcase their talents,"COIMBATORE: At four, Daniel discovered he didn’t fit into the gender that people identified him by birth.",Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"COIMBATORE: At four, Daniel discovered he didnt fit into the gender that people identified him by birth. While he dressed like a boy, he felt as a girl inside. When he told his parents about it, they thought it was a passing phase. But he knew it was not. More than four decades later, though he is today married to a woman and has fathered a daughter, Daniel publicly identifies himself as Celia Deniels, a woman, and dresses as one. My wife and daughter accept me as I am, she says. On Monday, Celia, who lives and works in the USA, performed English and Tamil songs to a small gathering. Just like Celia, almost a dozen other transwomen shared their life stories and exhibited their artistic talents at an event titled Trans Talents Rendezvous that was organised by Sahodari Foundation in the city. The event also marked the 10th anniversary of the foundation, which was started by transgender artist and activist Kalki Subramaniam to help change the lives transgender people. Sahodari was born in pain, says Kalki. I was angry on seeing the way people from the transgender community were being treated. A transgender friend of mine was raped in front of my eyes and she died of HIV. So, I started Sahodari 10 years ago to work for the welfare of transgender people. Through the foundation, a group of transgender people made a set of short films in 2009, depicting their lives. The movies were widely viewed. The videos also helped to campaign for the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in the legal battle to scrap Section 377, Kalki says. Through the foundation, she has sensitized several school and college students. The event saw dance and music performances, plays and a discussion between Kalki and transgender writer and activist Revathi. Bara Bobby, a transgender engineering graduate, who is also a trained bharatanatyam dancer, performed a dance, while Soundarya, Sabitha and Vineetha, all from the transgender community, performed a group dance. Art is a potent way to claim ones rights, say the artistes. While there are several art festivals organised by the state, transgender people are not represented in them. But today we have created several avenues to showcase our talents, says Revathi. Kalki expressed a similar view. Art is both entertaining and educating. So, its a powerful tool to express ourselves.

"In 2018’s first trimester, 1 HIV+ person detected per day","PANAJI: Ninety-two people tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Goa in the first three months of 2018, translating into one ca.",,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Ninety-two people tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Goa in the first three months of 2018, translating into one case being detected each day. This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when over two HIV+ cases were recorded per day. While men constituted 60% of the total number of HIV+ cases in the first trimester of this year, no transgenders and transsexuals were detected with the condition for the second year in a row. Mormugao continued to be the taluka with the highest number of HIV+ cases (27%), while Salcete came in second at 16%. Bardez, the taluka that had in the past years reported the second-highest and, sometimes, highest number of HIV+ cases in the state, accounted for only six of the total cases in the first three months of 2018. No new cases were reported from Sattari, Sanguem and Canacona. The predominant mode of transmission of HIV has continued to be the sexual route, with over 90% of such cases reported. Transmission modes involving infected syringes, needles, blood and blood products have been negligible in the state. Although five deaths due to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in January and February this year, chief medical officer of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Chandrakant Parab, said the launch of the test and treat policy last April is expected to reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths further. Under the policy, anyone diagnosed as an HIV+ patient is put on antiretroviral therapy (ART), irrespective of the clinical stage or CD4 counta snapshot of how the patients immune system is functioning. In the past, ART, which suppresses the activity of the HIV retrovirus, was recommended only in cases where it was considered necessary. Since the implementation of the test and treat policy, more than 370 HIV+ persons have been put on ART in a phased manner in the state. ART, which can slow down the rate at which HIV weakens the immune system, is now administered to everybody: Men, women, adolescents and children, Parab said, pointing out that the move is expected to keep their immune system strong and healthy and improve their longevity and quality of life. Parab said the elimination of stigma is vital to ensure that people who have the slightest doubt of their status voluntarily come forward to get tested and seek treatment. Those indulging in risky behaviour must also protect themselves, as HIV is 100% preventable, he added.

2 rescued girls to SEAL it with a kiss at weddings this weekend,"NAVI MUMBAI: After a slew of celebrity weddings, two in rural Panvel will be ‘SEALed’ with a kiss this weekend.",Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"NAVI MUMBAI: After a slew of celebrity weddings, two in rural Panvel will be SEALed with a kiss this weekend. Two women rescued from the streets of Mumbai 18 years ago will marry their suitors at a shelter home for homeless. Hasiya Philip (23) ran away from home as a six-year-old as she could not bear the beating of her stepmother. She was rescued from Bhandup and sent to SEAL (Social and Evangelical Association for Love) Ashram shelter in Panvel. And Usha Philip (24) had come to Mumbai from Gujarat to search for her sister as a little girl, but got lost at Girgaum Chowpatty. She too was rescued by a social worker and sent to the shelter, where they both grew up together and lived with other inmates. SEAL members said it is a very happy occasion for them as the girls have found grooms through arranged marriage. The brides-to-be told TOI that sometimes they wonder and shudder what their fate would have been had they not been rescued. Therefore, they are grateful at how things have turned out for them. I dont like to remember my childhood, when my stepmom used to beat me up. I dont know which city or town I was in, but I got into several long-distance trains to finally land in Mumbai suburbs. The 18 years at SEAL have been happy, and I am a bit sad to leave this wonderful place to get married. I can never forget SEAL Ashram and Pastor Philip, who is my father now, said Fasiya. SEAL founder, Pastor K M Philip, said, When Fasiya came to us as a child, she had nail injury marks all over her neck. Her stepmom used to grab her by the neck and beat her. Over the years, Fasiya became a good student and a great cook. She also did a beauticians course. It is nothing short of a miracle that she and Usha are settling down by getting married. Fasiya will marry a man who works in Oman and Usha a pastor based in Rajasthan. All children at SEAL call Pastor Philip and his wife Shibi papa and mommy as they have taken care of us over the years. That is why we feel sad to leave this place, but will always stay in touch with our parents and friends here, said Usha. I have seen them grow up from being traumatized, lost girls to elegant ladies who will now have their very own families and homes to look after. I thank the Lord for making us do and see such good things. Tomorrow, Fasiya and Usha will help others in distress, as they remember that they too were once blessed by the Almighty and helped to find their feet, said pastor Philip. SEAL, an NGO, works for rescue and rehabilitation of destitute and missing people on railway platforms and streets of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The shelter home has 258 rescued people, mainly HIV/TB patients, mentally challenged, handicapped, visually impaired and fully orphaned. SEAL has reunited 354 with families in India.

"HIV more prevalent in 15-24 age group, data reveals",Data released by the National Family Health Survey reveals that the 0.30% of males in the age group of 15-24 were found to be HIV positive. The data r,,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Data released by the National Family Health Survey reveals that the 0.30% of males in the age group of 15-24 were found to be HIV positive. The data reveals that prevalence of HIV in this group was higher than in the 15-49 age group. Combined data for Gujarat, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli reveals that 0.19% of men in the age group of 15-49 were HIV positive while the number for women in the same age group was 0.18%. The data further reveals that in the age group of 15-54, the number increased to 0.24%. The officials said that in the 15-24 years group, prevalence was more than any other age group. Interestingly, in this age group, no female was found to be HIV positive. The data also reveals that these are the percentage of HIV positive women and men tested by groups of states or Union territories. The data further reveals that of the 0.48% married couples who are HIV positive only 0.04% were couples where both spouses were HIV positive. The data further revealed that 0.22% men were HIV positive with their wives being HIV negative. Similarly, in 0.22% it was the wife who was HIV positive while the husband was not HIV positive. The survey also brought to light the failure of the government to create awareness about HIV. According to the data released, only 69% of men and 43% of women were aware that use of condoms during sex can prevent HIV. Among men, Gujarat ranked 10 from the bottom when it came to knowledge of condoms and women were the fourth worst, better only than Bihar, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Nagaland. The data reveals the awareness of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV/AIDS was very poor in Gujarat among women, Dadra and Nagar Haveli has the lowest awareness (16%) of MTCT, followed by Bihar (33%) and Gujarat (34%). The data further reveals that only 59% women were aware of HIV, while among 77% men had awareness about HIV. The data further reveals that only 1% of women had high-risk intercourse in 2015-16 while 6.8% of men had high-risk intercourse in same period. Also, only 23.6% women and men knew how to prevent HIV/AIDS and another 20% had comprehensive knowledge. Divyang Oza, the project officer of the AIDS Control Society said that teenage groups are the most affected and the most common mode of infection was sexual transmission. The second strongest mode for HIV transmission is blood transfusion. It also cannot be denied that many couples only use condom for family planning and are unaware that it can be used to prevent HIV. Oza further said that HIV awareness has to be increased, but it is a time-consuming process and while there has been an improvement, it is less than expected.

Morab villagers begin to refill lake with canal water,HUBBALLI: People of Morab in Navalgund taluk of Dharwad district who had refused to drink water from the village’s lake after finding the body of a HI.,,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"HUBBALLI: People of Morab in Navalgund taluk of Dharwad district who had refused to drink water from the villages lake after finding the body of a HIV positive woman in it, completely drained the lake on Tuesday evening. Villagers started the process of refilling the lake with water from the Malaprabha Right canal on Wednesday. The 36-acre Morab lake is one of the biggest lakes in district and is the only source of drinking water for the villagers. It is said that the woman had committed suicide by jumping into the lake last week and her body was found on November 29. Villagers stopped drinking water from the lake from that day itself, fearing that the water was contaminated. Morab gram panchayat member Laxman Patil told TOI that the lake was the only source of drinking water, villagers had refused to drink the water and had demanded authorities to drain the lake and fill it with fresh water. The authorities buckled under pressure and started draining the lake last week. We deployed four motors and 20 six-inch pipes to pump out water from the lake on November 30. We took nearly 10 days to completely empty the lake, said Patil. Basavaraj Melavanki, GP water man of Morab said, Villagers are still fetching water from Malaprabha right canal by trekking 1-2 km daily. They have remained adamant and have not even touched the lake water. More than 50 persons were involved in the task of pumping out water from the lake. On Tuesday evening we completely emptied the lake and started the process of refilling it on Wednesday morning. We had discharged the water to a nearby stream. Some villagers used this water for their fields. Now, water is flowing into the lake from the Malaprabha right canal and it will take about 5-6 days to refill it, added Melavanki. Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said, When all our efforts to convince the villagers about using the lake water went in vain, we extended our full support to the villagers to drain the lake. Once the lake is filled in a few days, villagers can start consuming the like before. Villagers have now appealed to the GP and taluk administration to depute one or two security guards at the lake to prevent people from jumping in to the water to commit suicide and contaminate the water. MLA Shankar Patil Munenkoppa has already demanded the district administration to deploy security guards at Morab lake and other waterbodies in the district to avoid a similar situation, during a recent drought review meeting in Hubballi.

"Jail authorities, ART centre pass the buck","Ludhiana: Two days after the death of an HIV-positive prisoner, the Ludhiana Central Jail authorities and Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre are pla.",,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"Ludhiana: Two days after the death of an HIV-positive prisoner, the Ludhiana Central Jail authorities and Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) Centre are playing blame game over treatment to the virus-infected inmates. The jail authorities said over the past one year, the centre did not get any of the HIV-positive inmates tested to start their treatment. As a result, they were not taking any medicines. The centre project officer, on the other hand, claimed that they were getting tests conducted as well as providing medicines to inmates free of cost. A 38-year-old HIV-positive prisoner had died at civil hospital in Old City on December 9, a day after his admission. Jail officials said besides being HIV positive, the deceased prisoner had tuberculosis and Hepatitis C, too. While his family claimed that he did not get proper treatment in the prison, jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said they did everything they could. There are 130 HIV-positive prisoners in Ludhiana Central Jail. Of these, 127 are waiting for their CD4 test from the past one year, said Boparai. For being administered medicines, the patients have to undergo the CD4 test. It measures the number of CD4 cells in the blood, and the immunity of the patient. With the help of this test, the doctor decides the treatment course. Anti-retroviral therapy centres, which come under National Aids Control Organisation, conduct this test and provide medicines free of cost. The centre project officer, Dr Simran Wander, said, The jail authorities claims are baseless. Representatives of an NGO associated with the centre are deployed in the jail laboratory. They keep a record of the virus-infected patients and regularly get all tests conducted to ensure timely treatment of inmates. Boparai, however, said, Only two employees of the NGO sit in the laboratory and keep the medical record. Apart from that, they do nothing. No treatment is being provided to the 127 prisoners. The three others are paying for medicines from their own pockets. First, it is the responsibility of the jail to get inmates tests conducted and start their treatment. If it is short of funds, then the centre has to step in for HIV-positive patients, he added.

Lack of funds restricting MSM project,"NAGPUR: Men Having Sex With Men (MSM), a targeted intervention project started in Nagpur in 2008 and supported by Maharashtra State AIDS Control Socie.",,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: Men Having Sex With Men (MSM), a targeted intervention project started in Nagpur in 2008 and supported by Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, has reached 1,500 population of MSM and transgenders. The actual count of such people in the city is five times higher, but the project has been restricted due to lack of funds, said project director Anand Chandrani. Earlier, funds used to be available for advocacy and awareness through government supported by international organizations. However, other organizations have withdrawn, and the burden has shifted to the government, which anyway has minimal budget for health, Chandrani said. Hence, no survey or studies are being conducted despite the need for separate counselling projects for gay, transgenders and bisexuals as all of them have different needs, he said. The number of MSMs on gay dating sites and social networking platforms is huge. Earlier, such men were found in cozying spots such as Kasturchand Park. We had identified 30 spots in Nagpur where the community used to come and meet for either hookups, friendships, time pass or sexual encounters. We used to distribute condoms, refer them to doctors and recommend them for HIV testing. However, such spots are drying up because of hooligans, police, stigma and erstwhile section 377, he said. In Nagpur, the project has been divided area-wise into two groups since the past three years and has been handed over to Sarathi trust and Mumbais Gaurav Trust. Sarathi looks after Sitabuldi, Gandhibagh and east Nagpur areas, whereas Kasturchand Park and areas of west Nagpur come under the purview of Gaurav Trust, said Chandrani, founder of Sarathi trust. Awareness regarding HIV/AIDS, condom distribution, screening and counselling for men who have sex with men is the agenda of this project. It includes gays, bisexuals and transgenders, and Sarathi has found 89 HIV positive cases from cases registered under them. We have identified 1,450 MSMs and 50 transgenders under this project. Previously, under a project called Pehchan supported by Global Fund, we had registered 2,500 people. After it was over, we requested MSACS to transfer these people to MSM project so that services can be continued, but due to unavailability of budget, we have not been able to do it, said Chandrani. Presently, MSM project has been allotted five outreach workers, 1 accountant, 1 officer, 1 project manager and a counsellor along with part-time peer educators. If we increase the target, we will need double staff and double salary, said Chandrani, adding that the annual budget for the project is Rs25 lakh.

'Every fourth sexually active person in UP has not heard of HIV-AIDS',LUCKNOW: Over 27% men and women in the 15-49 years age group have not even heard about HIV-AIDS.,,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"LUCKNOW: Over 27% men and women in the 15-49 years age group have not even heard about HIV-AIDS. This means that every fourth person in the largely sexually active age group in the state have not heard about. The fact, noted in the recently released fourth National Family Health Survey report, explains why incidents like the one in Unnao can take place in the state. To recall, over 50 persons belonging to a couple of villages in Unnao's Bangarmau area tested positive to HIV infection in a period of seven months. While a quack who reportedly administered injection to locals with the same syringe is being blamed for the havoc, theory of the affected persons contracting the infection as a result of unsafe sexual behaviour is not being ruled out. The report also assessed higher risk sex among men and women of UP. Higher-risk sex refers to sexual intercourse with someone who is neither a spouse nor a cohabiting partner. Among those who had sex in the past 12 months, only 1% women and 9% men reported having higher-risk sex during the period. The trend was higher in urban than rural areas. A small proportion of respondents said that they had multiple sex partners in past one year (0.3% of women and 3% of men). Over one-fourth of men (26%) who had higher-risk sex in the past 12 months reported using a condom the last time they had higher-risk sex. One percent of men said they had paid for sex in the past year. Though the numbers are small, 34% men who paid for sexual intercourse in past one year used a condom the last time they paid for sexual intercourse. The report also showed that only 18% women and 26% men in the state have a comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. This means that they know that consistent use of condoms during sex and having just one uninfected committed sex partner can reduce the chance of it . But on an overall scale, 52% women and 26% men were not aware of the importance of use of condoms and commitment. Comprehensive knowledge of HIV-AIDS also entails awareness to the fact that a healthy-looking person can have it and they reject common misconceptions about transmission or prevention of HIV-AIDS. Over 65% women 59% men did not show accepting attitude towards indicators assessing stigma. The indicators were: 'willing to take care of relative with HIV/AIDS', 'would buy vegetables from an HIV positive vendor', 'believe that an HIV positive but healthy school teacher could take classes' and 'would not keep HIV status of their relative as a secret) assessing stigma towards HIV-AIDS.'

Scared villagers drain 36-acre lake after HIV+ woman drowns in it,"Hubballi: The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed.",Basvaraj Kattimani,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"Hubballi: The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed suicide by jumping into it a week ago. Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake  roughly the size of 25 football fields  which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal. The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water. This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake, said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani. Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. ""It's sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water,"" she said. The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water. We found the body in a highly decomposed state, said Muttanna Bhavaikatti, from Morab village. We dont want to consume contaminated water. We are trekking 2-3km to fetch water from the Malaprabha right bank canal that flows through Morab. Pradeep Hanikere, another villager, said the daily hardship was preferable to drinking water from the lake. Do the officials drink bottled water if they find dirt or a speck in it? If they cant, then how can they force us to drink water from the lake where we found the body of a woman, he said. Another villager pointed out, We would have consumed the water if it was the body of a normal person; but the woman died of HIV. There is no other way: The authorities must drain out water and fill it with fresh water to save the lives of villagers. Gram panchayat member Laxman Patil said the villagers refused to see reason, so pipes have been sucking water out for the past four days. We managed to drain out lakhs of litres, and discharged the water in a nearby stream. We still have to drain water from 60% of the lake and need at least five days to empty it, he said. There is another problem, though. The taluk administration wants us to complete the task by December 6. They have warned the Malaprabha right canal will be closed after December 8, so we have to fill the water into lake before that. More than 50 people are involved in pumping out water. We will need 1-2 weeks to empty and fill the lake. Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said: We tried our best to convince people to drink the lake water but they refused outright. We offered to conduct tests to prove that the water is fit to drink. I will talk to officials to allow us to fill the lake from Malaprabha canal till December 20 or 22.

HIV positive cases decline in Vizianagaram: Govt data,"VIZIANAGARAM: There has been a decline in the number of people being affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus in Vizianagaram district, ac.",,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"VIZIANAGARAM: There has been a decline in the number of people being affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus in Vizianagaram district, according to government data. Data for the last 10 years, since Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Centres were opened in Vizianagaram and Parvathipuram divisions clearly indicate the declining trend, while the number of people being screened and tested has gone up three times approximately in the same time period (over the last decade). Talking to TOI, the Vizianagaram AIDS and Leprosy control officer, S Ravi Kumar, pointed out that the number of people testing HIV positive has come down both numerically and percentage wise. We attribute this decrease chiefly to the rise in awareness over the last decade after ART centres were established. A massive public awareness campaign was conducted across the district and target groups were identified, Kumar said. Referring to the data, Kumar said, In 2008, when we began screening and testing people for HIV, out of the 22,672 tested, 1,771, turned to be HIV positive. Nine years later, for the year 2017, a total 73,360 were tested and only 633 turned out to be positive. The percentage of people, who tested positive in 2007 was 7.61% against 0.80% for 2017-2018. Referring to HIV in pregnant women, AIDS control officials noted that 176 out of 29, 562 tested positive for the year 2008-2009, while only 29 out of the 60,686 tested positive last year, bringing the percentage count from close to 1% to less than 0.05%. The officials observed that this downward trend was continuing this year as well. Regarding the provision of treatment to affected people at the ART centres, the officials observed that earlier tablets were dispensed every month, but because of logistical issues, some of the affected were unable to turn up on time. They said that a special multi-dispensation programme was initiated by the National AIDS Control Society and training for the multi-dispensation programme was initiated for the staff members of the two ART centres in the district on Saturday, under the guidance of the DCHS (district community health services) officials.

Karnataka villagers drain lake after HIV+ woman drowns in it,"Morab lake, Karnataka, which is roughly the size of 25 football fields had to be drained by the authorities upon failing to convince the villagers tha",,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"HUBBALLI:The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed suicide by jumping into it a week ago. Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake  roughly the size of 25 football fields  which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal. The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water. This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake, said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads only through body fluids. Outside the human body, the virus cannot survive beyond minutes in air or water. Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. Its sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV-positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water, she said. The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water.

HIV positive Gujarati man working to fight deadly virus,VADODARA: He was in school when he started facing discrimination from his friends and teachers after his photo appeared in newspapers with a Congress .,,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"VADODARA: He was in school when he started facing discrimination from his friends and teachers after his photo appeared in newspapers with a Congress leader. The photo revealed to the world that Chinmay Modi, an alumnus of social work faculty of MS University, was infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Modi and his parents lives changed overnight in 2002 when all three had tested positive for HIV. Born and brought up in Surat, Modi, after the photo was published, had to face a volley of questions not only from his friends and classmates, but also from his teachers. Modis friends used to tell him that they have been instructed by their parents not to meet or talk to him. Modi said some of them even questioned him why he was studying since people living with HIV positive die early. Modi started questioning himself then, but now Modi laughs at the discriminatory treatment meted out to him. I never complained regarding discrimination at home, because there used to be sadness all the time. However, a few years later my parents and I had discussion about it and our relations changed since then, said Modi, who now works with Global Youth Network of People Living with HIV. After finishing his postgraduation from MSU in 2016, Modi became a full-time activist working for people living with HIV positive. He joined National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India and currently works with Global Youth Network of People Living with HIV (Y+ network). Modis job is to prepare teenagers living with HIV positive for treatment. At Y+ network, Modi is entrusted with responsibilities of Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and South Africa.

Centre for excellence in HIV care will be set up by December 2019: Vishwajit Rane,PANAJI: The Goa government will set-up a centre for excellence in HIV care in December 2019.,Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: The Goa government will set-up a centre for excellence in HIV care in December 2019. Health minister Vishwajit Rane made the statement while speaking as chief guest after attending Positive Power Summit 2018 organized by Human Touch, a voluntary organisation on the eve of World AIDS Day on Friday. Listening to various difficulties faced by children suffering from HIV, Rane said that the government will come up with a new policy and grants from the state budget will be provided for various initiatives to create infrastructure so that children afflicted with HIV can live a better quality of life. We, as policy-makers, need to change the narrative. We need to be more sensitive on how to take this issue forward, he added. Project director, Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Jose DSa said that the main goal is to attain zero HIV infection, zero conversion of HIV to AIDS, zero AIDS-related threats and most importantly, to remove discrimination. GSACS, he said, is trying to achieve this goal by 2020. Founder, Human Touch, Peter Borges said that during the last two years in Goa, 610 people have been found infected as HIV positive. He further said HIV is not only transmitted by sex but is transmitted by sexism, poverty and homophobia. If we are going to end the menace of AIDS, we must cure the disease in our heart and minds, he said. The organisation also appealed to stakeholders and the state government to take unprecedented and bold actions to advance efforts to end AIDS in the state by 2030. The summit reported on gaps encountered while implementing interventions with adolescents living with HIV.

Need change of mindset about sex to fight AIDS menace: NGO,"GUWAHATI: Pancharatna, a local NGO working towards eradication of AIDS, was awarded by the state government for their tireless efforts on the occasion.",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Pancharatna, a local NGO working towards eradication of AIDS, was awarded by the state government for their tireless efforts on the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday. Speaking to TOI, the NGO said a change of mindset in talking about sex is necessary to fight the AIDS menace. Since 2008, the NGO has counselled more than 1000 individuals who are MSMs (men who have sex with men) in different locations of Nalbari district. Pancharatna has been bestowed with the responsibility to carry out the Targeted Intervention (TI) project with MSMs and transgenders. Health workers of the NGO have succeeded to persuade 22 MSMs to have health check-ups which detected that they were HIV positive. Fear of being ostracized had been one of the factors that kept the 22 men secretive about their sexual orientation and unable to take preventive measures. Its been a very difficult journey over the last 10 years. People still shy away from discussing sex. And the people who are MSM dont want to speak openly at all. They would always hide. So, it becomes even more difficult to trace them, Mahendra Baishya, chairman of Pancharatna, told TOI. After we notice homosexual behaviour, we engage with them by making friends with the help of our workers with similar feelings towards the same sex. Thats how they become open and then we persuade them for blood tests and the next steps, Baishya added. If anyone is found to be positive, they are immediately sent to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital for further treatment. He said that the age group of these 22 detected positive is from 20 to 35. Many of them are married but they were continuing unsafe MSM activities. This has also introduced threats for their wives and newborns. This is very dangerous, said Baishya. Narrating his experiences of the last decade, Baishya said only 30% change has come. People dont want to discuss sex openly. Until and unless we change this kind of mindset, we will not be able to fight this menace, said Baishya. The most effective means of controlling the spread of HIV in India is through the implementation of Targeted Interventions (TIs) amongst persons most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgenders and injecting drug users. As per the India HIV Estimation 2017 Fact Sheet, it is estimated that Assam has 13,539 people living with the disease. HIV prevalence in Assam is 0.06%, lower than the national average, which is 0.22%. The scenario is not at all pleasant because Assam is vulnerable to new HIV infections mainly because of inflow and outflow of migrants, said Samir Sinha, principal secretary of health and family welfare department.

Mediations help in AIDS fight,Forget preaching pseudo morality.Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preven,Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"KANNUR: Forget preaching pseudo morality. Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preventing spread of AIDS. Most sex workers have now started engaging in sex with a limited number of clients and that too with only those who are personally known to them, according to people working among such communities. NGOs working among sex workers said the clients are also ready to undergo frequent medical check-ups. ""Nowadays, not many of them are seen on the streets. They work during daytime and meet only a limited number of clients who are known to them,"" said Shaji P M, coordinator of Chola, a Kannur-based NGO. Since the sex workers know most of their clients, they make sure that the ones who come to them undergo medical check-ups for HIV and other infections, he said. There are 749 female sex workers in contact with Chola and nearly 80% of them practice such methods, he said, adding there were 12 HIV-infected sex workers here a few years ago but none of them are working in the sex industry now. With the advent of smartphones and social media, the coordination has become easy for them and it has reduced the risk. According to Snehatheeram, another NGO, sexual minorities, including members of the MSM community, have also been following such methods . In the MSM community, there are people from all classes and now most of them indulge in sexual activity with known partners and it has reduced the risk of HIV infection, said an employee of the NGO. Thanks to such interventions initiated by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), with the support of the NGOs, the risk of HIV infection has come down considerably, said Dennis Joseph, joint director of the society. ""The spread of HIV among sex workers has been reduced from 1.75% nearly a decade back to 0.01% now,"" he said. Last year, only four cases of HIV infection were reported among the sex workers in the state, and only two of them were registered with KSACS and two were outsiders, said KSACS. Similar interventions were made among drug users which helped them curb the habit of sharing syringes. Moreover, after realizing that they resort to crime to get money to procure drugs, facility was provided to get them drug, as part of the treatment, he said. As a result, the prevalence of HIV infection rate among drug abusers has come down from 10.5% to 0.41% in the past one decade, said the KSACS joint director.

"Indian banks now target Mallya's Indian Empress superyacht in bid to get back Rs 10,000 crore","UK News: The yacht, which he purchased in 2006 and spent £5 million (about Rs 44.5 crore today) refurbishing in 2015, with a 15-seater cinema, spa and steam ro",,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"LONDON: Indebted tycoon Vijay Mallyas flamboyant lifestyle has taken another hit after a consortium of 13 Indian banks trying to claw back Rs 10,000 crore they are owed by Mallya are now after the proceeds of the sale of his 95-metre superyacht Indian Empress. The yacht, which he purchased in 2006 and spent 5 million (about Rs 44.5 crore today) refurbishing in 2015, with a 15-seater cinema, spa and steam room, beauty salon and gentlemans lounge, is currently impounded and moored at Valletta, Malta. The yacht, which boasts four decks and a massive sundeck for entertaining, is where Mallya held some of the most swanky Formula One parties during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, inviting more than 1,000 guests. Built in 2000 by Dutch yard Oceanco for a member of the Qatari royal family, the yacht, estimated to be worth $93 million (about Rs 648 crore), was abandoned by Mallya in Malta in September 2017, allegedly over unpaid maritime bills. The seafarers union Nautilus International had the vessel arrested by maritime creditors in March 2018 to recover unpaid wages for more than 40 crew, including Indians, owed more than $1 million (Rs 6.97 crore, approximately) in wages. It was sold in September 2018 at a judicial re-auction as part of the arrest proceedings for 35 million (about Rs 277 crore) to Maltese Society Sea Beauty Yachting Limited and has been renamed NEOM. Neom is the name of a new city being built in Saudi Arabia so it is believed the new owner may have links to the Middle East. The vessel, which is registered in the Isle of Man, was abandoned with possessions on board, belonging to both Mallya and his guests, including a grand piano belonging to Elton John and original Picasso and M F Husain paintings. These were part of the auction. Mallya bought the piano, which Elton John had used to write Songs from the West Coast, for 226,000 (about Rs 1.8 crore) at a charity auction in May 2008 in aid of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Barclays Bank is the lead party in the case against the vessel in Maltas civil court first hall, being the main secured creditor, having lent two mortgages in 2008 and 2018 against it, worth just under 25 million (about Rs 198 crore). Law firm TLT LLP in London, which represents the consortium of 13 Indians banks, secured a court order in the commercial court of the London high court this week to help it get a slice of the yachts proceeds. Whilst the banks are not creditors owed money by the yacht, the banks are seeking to secure the net sale proceeds, after the payment of maritime creditors, such as fuel suppliers, who rank in priority. According to the court papers in Malta, which TOI has seen, there are a number of creditors, in addition to Barclays Bank, but the total amount being claimed by all the creditors of the vessel does not exceed 28 million (Rs 221 crore, approximately). The creditors will be paid from the 35 million via a process called a competition of creditors procedure. Since there will be a surplus of monies due back to the yachts owners, the banks are seeking to obtain that surplus in the Maltese courts rather than it being paid back to the yachts previous owner, Mallya. The order, dated November 28, 2018, by Mr Justice Phillips, grants the banks permission to use information provided pursuant to the worldwide freeze order on Mallyas assets they had obtained in November 2017, in respect of the court proceedings in Malta involving Indian Empress.

Struck by the tragedy and worried for his soon-to-be-born child, Sharma's life turned upside-down and he did not know what to do. With a strong determination to lead a normal life, Sharma started Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) treatment with his family's support. Besides, he also set up a shelter home for HIV-positive orphaned children in his hometown Ujjain in 2014. ""I was suffering from some health issues and was diagnosed with liver infection. I decided to go for a thorough medical check-up. The results left me in utter shock. I was more worried about my pregnant wife and the yet-to-be-born child,"" he said while sharing his ordeal with the TOI. ""My mother proved my biggest strength. I went to the National AIDS Control Organisation in Delhi for treatment where I came across a person, who was on ART treatment for last 10 years and was leading a normal life. The meeting gave me a new hope. I got my wife tested. Thankfully, she tested negative and later we also got our son tested who also tested negative. I breathed a sigh of relief and started my medicines,"" said Sharma. Speaking about the stigma faced by HIV-positive persons, Sharma said apart from common people, some doctors too are biased against HIV+ and AIDS patients. ""I fractured my thigh in 2014, but doctors refused to perform surgery when they found out that I was HIV positive. Even pregnant HIV-positive women face difficulties as doctors refuse to perform delivery. This mentality has to be done away with,"" he said. In 2006, Sharma set up Ujjain HIV/AIDS Network People's Society where he works for the welfare of HIV-positive people. ""Many people lose hope of leading a normal life. We come together and help them start ART treatment and also provide them morale support. There is a myth that HIV-positive people cannot get married or have children. We got many HIV-positive people married and with proper treatment their children tested negative which gave them hope,"" he said. Sharma also started working for HIV-positive children after he came across cases where such children had nowhere to go after their parents died and relatives refused to take them in. With the help of a local missionary he established a shelter home for HIV positive orphans in 2014. ""Ours is the only centre for HIV-positive kids in the state. The centre has 36 inmates and we hope many more shelters to come up in MP. The ART is provided to children by the government while the missionary provides them with food and shelter. We have come far from where we started but we still have a long way to go,"" Sharma concluded.

Woman claims husband gave her HIV through saline,"PUNE: A 27-year-old woman from Thergaon lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Thursday alleging that her husband, a homeopath, had administered .",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PUNE: A 27-year-old woman from Thergaon lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Thursday alleging that her husband, a homeopath, had administered her HIV-infected blood through saline to secure a divorce from her besides harassing her for dowry. Senior inspector Satish Mane of the Wakad police said, Medical reports of the woman shows that she has been infected with HIV from January. She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year. The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband, Mane said. He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory, Mane said. Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link. The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. The womans father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband, Mane said. The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce. The husband and his parents have been booked under sections 498A, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. The husband has already filed for divorce in court, Mane said.

AIDS centre struggles to get patients’ kin tested,"PANAJI: For a long time now, the staff at Goa Medical College’s (GMC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre has been struggling to convince HIV/AIDS pat.",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: For a long time now, the staff at Goa Medical Colleges (GMC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre has been struggling to convince HIV/AIDS patients under its care to get their kin tested for the condition. Family members of not even 20% of the 8,000 HIV patients registered with ART have undergone the test. In the last few moths, four children were detected HIV positive after their parents reluctantly agreed to have them checked. An official from Goa state aids control society (GSACS) said, Early detection is very important to control the spread of the virus. The disease is a critical, but manageable one, yet those afflicted keep it a secret, not only from the society, but also from their own family, thus, exposing them to the disease. It is difficult to accept the reality of testing positive. A majority will try and keep their status hidden, said a counsellor who works with persons living with HIV/AIDs. The counsellor recounted about the time a 60-year-old woman from Sattari walked into the centre, complaining of severe headache and continuous body pain. The fragile, distressed woman caught the virus from her husband who died a while ago, the counsellor further said, adding that in many instances, senior citizens infected with the virus are diagnosed late. In another case, a woman tested positive after the death of her husband, who she had contracted the virus from. She was warned to her get son tested, but she never did so. Recently, her 24-year-old son also tested positive and is believed to have been infected via vertical transmission, he said. The numbers of people with of HIV are dropping, but it is a matter of concern that carriers of the virus do not take precautions despite warning. We could do better, only if all co-operate, he said.

"Docs: With preventive tablets handy, youths giving condoms a miss",Doctors are concerned about the rise in risky sexual behaviour among urban youth due to availability of prophylactic tablets which can prevent transmi.,,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"Doctors are concerned about the rise in risky sexual behaviour among urban youth due to availability of prophylactic tablets which can prevent transmission of sexually-transmitted diseases such as HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs are recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for those in relationships with HIV-positive persons or drug-addicts who have shared needles recently. But doctors told TOI at the sidelights of a medical conference in Nagpur that they were increasingly coming across youths having unprotected sex (without condoms) as they have taken PrEP. PrEP consumption has gone up drastically as youths do not want barriers like condoms, infectious diseases specialist Dr J K Maniar, who practices in Mumbai, told TOI. Several doctors at the conference concurred. Infectious diseases specialist doctors told TOI they were wary about PrEPs availability, and the huge potential of abuse. PrEP has been labelled safe, with a new peer-reviewed medical research published in the medical journal The Lancet stating that it has 99% efficacy if taken properly. But PrEP is a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine drugs. Tenofovir is known to affect kidneys and bone density; users have to take regular blood tests to monitor their kidney and bone health. PrEPs efficacy depends on factors such as consumption of alcohol, certain foods and other drugs, said director of infectious diseases at Jaslok Hospital, Dr Om Shrivastav, adding that its not a 100% guarantee against HIV. Dr Shrivastav said he knows 40 patients who despite PrEP have got sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and HIV in the last few years. PrEP is meant for people with high-risk sexual behaviour who are polygamous. It is recommended they use condoms which, incidentally, too, has a 4% chance of transmitting STDs, he added. India has not yet come up with guidelines on PrEP even though WHO approved its use over a year back. We dont want to dilute the focus on the use of condoms to prevent the HIV epidemic, said a senior National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) official. Dr Shrikala Acharya of Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), which works under NACO, said the Centre was estimating the HIV-positive population across major metros to work out PrEP guidelines.

"‘Don’t advertise HIV-positive status, write ‘universal precaution’ instead’","CHANDIGARH: For HIV-positive people to get medical attention without being harassed, health practitioners should put “universal precaution” and not th.",,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: For HIV-positive people to get medical attention without being harassed, health practitioners should put universal precaution and not their HIV status on medical cards, says Puja Thakur, HIV-positive activist for the cause. At a TOI event related to the national girl child campaign, she talked about the harassment that the HIV-positive people face in hospitals where they go in search of medication. She said: My husband refused to go to hospital because laboratory technicians would ask him awkward questions like whether he had any extra-marital affair. The law says the HIV-positive status is not to be disclosed, so why is on the pateints medical cards? She pointed out that the medical term for HIV-positive is universal precaution, about which only a few people know. She urged the health department to promote the term so that patients are treated with dignity. Disclosure of their HIV-positive status renders patients vulnerable to harassment at the hands of chemists, who pry into their medical history and personal life. No school is ready to accept her children. Local MP Kirron Kher found it strange that doctors were writing the HIV-positive status on medical cards. She underlined the need to spread awareness about the way the HIV-positive people should be treated, and said laboratory techinicians should correct their mindset. I ask people to accept HIV/AIDS as a medical problem like cancer. Poojas life changed after she was screened with this medical issue. Not only her in-laws but also her parents denied her financial help for treatment. Dont go for the treatment, her in-laws said, Society is making fun of us. This after she lost her husband to the disease. An HIV-postive person can live a normal life up to 60, Pooja said. Her in-laws turned her out of the house along with two HIV-postive sons, though they kept her eldest child, who had tested negative. The director of State Aids Control Society supported her treatment and got her life back on track. She now works for the Chandigarh HIV-positive Society. This medical problem gave me a mission of life, Pooja said. To make myself aware of the legal rights of HIV-postitive people, I resumed my education, she said. She was a matriculate when she got married and completed her graduation after family disowned her. She plans to get a masters degree in social work and keep working for the rights of HIV-positive people. During the 2010 IPL season, she was toss ka boss for a match.

Alcohol claimed 30 lakh lives across world in 2016: Nitish Kumar,PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said around 30 lakh people died because of harmful use of alcohol across the globe in 2016.,Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said around 30 lakh people died because of harmful use of alcohol across the globe in 2016. Quoting a recent study by World Health Organisation (WHO), the CM also pointed out that alcohol consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. In the age group of 20-39 years, 13.5% of the total deaths in the world were alcohol-related, Nitish said while addressing a prohibition and excise departments function here. Referring to the WHO report published on September 21 this year, the CM also pointed out that 5.3% of all deaths in the world in 2016 were due to alcohol consumption. The adverse effects of alcohol consumption was greater than those of tuberculosis (2.3%), HIV/AIDS (1.8%), diabetes (2.8%), hypertension (1.6%), digestive diseases (4.5%), road injuries (2.5%) and violence (0.5%) across the world, the CM said. Countering his critics who claim that tourist flow has sharply gone down in Bihar after the enforcement of total prohibition, Nitish said tourist footfall in the state had increased after prohibition and it went above three crore people last year. More than 10 lakh foreign tourists arrived in the state last year, he said. Nitish also pooh-poohed his critics claim that the state had to suffer a huge revenue loss due to the liquor ban. We suffered a revenue loss of Rs 1,000 crore only in the first financial year after enforcement of prohibition. After that, the state government received extra revenue and taxes from other heads as the money saved by people after the liquor ban was used in purchase of other consumer items from the market. In that way, people paid more taxes to the government, the CM said. Praising Nitish for enforcing prohibition in April 2016, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said, It was not a simple decision. It could be implemented because of the courage shown by the CM. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

Condom-less sex popular thanks to pre-exposure drugs: Doctors,NAGPUR: More and more urban youths are chucking out condoms as the market gets flooded with tablets that claim almost 100% protection from sexually tr.,,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: More and more urban youths are chucking out condoms as the market gets flooded with tablets that claim almost 100% protection from sexually transmitted disease (STDs). Some senior medical experts who specialize in STD told TOI that pre-exposure drugs are oral medicines that can be taken just hours before sexual intercourse and are known to provide protection against even the deadliest of diseases. Senior dermatologist Dr JK Maniar, who practices in Mumbai, is one of the leading authorities on HIV/AIDS. He says that the success rate of such drugs is very high. I would say over 99%. So, basically a person can consume this drug and have unprotected sex with an HIV infected person without any medical risk. The consumption of the pre-exposure drugs (PEDs) have gone up drastically as youths do not want any barriers. Some other senior doctors from Mumbai, all of whom have decades of experience in treating STD patients, too agreed that nowadays patients do not want lectures on morality. Dr. Nina Madani, whose patients are mostly from south Mumbai, said, We have to accept that lifestyles have changed and its a different era now. What we want is that youths should be aware and practice safe sex. In fact, I have so many young girls coming to me and seeking medical consultation for their sex life. While strictly respecting the doctor-patient confidentiality norms, all of them did share an overall view of the changing sexual habits of people. Dr RD Kharkar said, It is very common for people to have multiple sexual partners both within and outside of marriage. And patients are very open about it and that is why they are seeking best medical option available to ensure that they are safe even with the lifestyle they live. Dr Maniar said he is also seeing many gay patients who come to seek advice. They want to know the level of risk they have with same sex partners and how to prevent it. Multiple sex partners is becoming a reality and in such situation the priority for a doctor is provide good medical advice and that is what the patient is also looking for, said Mania. Elite sex workers are also increasingly frequenting these top doctors and seeking advice of sexually transmitted infections and diseases. Dr. Madani said, The trend now being of many not preferring a condom means the chances of infections increase drastically. So everyone wants to know what precautions to take when having multiple sex partners.

‘11 blood units found HIV-infected in ’17’,"LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King George’s Medical University (KGMU) were found to be infected .",Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King Georges Medical University (KGMU) were found to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually. The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded. Docs: NAT saved 9k lives by detecting infected blood unitsBut, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected, said Prof Chandra. She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years. There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means, she added. Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method. ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate.

Sudden surge reported in H1N1 cases this month,"However, Figure Still Lower Than That Recorded In 2017",,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"KOCHI: In less than a month, between October 22 and November 18, there has been manifold increase in H1N1 cases in the state. During this period, almost 173 cases were reported from the state, leading to eight deaths. As per the data available with National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the number of swine flu cases in Kerala in 2018, till October 21, was 303. There were 12 deaths during this period. State directorate of health services data shows that the cases as on November 18, is 473, with 154 cases and five deaths in the 18 days of November 2018 alone. But the figure is much lower than the figure in 2017, with 1,414 cases and 76 deaths. H1N1 was first reported in the state in 2009. ""Increase in the incidence of H1N1 is a national phenomenon. The only way people can spread H1N1 is by coughing and sneezing and the best preventive method is to cover the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing,"" said Dr Amar Fettle, State Nodal Officer for H1N1. ""Whenever there is rain, we see an increase in H1N1 cases as the infection spreads real fast with a short incubation period,"" said Dr Rajalakshmi Arjun, consultant, Infectious Diseases, KIMS. Health experts say that this increase is reflected even though there is no routine screening for H1N1. The numbers would be much higher if there was regular screening for everyone who comes with symptoms of H1N1, they said. However, Dr Fettle said it is a fallacy that H1N1 should be tested. ""It is impossible to test millions of people with common cold for H1N1 as symptoms are common. Almost 90% come with common cold and don't need investigation or medicine and can manage with supportive care. Very few come with respiratory distress due to pneumonia and treatment needs to be started immediately and one can't wait for the test results,"" said Dr Fettle. What has doctors worried is that the H1N1 strain is continuously changing and due to this the presently available vaccines for H1N1 is not effective. ""We are not able to the identify the present strain causing the disease that majorly affects the respiratory system. We need a strong virology institute in the state to identify the present strain,"" said Dr R C Sreekumar, chairman (Research), Indian Medical Association, Kerala chapter. ""H1N1 is a common disease. In the early stages, people were encouraged to take preventive medicine as it was a rare disease but now the disease is around us in the community and having preventive medicine is barely of any help, unless the person has some high risk condition,"" added Dr Fettle. People suffering from diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular issues, cancer and HIV among others and pregnant women are the high risk or vulnerable group.

Mystery cases of children testing HIV+ in Tamil Nadu rise,"CHENNAI: In 2017, 236 children below 18 years tested positive for HIV in the state, registering a near 25% decline in two years.",,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: In 2017, 236 children below 18 years tested positive for HIV in the state, registering a near 25% decline in two years. While the number remains a concern for officials, what is worrying them even more is that they could not establish the source of the disease in 32 children, an increase of 10. This has led officials to believe that more children are engaging in highrisk sexual behavior or are victims of abuse. In 2015, of the 311 children who tested positive for HIV/ AIDS in the state, 289 contracted the infection from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. Officials couldnt establish the source of the infection in 22 children. Two years later, the number of parent-to-child transmission dipped along with the number of new cases detected among children, but the number of unaccounted cases touched 32, show data furnished by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society in response to an RTI application by TOI. Officials and doctors say they suspect the mode of transmission of the infection among these children to be sexual as the increase is corroborated by an uptick in the number of children referred to government-run clinics for sexually transmitted infections. The number went up from 6,234 in 2015 to 8,871last year. Recognising the growing prevalence of STIs among children, TANSACS project director K Senthil Raj said he is in talks with the school education secretary to dedicate more space to sex education in the soon-to-be-introduced revamped textbooks. Children could have acquired HIV through transfusion, says officialHe said staff at the integrated counselling and testing centers (ICTC) for HIV usually maintain a record of children with the infection, including those who havent got it from infected mothers. They usually dont probe. But if they do find the reason during the counselling, they maintain it in their notebooks, he said. Some of the children, he said, could have acquired it through blood transfusion or injectable drugs. Consultant psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar, who has worked extensively with injection drug users, rules out this possibility. Heroin and other synthetic injectable opioids were popular till the late 90s. We havent been seeing young heroin addicts in a while, saidDr Kumar.Hisobservation is backed by official data: Of the 1.43 lakh people living withHIVin TNcovered under the central-sponsored prevention programme, 56 are users of injectibles. All are in their 40s and above. Dr Kumar saidthey are,however, seeing other kinds of addictions, including marijuana and alcohol,on the rise among youngsters. It is known that high drug use can make you vulnerable to engaging in high-risksexualbehavior, he noted. HIV specialist Dr S Sundar observed that the state should expand its HIV/AIDS prevention programme to youngsters who arent part of the traditional high-risk group. All our programmes are targeted at the high-risk population like female sex workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men and truck drivers. But ask a counsellor at an ICTC who he or sheseesthe mostitisusually people who are not part of this group, hesaid. Children are engaging in sexual activity belowthelegal ageof consent. It is a fact. They could be in a situation where nobody will even ask for consent, added Sundar. Whatever be the source, once diagnosed, these children are forced to battle the stigma associated with the infection or live in the fear that someone may find out they are positive, said P Manorama, former chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Chennai, who runs an organisation that works with children withHIV. Shesaidshe receives at least one child trafficking victim a year who tests positivefor HIVlinkedto sexualexploitation. Butthey remain mere names in the states medical records.

Zika scare: MP violates blood donation norms,Confusion prevails over guidelines framed to check the spread of Zika infection and blood donation. The Union government’s national blood transfusion,,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"BHOPAL: Confusion prevails over guidelines framed to check the spread of Zika infection and blood donation. The Union governments national blood transfusion council (NBTC) guidelines state to disqualify donation of blood by a Zika-infected person at least for four months. On the other hand, MP is permitting blood donation after four weeks only. The vector-borne disease has spread its tentacles to one more district Hardataking the total number of affected districts to eight. On Thursday, 32 samples were tested out of which three were found positive for Zika fever and all positive cases were from Bhopal. Those, who have been diagnosed for Zika fever, should not be allowed to donate blood for at least one month and those who visited the places affected by Zika should also refrain from blood donation for about two weeks, said MP health department joint director Dr Rakesh Mushi. He said it to be from an MP health department Zika alert circular issued in 2016. NBTCs donor selection, referral guidelines and circular issued on October 2017 directed blood banks across the country not to accept blood from people, who have visited Zika-affected or Zikainfected. It states: In case of Zika infection, defer for four months following recovery. In case of history of travel to endemic Zika virus outbreak zone, the same protocol is followed. Zika virus is a new challenge for blood transfusion, according to a study published in The Lancet. Unlike other vector-borne ailment like dengue and chikungunya, Zika virus can be spread by blood transfusion and sexual intercourse. With over 100 Zika cases already diagnosed in MP, blood transfusion and possible transmission of Zika is a clear and presents threat, said experts. As per the protocol, we do not accept a donor, with a history of fever and other recent sickness, said Gandhi Medical College blood bank in-charge, Dr U M Sharma. The post-surveillance programmes are important to detect Zika virus infections among the blood donors, as surveillance can only detect blood donors with the disease. Currently, a mandatory check for a blood donor does not include Zika infection. Blood donors are checked for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, syphilis and malaria.

50-bed facility for HIV positive people in Bihar,PATNA: The state health department on Friday signed a non-financial memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a Spain based Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF.,,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"PATNA: The state health department on Friday signed a non-financial memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a Spain based Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) to run a 50-bed hospital in Patna for people detected HIV positive. Under its Integrated care of complex opportunistic infectious diseases project, the MSF will set up the facility at Guru Gobind Singh hospital in Patna. The state health department has provided the space for that while the MSF will bear all its logistic and staff cost. The state government will provide only the required policy and administrative support for the smooth functioning of the state-of-the-art facility. There is no dedicated centre in Bihar to provide holistic care (medical, psychological, nutritional and palliative care) for HIV positive people. The immune system in HIV positive people weakens and they are at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs). Bihar government is committed to providing special care for HIV and comorbidity treatment in the state, a health department official said. He said the partnership is expected to develop the capacity to treat immunocompromised people in the state with opportunistic infections. The main purpose of the collaboration is to provide holistic care for severe infectious diseases in immunocompromised conditions.

Children’s home guard not guilty of sodomising HIV+ boy,"NEW DELHI: Terming it a “classic” and “unsolved” mystery, the Delhi high court acquitted a security guard of a children’s home of the charge of repeat.",Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Terming it a classic and unsolved mystery, the Delhi high court acquitted a security guard of a childrens home of the charge of repeatedly sodomising a minor orphan boy who is HIV positive. Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial courts verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a ""travesty of justice"" to convict him of having committed such an unsolved crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial courts finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner. Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge ignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted. In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. The situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved locked room mystery, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court). This is entirely impermissible in law, HC noted. While the child's father was in jail, his mother had died of HIV and, as there was not nobody to look after him, he was sent to the children home for boys.

Tamarind seeds has antiviral properties and can potentially be used to develop antiviral medication for chikungunya,"India News: NEW DELHI: Tamarind seeds has antiviral properties and can potentially be used to develop antiviral medication for chikungunya, finds IIT, Roorkee res.",,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Tamarind seeds has antiviral properties and can potentially be used to develop antiviral medication for chikungunya, finds IIT, Roorkee researchers. During the research, antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%. The findings have recently been published in the Elsevier journal, Virology. The research group at IIT Roorkee has filed a patent for an antiviral composition containing this tamarind antiviral protein. The researchers are now developing tamarind-based therapeutic agents for chikungunya. Alphaviruses cause mild to severe viral diseases in human beings and animals and are usually transmitted by mosquitoes. The chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that causes high fever and severe joint pain. Professors Shailly Tomar and Pravindra Kumar from the Department of Biotechnology, have shown that a protein found in tamarind seeds has antiviral properties. Antiviral drugs and vaccines against most alphaviruses, including chikungunya are still not available in the market, and preventive measures are currently the only route to managing diseases caused by such viruses, said Tomar, on the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics. Chikungunya and other alphaviruses are made of a single strand of RNA that is enveloped in a capsule. The outmost layer of capsule consists of glycoproteins having glycans, a form of sugar. Through these sugar moieties viruses attach to the host cell receptors and enter the cells, causing infections. An antiviral drug that is able to block the interaction of alphaviruses with the host cell and thus should inhibit the virus. In biological systems, antibodies bind to the viral surface glycans (sugar) and glycoproteins and prevent entry of the virus into the host cells. Thus, research on developing antiviral drugs have largely focused on developing sugar-binding molecules that can mimic the action of biological antibodies. Lectin, a diverse group of proteins derived from plant sources, are known to bind to glycan sugars. The use of lectin as antiviral has been extensively studied for a range of viruses, including the HIV and HPV. Tomar and Kumar have shown that a lectin derived from tamarind seeds bind to glycans/ sugar molecules having N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the capsule of viruses, thereby preventing the entry of the virus into the host cells. Chikungunya glycoproteins have NAG, which makes the tamarind-derived lectin a promising agent against this virus. Tamarind is known for various medicinal properties in India and is an excellent Ayurvedic food. The fruits, seeds, leaves and roots bark of the tamarind tree have been used to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dysentery, bacterial infections and parasitic infestations, wounds, constipation and inflammation, said the researchers. They have isolated lectin from tamarind seeds using chromatography and have studied the binding of the lectin molecules to the glycan in the viral capsule by a process called Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%. This study has, for the first time, evaluated the antiviral use of tamarind seed-derived lectin having specificity for NAG and assessed its ability to block the entry step of the virus, said Tomar.

Excise team seizes cancer painkiller,Kochi: The enforcement and anti-narcotic special squad of the excise department on Saturday night arrested a 46-year-old man with 503 ampoules of bupr.,Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"Kochi: The enforcement and anti-narcotic special squad of the excise department on Saturday night arrested a 46-year-old man with 503 ampoules of buprenorphine and 140 Nitrazepam tablets. Gulab (46) of Palluruthy was arrested from Mattancherry. The officers said the ampoules and the tablets were seized from Gulab's house who was living on rent at Goldenmukku, Panayappilly in Thoppumpady. He used to operate from his house and sold the drugs illegally stored at his home even to students. They said he used to inject customers with buprenorphine doses upon payment. Excise sleuths had kept him under surveillance after receiving a tip-off about his activities. Buprenorphine is generally prescribed as a painkiller for cancer patients. However, it's is popularly abused as a narcotic substance as well. Possession of more than one gram of the drug is a crime, said officials. Nitrazepam is a hypnotic drug. The ampules in total contained 1006 grams of buprenorphine. The brand name of the drug was Temgesic, said the officers. Excise officials said the accused even used to inject multiple customers with the drug using the same syringe exposing them to risks of catching other diseases, including HIV. An officer said Gulab brought the drug from outside the state. He added that Gulab himself was on drugs and that a detailed investigation is underway.

"Coordinators for organ retrieval units at Government Medical College, Mayo soon","NAGPUR: The organ retrieval units at Government Medical College, and Mayo Hospital have witnessed only one successful transplant each until now.",,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: The organ retrieval units at Government Medical College, and Mayo Hospital have witnessed only one successful transplant each until now. The procedure for organ retrieval has been marred with many challenges. To overcome them, two individuals from Nagpur will be placed as medical coordinators in both hospitals, and are expected to start duties from the first week of December. These appointments are part of a pilot project launched by Tata Trusts, Mohan Foundation, and the zonal committee to strengthen organ transplantation in government hospitals. Apart from GMC and Mayo Hospital in Nagpur, GMC Aurangabad, BJMC Pune, and VNGMC Solapur are also part of the project. An MoU in this regard was signed over a month ago between Mohan Foundation, Tata Trusts, and the state government. Highlighting a recent study conducted on challenges in organ retrieval, which was reported by TOI in May, director of Mohan Foundation Dr Ravi Wankhede said there is a shortage of ventilators and dedicated staff to follow-up on brain-death cases. The report by Mohan Foundation and Tata Trusts was presented to minister of medical education Girish Mahajan. GMCH dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade concedes that there is a paucity of ventilators in GMCH. Our trauma centre has 23 ventilators and the hospital has a total of 87 ventilators. But we need at least 100 ventilators. Life of a ventilator is only two years. We need 30 new ventilators every year. But last year we received only five for the Trauma Centre, he said. Some patients come from other states, which makes obtaining consent through counselling impossible, since the main stakeholders are absent, he adds. Mayo Hospital forensic department head Dr Makarand Vyawahare said, Mayo has no MRI facility yet, so the patient has to be taken outside for the test. Apnoea test is also a mandatory examination for determining brain-death. After this, counselling of the relatives in required. Talking about other challenges, Mayo anaesthesia head Dr Vaishali Shelgaonkar said, In many cases of brain-death due to accidents, relatives are not aware of the incident. Until the police find the relatives, the organs of the patient start to deteriorate. Organs of a brain-dead patient can be maintained for maximum 72 hours through additional drugs. Despite about seven ideal brain-dead cases at Mayo since it received organ retrieval permission in March, and full facilities in the hospital as per norms, organ retrieval has been done only in one case in July. Illiteracy among relatives and inadequate manpower for counselling and paperwork is another challenge, said Dr Shelgaonkar. Brain-dead patients with cancer, HIV, severe infection or above 60 years of age dont qualify for organ retrieval. Homicidal and poisoning cases also dont qualify as ideal cases for organ retrieval.

HIV positive man gets 10 years in jail for raping stepdaughter,SURAT : A local court convicted a 52-year-old man for raping his minor stepdaughter for six years and sentenced him to 10 years in jail on Saturday.,,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"SURAT : A local court convicted a 52-year-old man for raping his minor stepdaughter for six years and sentenced him to 10 years in jail on Saturday. The convict is HIV-positive and unemployed. He used to rape the girl when her mother went to work. The minor girl has not contracted HIV despite being raped by an infected person from 2008 to 2014 in their house in Sachin area of the city. The convict had divorced his wife to get married to the rape survivors mother. He started raping the girl when she was a student of class VI. The girls mother was forced to work to support the family because the convict was unemployed. She used to do textile- related job work at home and then went out to sell textile products. The womans younger son used to be in school when the convict raped his stepdaughter. He threatened her if she told anyone about it. The girl did not complain to her mother until November 25, 2014 when the convict slapped her alleging that she was having an affair with a man. The girl told her mother that the convict has been raping her since 2008 when she was 10-year-old. The girls mother took help of a social worker and approached police, who after registration of the complaint arrested the man and sent him to jail. The 52-year-old man was convicted for raping his minor stepdaughter and sentenced to 10 years in jail. The convict is an AIDS patient.

"8% of TB patients in Karnataka are HIV positive, third highest in India",The prevalence of HIV positivity among TB patients in Karnataka is the third highest in the country. According to the India Tuberculosis 2018 report r,,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"BENGALURU: The prevalence of HIV positivity among TB patients in Karnataka is the third highest in the country. According to the India Tuberculosis 2018 report released recently, 8% of the TB patients suffer from HIV infection and are aware of the condition. HIV infection increases the risk of progression of latent TB infection to active TB disease, increasing the risk of death if not treated timely, it adds. The highest prevalence of HIV among TB patients has been recorded by Nagaland (14%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (10%). One of the reasons why Karnataka is in the third position is emphasis given to the testing of HIV status of TB patients, say doctors with the state health and family welfare department. When it comes to total TB patients notified in the country, Karnataka is in the 10th position (81,187). Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 3,11,041 cases. When the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is considered, Uttar Pradesh reports only 1%, indicating poor testing. Bagalkot tops list Bagalkot district tops the list of HIV prevalence among TB patients in Karnataka at 30%. It is followed by Belagavi (15%), indicating that TB care needs to be more focused on north Karnataka. Dharwad, Raichur and Udupi have 11% TB patients suffering from HIV. Dr Ramachandra Bairy, joint director, tuberculosis control programme, health and family welfare department, said early detection helps in controlling the infection. In Karnataka, all HIV positive persons are tested for TB during their regular monthly antiretroviral therapy (ART) sessions. Likewise, all TB patients are tested for HIV infection, he said. If people living with HIV have cough that persist for more than two weeks and develop any gland in neck, they are immediately referred for TB testing, he added.

This hideout was a major security glitch considering the fact that hundreds of VIPs and dignitaries pass along the stretch every day. ""The discovery has allowed us to avert one of the biggest law and order and security threats in recent times. We had no clue that some criminals had been hiding under the statue. Criminals could have easily used the space to attack any dignitary, who may have been using the stretch,"" said an officer of Airport police station, who busted the gang on Sunday. On Sunday, a youth in his twenties came running to a group of civic police volunteers on duty at the crossing of VIP Road and Airport Road and complained of being robbed by three men while he was waiting for a bus to reach his home at Barasat. ""The youth was bleeding from his nose and scratch marks on his lips, face and neck. He told us that three men had just dragged him to a tunnel like structure at the middle of the road and robbed his cellphone, wallet and watch. We took him to the spot and were stunned to find a hollow space, large enough to fit in four men, under the stature covered by corrugated sheets and old banners,"" said the police officer. Inside, there was a pile of liquor bottles, bags, clothes, syringes, a mosquito net and even some cash. Cops seized the stuff, destroyed the den and arrested one, who was hiding there. ""We have arrested one person, Shoaib Molla (32), and charged him under IPC sections 399 and 402 that deal with assembling and making preparations to commit dacoity. We are questioning him to know for how long they have been staying there and who all are his associates,"" said the officer.

PG student wins big at national-level event,"Ashish Rajan, a first-year post-graduation student of the geriatrics department at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) won the first pr",,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"AURANGABAD: Ashish Rajan, a first-year post-graduation student of the geriatrics department at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) won the first prize in paper presentation at the 15th International Conference on Geriatric Care and Gerontology (GSICON 2018) held in Pune on October 27 and 28. Under the guidance of the HoD of geriatrics, Mangala Borkar, and associate professor Shailaja Rao, Rajan had undertaken research on HIV positive cases first diagnosed in the geriatric age. The annual conference of the Geriatric Society of India (GSI), GSICON, was jointly organized by the Pune chapter of the Society and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune on the theme getting old is mandatory, feeling old is optional. International faculty Tahir Masud and the general secretary of the GSI, OP Sharma, were present. Rajan presented a paper on the retrospective study done, which was based on the records of the ART PLUS Centre at GMCH, to assess the clinical profile of newly-diagnosed HIV positive geriatric patients. Explaining the study, the PG student says that the HIV infection is common in the younger age group (under 45 years). However, there are geriatric patients who are HIV positive. Some may have being diagnosed in their late 40s or 50s and are surviving in their 60s due to good management. A few may have been diagnosed for the first time at the age of 60 or above. This study consists of the latter group, Rajan states. The paper states that many older individuals lack knowledge about safe sex and perceive themselves to be at a low risk. The testing rate among them is lower and they often present at a late stage. Drug therapy of both age related co-morbidities and HIV can increase the side effects. The study shows that 2.96% patients were diagnosed for HIV for the first time at a geriatric age. Many elderly individuals may be sexually active and need to be educated about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in a tactful and discreet manner, the research concludes. Mahesh Patil and Zeba Firdous contributed to the study. Patil had also presented a poster on the screening of geriatric patients for dementia at the event.

"Woman contracts HIV after blood transfusion, Madras HC seeks report",CHENNAI: The Madras high court Thursday took suo motu cognisance of an incident in which a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district contracted HIV afte.,Pti,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court Thursday took suo motu cognisance of an incident in which a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district contracted HIV after transfusion of contaminated blood and directed the state government to file an action taken and status report by January 3. When the vacation bench comprising justice S Vaidyanathan and justice PT Asha commenced proceedings, two advocates made a mention of the case. The advocates -- George Williams and Krishnamoorthy -- moved an urgent motion about the blood transfusion and sought the court to take suo motu cognisance of the issue. Williams submitted that he would like to bring the matter to the notice of the court and was not willing to file any petition. The Bench then said it would like to take suo motu cognisance and issued notice to the health secretary seeking a status report on the incident and action taken against the errant officials by January 3. On December 3, the woman visited the Sattur government hospital for antenatal checks where she was advised blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days after the procedure, it came to light that the blood transfused was HIV positive and was negligently labelled safe by the hospital's lab technicians. Originally, the blood was donated by a teenager which was meant to be transfused to his relative. But, since it was not used, it was stored in the blood bank. Immediately after the issue was brought to the notice of the authorities, three health workers of the blood bank at the government hospital in Sivakasi were placed under suspension for labelling the HIV positive blood as safe. On further inquiry, it was found the hospital authorities had found that the donor was affected by HIV as early as 2016 when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur. But as the teenager was out of town when a counsellor phoned him to inform, he was asked to report to the hospital as early as possible. On December 27, the donor had attempted suicide by consuming rat poison as his family struggled to deal with the issue.

HIV+ donor who infected woman tries to kill self,"India News: MADURAI/CHENNAI: The teenage donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday .",Tnn,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI/CHENNAI: The teenage donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday as the families struggled to deal with the tragedy and more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public healthcare personnel. The woman has lodged a complaint against unknown doctors and nurses for the transfusion and sought stringent action against them. The government has arranged all facilities at the Madurai government hospital and sacked three employees for the tragic mix-up. But there is evidence to show public health care officials had at least two chances to prevent the tragedy. For one, the donor had been identified as HIV positive two years ago, in 2016, when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur in Virudhunagar district. The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the government hospital there should have told the youth he had HIV. The counsellor did call him up but only told him to report to the centre. Counsellors normally do not break the news over phone. But the counsellor she did not pursue the case when he did not turn up . Second, the blood bank staff could have prevented the catastrophe had they tested the blood he donated on November 30, again at the Sattur government hospital. The lab technician labelled it safe and a woman and her unborn child are paying for his negligence. It had been issued to a woman at the Sivakasi GH on December 3. The woman had come to the GH for antenatal checks. Doctors told her that she had to undergo blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days later, a private hospital in Madurai tested the donor positive for HIV and referred him to Sattur GH. ""He had gone to the private hospital because blood tests were mandatory for an employment visa. On inquiry, the counsellor at Sattur GH identified him. She called the blood bank to alert them. By then the blood was issued,"" an official said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

"HIV pulled them down, love gave hope",An infected needle turned Arun’s* life upside down.,,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"An infected needle turned Aruns* life upside down. In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhikas* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of AIDS research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society. ""When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,"" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. ""She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,"" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking. Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. ""I hadnt told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didnt want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,"" says Arun, an engineer. Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career  as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married  she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played matchmaker for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhikas was the first success story. With Dr Solomons encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. Thats when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind. Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. ""I didnt want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,"" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Aruns family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language. But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. ""We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,"" says Arun. Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Aruns family, or their son. ""There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,"" says Radhika. ""But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,"" says Radhika. Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. ""If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,"" he says. He has just one word of advice for people. ""If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life.""

Rehana Fathima is no pilgrim,By: J Devika Ever since chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared CPM’s commitment to Kerala’s unique legacy of enlightened Hinduism on the Sabarimala .,Updated,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"By: J DevikaEver since chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared CPMs commitment to Keralas unique legacy of enlightened Hinduism on the Sabarimala issue, I have been wondering about the relative absence of CPMs mass organization of women, whose membership runs into lakhs. I have firsthand knowledge that very many of its members are devout Hindus. If CPM were serious about drawing upon this legacy, I wondered, why is it that they are not making an active effort to encourage these women (and devout men in their other mass organizations) to embrace the Supreme Courts valiant effort to ensure gender equality in the Hindu faith? Why is it not actively campaigning within its fold that undertaking the Sabarimala pilgrimage at this crucial moment in history is a key gesture of self-respect for female devotees? If CPM would have done that, we would not have been subject to this extremely painful sight of women trying to make it to the shrine, only to be violently ejected by criminals, hooligans and frenzied women, all emboldened by the brazen takeover of public space there by Hindutva elements. Definitely, CPM could have made sure that believers in their fold, male and female, made it to the shrine safe and sound. If so, stray activists need not have risked their lives. I do not know if Rehana Fathima, a young woman who has often cocked a snook at conservative gender/sexual norms, who attempted the pilgrimage on Friday, was deliberately set up by Hindutva elements to create the impression that the shrine was in the danger of being sullied by bad/women who are also non-Hindu. I dont know if minister Kadakampally Surendrans intervention was really to avert violence. Even if his intervention was really to that end, his indignant pronouncement that Sabarimala was not a playground for activists did irreversible harm. In itself, there is nothing wrong with Rehanas action: the Supreme Court permits womens entry now and tradition does not bar people of other faiths from visiting the shrine. There are no standards established to measure the intensity of belief; even if they do exist, they are not applied to potential male pilgrims. It may indeed be the case that there were good reasons for the minister to stop Rehana. My point is, however, about the discourse he couches it in, which turns it into an affront against believers. This is not mitigated by his shrewd choice of words  activist, instead of Muslim-born, or wayward woman. One is even persuaded to think that CPM and BJP have arrived at a resolution of this chicken-game-like situation in which neither party can turn back without suffering loss of face. The resolution involves setting up an other around which true believers may consolidate themselves, the constituency of BJP, but one which CPM would like to woo too. Kadakampallys offended tone directed at the activist would help CPM do exactly this as it conveys a commitment to the purity of the shrine, even as it continues to encourage the believing/ good woman! The stance adopted by CPM supporters  that they do not ask any woman to visit the shrine, only ensure a safe pilgrimage for any woman who chooses to go  creates the impression that there are no believers among them and therefore the toil of democratizing the Hindu community does not fall on them. This allows them to keep their mainstream Hindu base more or less invisible, exempt themselves from the burden of shaping new believers from within, and at the same time, keep up the appearance of neutrality in matters of religious faith. Nevertheless, they do want to gain from the social momentum unleashed by the Supreme Court judgment. Hence the goodcop bad-cop game: Pinarayi thunders about the legacy of Keralas social democratization in general (or Kodiyeri Balakrishnan defends activists); Kadakampally reacts in harsh tones against the specific instance of a womens activist trying to make hay while the sun shines. Kadakampally keeps his liberal-Hindu image, of one who supports true women of the faith and simultaneously signals his commitment to the purity of Sabarimala. The scapegoat in this sordid game is the activist woman, a figure feared by both Hindutva right wing and Left-wing mainstream. There can be little doubt that these activist women have caused these authorities the greatest worry in recent years. From sex workers to nuns, teagarden labourers to glamorous film stars, from the delicate-looking but steelwilled Hadiya to fearless young dalit women students, they have repeatedly, persistently, challenged the mainstream consensus on gender justice and social order  despite, mind you, the combined might of the police, the lower judiciary, caste leaders, community authorities, school principals, tearful parents, armies of hostile relatives, sexual offenders in offices, foul-mouthed male hordes online. Maybe history will treat Kadakampallys reference as a compliment, albeit oblique. The writer is a scholar and author.

"Ruts, waterlogging & gravel mar a pleasant drive on Wanowrie Marg","PUNE: The Wanowrie Marg, an arterial 2km road for residents of Wanowrie and parts of Kondhwa, is in a shambles from the T-junction at Prince of Wales .",,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"PUNE: The Wanowrie Marg, an arterial 2km road for residents of Wanowrie and parts of Kondhwa, is in a shambles from the T-junction at Prince of Wales Drive till the Mhammadevi Chowk near St Marys Church and beyond on General Bhagat Marg. The road is traffic laden throughout the day. Travelling along the Command Hospital road has been a nightmarish experience for NIBM Road resident Rahul Bahal. The numerous potholes, ruts in the road and loose gravel dislodged by the steady traffic are the cause. Bahal has been using the road for several years now. The potholes re-appear almost immediately after repairs are undertaken, he said. I have been travelling along this road for eight years, first, to go to college and now for work. The patch around Command Hospital near the Armed Forces Medical College is a big problem. The road is waterlogged even after a light shower and even if repaired the road gets damaged quickly. It is a big inconvenience for hundreds of commuters. Loose gravel at many spots spreads by the day on the road posing a threat to motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, he said. Bahal added that good quality repairs and a permanent solution is a must to improve the road conditions. Other commuters from the area have questioned the quality of repairs undertaken in the patch due to the recurring potholes year on year. Wanowrie resident Yuvraj Chaudhary said,  Potholes appear at the same spots as the previous year. The road condition from outside The Bishops School to the Prince of Wales Drive has deteriorated over the years despite repairs. There are huge potholes outside this school, St Marys School, at the St Marys Church junction and beyond the signal too. Thousands of children commute daily on this road and the condition of the road poses a risk to all of them. Petrol dealer Ali Daruwalla, who has his petrol pump in the area, said he has often seen two-wheelers skid due to the gravel on the road. The condition of the road is deplorable and no one has taken any cognizance of the situation. Some day there may be a huge accident. Before it happens, the authorities must wake up. The road needs to be repaired as people are skidding and getting hurt. Authorities must take responsibility for the road and get work done at the earliest to avert any major accident, he said. Chief executive officer of Pune Cantonment Board DN Yadav said, The road is under maintenance by Military Engineering Services. We cannot undertake repairs on this road. The stretch comes under Garrison Engineer (south) and Garrison Engineer (north). We have carried out a post-monsoon survey of the stretch. But, we could not commence the repair work as the budgetary allocation has not been sanctioned as yet, a senior defence official told TOI on Saturday.

Audacity of crime caught Delhi Police totally by surprise,"Friday's bank robbery is not good news for Delhi Police.For at least a decade, none had dared target a bank in this manner.",,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Friday's bank robbery is not good news for Delhi Police. For at least a decade, none had dared target a bank in this manner. The cops are apprehensive that the successful day-time heist may have removed the fear of potential robbers of being nabbed on the bank premises by the customers and employees or of being surrounded by police alerted via secret alarms. The cops were able to recall only two bank-related crimes in the past few years, both burglaries carried out in at night. In the first incident in August last year, three thieves managed to sneak into Syndicate Bank in Mukherjee Nagar through the window. Taking advantage of the weekend closure, the men managed to hack the window grilles to enter the building. They made away with Rs 2.3 lakh worth of coins in 46 polythene bags. The cops, however, did not have to pursue the intruders for long and nabbed them within 48 hours. In the second incident on December 22, 2017, the three men involved dug a tunnel to the Cooperative Bank in outer Delhi's Mundka from a vacant adjacent plot. Armed with gas cutters and cylinders, they drilled a hole in the wall, entered the building one by one and disabled the CCTV cameras and the security alarm. The trio took away the CCTV footage recorders along with around Rs 30 lakh in cash and some jewellery having broken into at least 15 lockers. The cops arrested the three men after a month of investigation. Rather than break-ins of this sort, robbing of cash vans has been more common in the city these last five years or so. The criminals take advantage of the fact that cash companies often ferry large amounts of money to and from banks without providing police with prior information. In April this year, for instance, robbers shot dead two and fled with Rs 12 lakh from a cash van. Some incidents have involved the employees of the cash replenishment firms. They were caught stealing cash while refilling ATMs. However, an armed robbery was an unheard of for a lengthy period. For a city that is under constant terror threat, Friday's incident can set a precedent and encourage criminals and terrorists to execute similar capers to fund their gang and illegal activities. The Delhi Police brass has asked joint commissioners and deputy commissioners to take steps in this regard and conduct meetings with bank officials to sensitise them about the security measures that need to be taken to avert robberies.

Smoke detected at Bagri market in Kolkata,KOLKATA: Smoke was detected in a pile of debris inside room number 213 in the gutted portion of Bagri market on Friday morning.,,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: Smoke was detected in a pile of debris inside room number 213 in the gutted portion of Bagri market on Friday morning. Two fire tenders took 15 minutes to extinguish it. A fire on September 16 had ravaged a portion of Bagri market gutting almost 200 shops. The market has been shut since then and a lot of debri is yet to be removed. Smoke was detected at the debris from the gutted Bagri Market. The source of the smoke could not be detected. There must have been a spark, which can be triggered by cigarette butt also. The smoke could be contended before the fire tender reach there. But we have stationed one fire tender there. KMC has been working to clear the debris to avert any untoward incident, said a senior fire brigade officer. The smoke was detected at 9.20 am and it was extinguished by 9.35 am. It seems the smoke was due to some heat trapped in one of the pockets. Everything is normal. The fire department did a very good job, said Asutosh Singh, the president of the Bagri Market Central Kolkata Traders Welfare Association. Room number 213 is located on the second floor of the C block of the market which has been the worst affected portion in the market. The fire raged for over 82 hours due to the presence of inflammable material and defunct fire system inside the market.

In this scenario, Neanderthals bequeathed to modern humans not only infectious viruses but also the genetic tools to combat the invaders.

An HIV-positive dream hits house hurdle in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: They are a bunch of 10 ordinary teenagers, who nourish the dream of making it big.",,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: They are a bunch of 10 ordinary teenagers, who nourish the dream of making it big. But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. Out to open their own caf called Cafe Positive, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkatas posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about who will manage and run the shop. While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying e paray erom cholbena (such business wont run in this neighbourhood), others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens. The NGO funding the caf and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, Lake Road, Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. We have been looking for a suitable space for the caf since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out, said Kallol Ghosh, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children. TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. I would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer, said a landlady. The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. I dont know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with HIV. I dont think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery, he said. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories. The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this caf project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the caf to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it. We have been undergoing training at this shelter and cant wait to start our caf. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults dont understand that HIV doesnt spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us, said Susanta Pal (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5. HIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our caf. But for that, we first need an opportunity, said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies. According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor caf will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. We are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready, lamented Ghosh.

‘Govt must extend facilities to LGBTQ’,"NAGPUR: People should first be humane to each other and not judge anyone on the basis of their sexual preferences, said Nikunj Joshi, LGBTQ activist a.",Tnn,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: People should first be humane to each other and not judge anyone on the basis of their sexual preferences, said Nikunj Joshi, LGBTQ activist and CEO of Saarthi Trust on Wednesday. Speaking at a panel discussion on Homosexuality: Changing attitude: Supreme Court and Society, organized by Press Club of Nagpur in the wake of the historic Supreme Court judgment to decriminalize gay sex. Though section 377 has been struck down, there still exists a social stigma around homosexuals and transgenders. This could be wiped out by creating awareness as people usually confuse gender with sexuality. Like heterosexuals, our sexuality or sexual orientation is part of our personal life none of which should define us, said Joshi. LGBTQ community should also start wearing their sexuality on sleeves and shed inhibitions of being different, he added. Transgender activist Vidya Kamble, former major and HIV specialist Dr Milind Bhrushundi, MLA Dr Milind Mane and social activist Girish Gandhi participated in the discussion. Talking about transgenders rights, Kamble said, Today, we are struggling for facilities as basic as a public toilet. We dont have basic identification documents and it becomes the basis of rejection on professional front. The SC has passed the judgment but the ground reality is different. The government should extend benefits and include us in education schemes, she said. We have a population of 750 transgenders in the city and proper education and a little support from the society will help us earn daily bread, she added. Dr Bhrushundi spoke about issues a homosexual faces while growing up and the positive effect of the judgment in curbing HIV. A person growing up with different sexual orientation is not just confused about himself but fears facing the society due to stigma. This makes it twice as difficult for him to accept himself and takes a toll on his mental health, he said. He said, HIV is mainly prevalent in two sections of the society  heterosexuals aged between 15-25 years and in LGBTQ community. Fortunately, it has now become easier for us to identify the affected persons and curb it disease. It is easier for homosexuals to accept their ailment, said Bhrushundi.

The captain looked him up and down, and said I dont play with beginners. Eight months later, Alexander was ranked fourth in the Delhi championships, and he had defeated the captain twice. In college, all I wanted to do was play chess. My academic record was good, but my chess performances were better. I even considered dropping out of college in my third year, to play chess full time, but better counsel prevailed, he laughs. Alexanders father was PC Alexander, the IAS officer who later became Indira Gandhis principal secretary, the governor of Tamil Nadu and then Maharashtra, and was proposed by AB Vajpayees government as their nominee for president of India. His presidency was opposed by the Congress party. My fathers career saw many highs, but it also saw some tremendous lows. Even back then, there were times when his career was almost wrecked. And though it was my fathers fond hope that I would follow in his footsteps and become an IAS officer, I was sure that I did not want to get into government service. A number of things happened which convinced me that I did not want to be at the mercy of politicians  and frankly, I did not want to be a bureaucrat. I wanted to avoid the IAS at all costs, Alexander laughs. There were other experiences that shaped the young Alexander when he was growing up. In 1963, his father was posted to New York, working at the UN. The family moved with him, and they stayed there for four years. I still remember the dates, says Alexander. We landed in New York on October 15th, 1963. On 22 November, that year, President John F Kennedy was assassinated. Less than three months later, The Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show, he says. Alexander went to an international school in New York, growing up when the country was undergoing a period of dramatic social change. It was the time of the Vietnam War  with carnage on TV every night. It was the time of student protests against the war. It was a time of flower power and the British invasion, with bands like the Rolling Stones and the Kinks and the Animals and the Yardbirds dominating the charts. And it was also the time of the space race, as the US and the USSR vied for supremacy, and the Indian teen covered his wall with posters of astronauts and spacecraft. But those days had to come to an end. In 1967, PC Alexander decided to return to India. He was bored. He was finishing his work for the day in two to three hours. And this was anathema to a man who worked almost to the point of collapse when he was in India, says Alexander. I was shocked, he says. Then, he pauses, and reflects. My fathers career is full of incidents where he gave up what was a comfortable, well paying position, to take up something that he felt he had to do. The pattern seems to have repeated itself in my life as well, he says. After completing his economics degree from St Stephens, Alexander followed it up with a masters from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Management from IIM, Ahmedabad. From IIMA, Alexander joined Price Waterhouse, and did well there. He was posted to Hong Kong, but work still took second place to chess. It was at one of those chess competitions that I met someone who was working for McKinsey. Now, people who play chess have a reputation for intelligence, but few people realize that chess intelligence doesnt translate well to real life, he says, with a twinkle in his eye. But this person convinced me that I would fit in well at McKinsey. So I applied, flew down to New York, attended a series of interviews and was selected, he says. But it wasnt smooth sailing at McKinsey for Alexander. I was assigned to a project on reinsurance, and I didnt know anything about it. I also did not get along well with my engagement manager, and at the end of the year, I got a report which began with the words Good news, but also included the line He still has to demonstrate that he has the ability and virtue of teamwork required to succeed in the Firm. I was quite happy with the report, but when I showed it to others  including my father  their reaction was one of shock. This means that you are going to be fired if this happens again, said a colleague. That was the beginning of a dark period for Alexander, but he slowly changed the negative first impression by working tirelessly on a project that no one else wanted, working through a freezing Colorado winter. As his reputation turned around, he also began evangelizing the idea of a McKinsey operation in India. It was clear that my IIM classmates were as good, if not better that the Harvard types that worked in McKinsey in those days. McKinsey set up shop in India just as liberalization transformed the countrys economy, and Alexander thrived, ultimately heading the consultancys operations in Delhi. And then, Bill Gates visited India. The Gates Foundation was attempting to tackle the problem of HIV, and Alexander accompanied him. Fascinated with the scope of the problem, he left McKinsey to join the Gates Foundation in India. During his nine years as the head of the Gates Foundation in India, he designed and implemented the highly regarded Avahan programme. Working with the Gates Foundation, I realized that the money, the glamour, all of that was an illusion. I realized that I had to give something back. I really wasnt prepared for what I would see on the ground. The poverty, the terrible state of a country that I hadnt really been aware of. It changed me. Some things that I took from McKinsey were my training in problem identification and solving, and it is something that is lacking in many areas of the social sector. Now, Alexander is running his own NGO, the Antara foundation, which works on improving maternal and child health outcomes. Its a far cry from working with the Gates Foundation. There we disbursed 370 million dollars over ten years. Now Im grateful for a donation of a few lakh rupees, he says. He stops, and thinks for a few seconds. Its the steepest learning curve that I have ever encountered he says. But thats what keeps me going.

"Police probe to fix role of railway authorities, others",PUNE : The Pune police have started a probe to fix the responsibility of the railway officials and the contractor in the dismantling of the 40-foot-hi.,Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"PUNE : The Pune police have started a probe to fix the responsibility of the railway officials and the contractor in the dismantling of the 40-foot-high metal hoarding frame, which came crashing down on the road near Juna Bazaar on Friday and killed four persons. Police commissioner K Venkatesham told TOI on Saturday, We have arrested the railway engineer entrusted with the task of removing the hoarding frame on its premises (railway land). We have launched a hunt for the contractor who cut the hoarding frame. We are still probing the case and depending upon the outcome, more action will be taken. Senior inspector M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police said, Our investigation is focused on identifying the railway authorities, who gave the contract, those who were monitoring the work and those responsible for the security of people. We have sought documents from the railway authorities related to the contract and allied details, and will examine the same. Mujawar further said, The railway authorities had given the contract to remove the hoarding frame to a private contractor, who is at large with his employees. Our team visited the residences of the contractor and his employees, but they were not there at home. On the probe related to how the accident occurred, Mujawar said, The frame came crashing down on the autorickshaws and other vehicles on the road with a huge force. The contractors employees had started dismantling the metal frame directly from the bottom instead of removing the upper parts of the structure first. They tied a rope to the metal frame and tried to pull it down towards the railway land. But something went wrong, and the frame swung towards the opposite direction and fell on the road with a catapult effect. The railway authorities did not follow the due diligence, Mujawar said. They could have halted the vehicular movement on the road for a few minutes while removing the structure or executed the task in the night. CP meets civic chief Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham and Pune municipal Corporation (PMC) chief Saurabh Rao had a meeting on Saturday on illegal hoardings in the city. I assured my full support to the civic admininstation in its drive against illegal hoardings. We want to avert such incidents in future, he said.

"2 patients allege Davanagere hospital issued false HIV-positive reports, file plaints",BENGALURU: A labourer and a homemaker have filed separate complaints with the health department against a Davanagere private hospital for allegedly gi.,,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"BENGALURU: A labourer and a homemaker have filed separate complaints with the health department against a Davanagere private hospital for allegedly giving them false HIV-positive reports. They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression. Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports. The hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed, Raju told TOI. Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. The blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings  they showed she was HIV-positive  and underwent stress and psychological trauma, said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable. The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. ICTCs report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test, said Prahlad. Sushmithas medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didnt even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report. Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. In Halappas case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings cant be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin, he said. Cases pending before court: HospitalWhen TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. The cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we cant comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry, said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital. Negligence cases not under KPME ActIn 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. But the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration. Medical negligence cases dont come under it, said Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere.

Preventing the infection is very important, but there is no vaccine available yet.Researchers found that levels of Treg lymphocytes were higher in the blood of newborn babies born to mothers with HIV infection who had escaped the infection themselves, compared with babies who were born with HIV infection.Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses. In contrast, other lymphocyte types were activated and higher in HIV-infected infants. The HIV virus can only infect cells that are activated, so Treg may protect from HIV infection by suppressing activation of other lymphocytes.They analyzed the stored blood by flow cytometry, a technique that can differentiate between the different types of cells based on what markers they express on their surface. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express the markers CD4, CD25, and FOXP3.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/hiv-vaccine-comes-closer-to-reality/articleshow/64537148.cms

Fatehpur’s ‘HIV village’ has seen no fresh case in 5 years,Residents of this small village in Fatehpur district would empathise with HIV-affected Bangarmau town in Unnao the most.,,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"UDAI SARAI (Fatehpur): Residents of this small village in Fatehpur district would empathise with HIV-affected Bangarmau town in Unnao the most. More than 12 years ago, their village had hit headlines for reporting a large number of HIV positive cases in a health camp. The incident had lent Udai Sarai a negative image, feel its residents, some of them relieved that the tag is now for Bangarmaus villages. Whenever I told people I was from Udai Sarai, they used to quickly check if it was the same HIV village that made news a few years ago. Though I was embarrassed, I had to accept the truth, said former village head Dhanraj. The Unnao villages incident is unfortunate, he added, referring to the case where a quack had infected 58 people with a syringe. But things will change if people determine. Take the case of our village, no new HIV case has been reported in Udai Sarai for a few years. This will help us shun the bad image, he added. Awareness measures have helped Udai Sarai stay HIV-free for 5 years Women spearheading change by discussing prevention In the detection in 2005, 52 people had tested positive for HIV. Of them, 48 have died while the remaining are on anti-retroviral therapy. The village, barely 18km from a government hospital, was home to around 500 families at that time. At least one member from each was working in Maharashtra or Gujarat. With migrant population believed to be a major reason for the virus, HIV came to be known as Mumbai wali bimari here. Today, 90% of the 700 houses in the village have someone working in Maharashtra but no new case has been reported in the past five years. Women have driven the change by openly talking about prevention, claim health activists and officials. Caution has become their second nature. Women maketheir husbands get themselves tested for HIV at least once a year, said Vidya Devi, who was a newly wed in 2005. Anganwadi worker Gyan Swaroopa has been a hero of HIV prevention by counselling the women. Breaking barriers of shame and harassmentthere is fear of being teased by men for talking about sexshe speaks openly to every boy who heads to Mumbai. Isme kahekisharam... jaan hai to jahan hai (Why be ashamed of doing my duty. Health and survival are the most important), she reasons. As a result, the air of stigma around HIV is absent in this village. You can pose direct questions on HIV here unlike in other villages. In fact, HIV testing is considered even at the onset of a simplefever, saidRajendra Sahu of Nehru Yuva Sangathan Tisi, a social organisation working to create awareness around HIV/ AIDS. Village head Jagatpal said: The men have been told to have sex only with their wives. The elders keep an eye on the behaviour of their children. Those in Mumbai keep an eye on each other and ensure that no one gets deviated. Medical advice is taken for every disease. Even a simple fever is not ignored and HIV testing is done. No HIV positive case has been reported from this village in five years, said Dr SP Jauhari, secretary of the district aids control society. However, HIV cases in Fatehpur district have continued to rise. Against 97 cases in 2014, 163 cases were reported in 2017. January alone this year has seen 27 cases, data from the health department shows.

Contest of one-min films aims to tackle HIV/AIDS stigma,"PANAJI: In order to challenge HIV and AIDS-related stigma and explore its negative impact on people living with HIV, the Human Touch Foundation, a you.",Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: In order to challenge HIV and AIDS-related stigma and explore its negative impact on people living with HIV, the Human Touch Foundation, a youth-led organization that works in the field of HIV is organizing a one-minute film competition on HIV stigma. The theme seeks to do away with HIV and AIDS discrimination in terms of self and social acceptance, access to HIV prevention and treatment services, education and employment opportunities as well as many other aspects of everyday life. HIV and AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refer to negative perceptions and attitudes, misconceptions, prejudice and abuse directed at people living with HIV. Despite the remarkable progress made in advancing HIV science, stigma and discrimination which is founded on the fear surrounding the early AIDS pandemic in the 1980s continues to persist to this day, says founder, Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are invariably devastating, he adds, stating that some people are shunned by family, friends, community and society, while others face poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, violation of their human rights, and psychological damage. These push people living with HIV and key populations further underground, limiting their access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment and other lifesaving health services, he says. The contest is open to students of higher secondary schools and colleges affiliated to Goa Board and Goa University. The last date to submit the films November 20 by email- getintouch@humantouch.ngo.

State joins forces with private players to eliminate TB,"Around 2000 TB cases are detected each year in Goa, the state tuberculosis officer and chief medical officer of the revised national tuberculosis cont",Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Around 2000 TB cases are detected each year in Goa, the state tuberculosis officer and chief medical officer of the revised national tuberculosis control programme, Dr Maximiano De Sa said on Friday. Since a very small proportion of the cases detected in the private sector are not notified and brought to the notice of the government, he said it is high time that private and public sector join hands to eliminate TB in the state. Goa has a strong private sector which is 50:50. Many TB patients prefer private doctors, as first point of contact, because of privacy issue. We need strong support from our colleagues in the private sector, in notifying such TB cases, he stated during the state launch of Joint Effort to Eliminate TB (JEET) at Panaji. Notified patients will be offered drugs free of cost supplied by WHO qualified pharma companies which undergo stringent quality check mechanisms. Notified patients will also be provided with associated services like HIV testing, multi drug resistance testing, counseling and chemo prophylaxis he stated. While De Sa highlighted the problem of undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated TB, he said the emergence of a deadly form of the disease i.e drug resistant TB is a bigger worry. TB spreads very easily because it is airborne and there is already a threat of this drug resistant TB spreading, he stated. He also added that the government of India recently launched a social support scheme to help all TB patients by offering them Rs 500 each month for the entire duration of their treatment i.e 6-8 months and for multi drig resistant TB- 2 years. Around 300 patients in the state have availed of this scheme he stated. The JEET project aims for intensive engagement of private sector to achieve universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment for TB and help the nation in achieving The National Strategic Plan to eliminate TB by 2025.

HIV people with positive attitude,By: Anindita Acharya CHANDIGARH: At the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre of the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) .,Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"By: Anindita Acharya CHANDIGARH: At the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre of the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) for HIVpositive people, you might notice a woman in her midforties, sitting in a corner, wearing a big smile, engaging in polite conservation with the visitors, scribbling down their profile. She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004. She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners, said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative. There was no happily ever after in Meenas life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive, Meena said. People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less. Network of friendsMeena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Networks president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling. Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother. Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100. CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex, said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years. DiscriminationMeena said: More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years, said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years. The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write universal precaution instead of HIV positive on their hospital cards, so that the chemists dont look at us differently when they see the stamp. Admit our kidsIf our identity is revealed, our children wont get admission in schools, said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. For seven years, no progress, she said.

Social science institutes don't attract funds easily: Tiss director,"MUMBAI: Social science institutes don't attract funding easily, be it from the government or the corporate sector, said professor Shalini Bharat, who .",,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: Social science institutes don't attract funding easily, be it from the government or the corporate sector, said professor Shalini Bharat, who officially took over as TISS director on Tuesday. ""People are investing in research park, innovation cells, but we don't see any funding coming our way...We do not even have enough seed funding to work on our ideas,"" she said. Bharat, who was the deputy director (academics) at TISS, was holding additional charge as the director for over six months, after S Parasuraman retired in February. Speaking about the challenges faced by the premier institute, Bharat said the financial situation is not so good and they would need support from various sources. ""We are reaching out to people. It is matter of converting all the good wishes to actual funds. Many have shown interest and we are getting money, but it is nowhere close to what we need."" The shortage of funds in social sciences' sector paints a worrying picture for institutes like TISS. TISS had competed for the Institutes of Eminence tag from the MHRD but lost out to other institutes despite having the highest NAAC rating in the country. It was granted grade-I autonomy status recently. ""The challenge now is to consolidate what we already have and do quality research, and work with communities and disadvantaged groups... More importantly, we want to evaluate the impact of our work. We will have to see what more needs to be done and how,"" Bharat said. Though physical expansion of the campus is not on cards, she intends to start courses where there is a possibility of revenue generation. ""People are keen to have a degree from TISS. We will have to acc- ordingly design courses based on the need of the industry."" The new director is keen on bringing some stability across their campuses. ""Students have raised a few issues in the recent past, which are importa- nt. There have been some problems (referring to the recent protests over scholarships) but we have commenced work to augment our endowments and to get more scholarships and more fellowships for them. There is a shortage, but we are trying to raise funds and support many more students. It may not exactly match their demands, but we are making a sincere effort,"" said Bharat. For the last two years, UGC has been hinting at the closure of few centres, including the ones working on social exclusion and inclusive policies, women's studies and human rights. ""We are constantly in dialogue with the UGC and we are hoping for a positive outcome,"" she said. From research point of view, she said she would continue to work on her projects in the health sector, like studying the impact of counselling on health systems and self-testing for HIV.

Stigma of HIV makes people quit UP villages,BANGARMAU (UNNAO): Panic among the residents of Unnao villages under the grips of an HIV scare is driving many to relocate over fears of banishment.,,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"BANGARMAU (UNNAO): Panic among the residents of Unnao villages under the grips of an HIV scare is driving many to relocate over fears of banishment. Mukesh* of Premganj is one of them. His elder sister was engaged to a man from the neighbouring Hardoi district and the family happily making arrangements for the wedding. But the would be in-laws of his sister have stopped taking their calls since the news of HIV infections in Premganj and two adjoining villages made headlines. When Mukesh tried to contact them through a mediator, they called off the match. No one in my family is infected, but moving away seems to be the only option left for us. Otherwise who will marry my siblings, including four sisters? Mukesh asked. Shivam (45), a class-IV civic employee, lives with his mother (80). Both tested negative for HIV, but he feels ostracised by relatives. Life is no better at work either. My colleagues have started ignoring me, he said. Ratnesh (28) tested positive and is devastated. A Class VIII dropout, he lives with his two sisters and parents in Premganj and works as a palledar in Galla Mandi. A grocer refused to sell things to me. My friend has suggested I shift from here. I know the time has come to leave Premganj, he said. However, Unnao chief medical officer S P Chowdhary said there was no need for panic. Health teams will hold check-up camps, where counsellors will be available, with nukkad natak teams roped in as well to spread awareness, he said.

HIV scare puts quacks under lens,"The risk of HIV infection through used needles is a clear and present danger in rural Madhya Pradesh, as nearly 50% of quacks operating in villages ha",,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"BHOPAL: The risk of HIV infection through used needles is a clear and present danger in rural Madhya Pradesh, as nearly 50% of quacks operating in villages have no formal training and zero awareness on the virus. Reports of a quack in Uttar Pradesh infecting 58 people with HIV by using infected needles have shaken the MP government into the need to monitor quacks, who roam around the hinterland posing as doctors. The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds. What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts  sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks. We target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday, said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. Crackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration, he added. However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP. The number of HIV/AIDS patients in MP is 0.09% of the population  less than national adult prevalence of 0.27% (2013). In 2016, NACO reported 44,427 AIDS patients in MP. Quacks exploit the lacunae in healthcare in MP. The state has about 4,500 MBBS doctors for the health department whereas WHO estimates say there is a need for at least 15,000 more.

Per capita alcohol consumption more than doubled in India between 2005-16: WHO,"India News: NEW DELHI: Per capita alcohol consumption in India has more than doubled from 2005 to 2016, according to a report by the WHO.",Pti,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Per capita alcohol consumption in India has more than doubled from 2005 to 2016, according to a report by the WHO. In India, the consumption of alcohol has increased from 2.4 litres in 2005 to 5.7 litres in 2016 with 4.2 litres being consumed by men and 1.5 litre by women, it said. The total alcohol per capita consumption (15+ years) is expected to increase in half of the WHO regions by 2025 and the highest increase is expected in the southeast Asia Region. An increase of 2.2 litres is expected in India alone which represents a large proportion of the total population in this region, the report highlighted. However, increases, although smaller, are also expected in Indonesia and Thailand (with the second- and fourth-largest largest populations). The second-highest increase is projected for the populations of the Western Pacific Region, where the population of China is the largest, with an increase in per capita consumption of 0.9 litres of pure alcohol by 2025. Total alcohol per capita consumption has increased globally after a relatively stable phase between 2000 and 2005. Since then, total per capita consumption rose from 5.5 litres in 2005 to 6.4 litres in 2010 and was still at the level of 6.4 litres in 2016, the report stated. However, diverging trends were noticed in different regions of the world. The harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health worldwide and has a direct impact on many health-related targets of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious diseases (HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), noncommunicable diseases and mental health, injuries and poisonings. In 2016, the harmful use of alcohol resulted in some 3 million deaths (5.3 per cent of all deaths) worldwide and 132.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Mortality resulting from alcohol consumption is higher than that caused by diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Among men in 2016, an estimated 2.3 million deaths and 106.5 million DALYs were attributable to the consumption of alcohol. 0.7 million women died and they experienced 26.1 million DALYs attributable to alcohol consumption. The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions, the report stated. Some 2.3 billion people are current drinkers. Globally more than a quarter (26.5 per cent) of all 1519 year-olds are current drinkers, amounting to 155 million adolescents. The WHO has emphasized on the development, implementation and evaluation of cost-effective interventions for harmful use of alcohol as well as creating, compiling and disseminating scientific information on alcohol use and dependence, and related health and social consequences. The ""Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol"", negotiated and agreed by WHO Member States in 2010, represents international consensus that reducing the harmful use of alcohol and its associated health and social burden is a public health priority. The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including 10 recommended target areas for policy options and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at country level.

"Tiny, portable device can quickly detect cancer",Science News: NEW YORK: Scientists have developed cancer detector – about half the size of a lunch box – that can be used to quickly and accurately diagnose the dis.,,07-10-2018,The Times of India,,{},"['tiny', 'device', 'cancer', 'power', 'qpcr', 'quickly', 'testing', 'remote', 'detect', 'subsaharan', 'samples', 'portable', 'ks', 'nucleic', 'uganda']","NEW YORK: Scientists have developed cancer detector – about half the size of a lunch box – that can be used to quickly and accurately diagnose the disease in remote parts of the world.Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a cancer that develops in lymph or blood vessels, and usually appears as lesions on the skin, inside of the mouth or internally.There are four types of the disease; epidemic, or AIDS-associated, KS is the most common in sub-Saharan Africa and is AIDS-defining. That means when someone with the HIV virus is diagnosed with KS, they officially have AIDS.Early detection leads to better outcomes, but that's not always possible in the developing world, where pathological testing can take one to two weeks.TINY performs loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for nucleic acid quantification. That requires heating the sample to 154 degrees, which necessitates a power source.One of the main benefits of TINY is that it can collect and store heat generated from electricity, the sun or even a Bunsen burner, and will function even during temporary power disruption, of which three occurred during testing in Uganda TINY's power flexibility is important because in many sub-Saharan African countries healthcare facilities lack access to reliable electricity.For the study, researchers collected biopsy samples from 71 patients in Uganda suspected of having KS and tested the samples with TINY as well as via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the current standard for nucleic acid quantification.Agreement between TINY and qPCR was 94 per cent (67 of 71), and the team showed that all disagreement stemmed from assay limitations and not TINY capability.Not only can TINY be carried to remote locations for point-of-care use, it could also be valuable in clinics and hospitals where electric power can be unreliable.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/tiny-portable-device-can-quickly-detect-cancer/articleshow/65912027.cms
India eyes 100% switch from disposable to reuse prevention syringes by 2020,India News: LUCKNOW: India has pledged to replace the currently prevalent disposable injections with reuse prevention (RUP) syringes by 2020.,,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"LUCKNOW: India has pledged to replace the currently prevalent disposable injections with reuse prevention (RUP) syringes by 2020. ""Setting targets under the National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme, which was launched in July this year, the Indian health ministry had pledged to achieve 100% usage of engineered safety devices to curtail injection related infections,"" said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, National Professional Officer, universal health coverage, WHO-India. He was in the city to speak at a workshop with Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences faculty and staff on safety-engineered syringes. Organised by SGPGI's gastroentrology department, which is also WHO Collaborating Centre for Viral Hepatitis, the workshop aimed at creating awareness on the issue of hepatitis. To note, RUP is a kind of safety engineered syringe which becomes redundant after one use. It is better than the prevalent disposable injections which can be re-used easily if not disposed correctly. Reuse of such syringes is associated with a number of diseases including hepatitis and HIV among others. ""Use of unsafe syringes is a major risk factor for hepatitis B and C. The switch from so-called disposable syringes will help in bringing down prevalence of hepatitis B and C by 30-35%,"" added Dr Lahariya. This is crucial considering that about 1.34 crore Indians suffer with hepatitis-C infection while an equal number carry hepatitis B. Unsafe use of injections is associated with a number of other diseases ranging from simple absys to HIV. In 2002-03, Indian government got a survey on usage of injections done. The only survey of its kind revealed that two-third of the syringes being used in India was unsafe. Experts believe that proportion of unsafe injections could have come down following adoption of auto-disable syringes in the national routine immunisation programme. But the extent of the problem still remains big as (according to 2002 study) average usage of syringes per person per year in India is 2.9. This translates into use of 350 - 400 crore injections in the country. ""The disease burden of problems like hepatitis and HIV stand self-explained considering that 50-65% of the injections are unsafe,"" said Dr Amit Goel, associated professor, gastroentrology, SGPGI. Senior faculty, gastroentrology, SGPGI, Prof Rakesh Aggarwal stated that in wake of these current scenario, investment in prevention of viral hepatitis by promotion of safety engineered syringes is public interest. ""Investment in prevention of a disease is always much lower than the amount that goes in treatment and rehabilitation,"" he said. NHM UP misses crucial policy event Besides causing viral hepatitis, use of unsafe syringes was associated with transmission of HIV. As per WHO, 33,877 persons contracted HIV because of unsafe injections across the world every year. In February last, indiscriminate use of a single injection in many persons by a quack in Unnao was associated with diagnosis of HIV positive in 45 persons in a village. But while Punjab has already adopted RUP syringes, UP is yet to start. On Thursday in fact, officials from UP's National Health Mission skipped the crucial policy orientation event. ""As for now, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh are the only Indian states to have begun the process of discarding the disposable syringes. But other states, particularly Uttar Pradesh join, India cannot achieve the target,"" he said.
