869 diagnosed with HIV in the country this year,"A total of 869 people affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) were identified in Bangladesh so far this year, according to a recent government survey.",,2018-12-02,The Daily Star,"A total of 869 people affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) were identified in Bangladesh so far this year, according to a recent government survey. The survey, conducted by the National AIDS/STD Programme of the health and welfare ministry found that of the affected, 148 have already succumbed to this fatal virus which leads to AIDS. The findings were unveiled yesterday at a programme organised by the health ministry at the Krishibid Institution Bangladesh (KIB) in Dhaka to mark World AIDS Day (December 1). The survey also said that the countrys first HIV infected patient was identified in 1989. Since then, a total of 6,455 HIV infected people were identified in the country. Of them, 1,022 people have died of the disease, said the survey. Speaking at the event, Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammed Nasim assured that Bangladesh would be able to achieve the goal of eradicating AIDS from the country by the year 2030. Regarding the spread of HIV through people who inject drugs, he said awareness is a necessity to keep the youth from drug addiction. He sought cooperation from the home ministry in this regard. Speaking at the programme, Edouard Beigbeder, country representative of Unicef Bangladesh, urged the government to increase healthcare coverage, particularly regarding HIV/AIDS, among vulnerable people. Asadul Islam, a secretary of the health ministry; and Shamiul Islam, line director of the AIDS/STD Programme; also spoke at the programme. 374 AIDS PATIENTS BEING TREATED AT CMCH As many as 61 persons have been diagnosed with HIV virus in Chattogram district this year, speakers said at a programme yesterday. They were addressing a seminar jointly organised by Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH) and its dermatology department marking World AIDS Day. At present, 374 HIV/AIDS patients are undergoing treatment at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy Corner in CMCHs Dermatology Department, while 16 others are being treated at a care centre run by a non-government organisation in the port city. Four HIV patients have died in CMCH this year, while one died in the care centre, speakers also said. Prof Dr Serajul Islam, former head of Dermatology Department of CMCH and president of Bangladesh Dermatologist Society, blamed the Rohingya community for the threat of AIDS epidemic in greater Chattogram region. “The Rohingya refugees must be confined in their camps to restrict HIV/AIDS from spreading in the country”, he said. CMCH Director Brig Gen Mohsen Uddin Ahmed and Head of CMCH Dermatology Dept Rafiqul Mawla were present among others.",{},"['patients', 'virus', 'health', 'dermatology', 'country', 'programme', 'hiv', 'diagnosed', 'cmch', 'aids', 'ministry', 'bangladesh', '869']","A total of 869 people affected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) were identified in Bangladesh so far this year, according to a recent government survey.

Like a phoenix: living with HIV for 32 years,"It was the hottest day of summer Europe ever experienced in the the last 40 years and I was eagerly waiting to meet Mr. Haerry David from Switzerland, co-author for www.hivrestrictions.org.",,2018-11-18,The Daily Star,"It was the hottest day of summer Europe ever experienced in the the last 40 years and I was eagerly waiting to meet Mr. Haerry David from Switzerland, co-author for www.hivrestrictions.org. We were there to talk about decriminalisation and restrictions on people living with HIV in many countries. Haerry David has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for the last 32 years. He is a survivor living with HIV for the highest number of years, ever encountered by me. Surprisingly, I found Bangladesh besides the Middle East, China and Malaysia, who deport HIV infected people as soon as they are detected during their stay, and puts restriction on any kind of visit for those who are already detected. So I decided to share Davids story to know more about HIV with breaking barriers and building bridges in his own words. “The result was positive. It took me six months to make up my mind and I went to the hospital for screening”, said Mr Haerry. “Two to three years, maybe more, maybe less”, my physician told me about my life expectancy. They wanted to give me antiretroviral medication with very bad side effects. I walked away from the premises with many uncertainties. Later on, I focused on my career and until I fell very sick in 1996. I was losing hope as I lost 30 kgs rapidly, having Kaposi sarcoma along with atypical tuberculosis. In 1996 specific treatment for HIV arrived which worked really well for me. I managed my way facing so many side effects and today I have an advanced regime of Integrase inhibitors, Nevirapine and Abacavir. After my diagnosis was made positive, I worked for 10 years like a normal person but quit my job in 1996. I worked while I already had HIV and at the time had an entry restriction to the USA and I had to go there twice a year as a Swiss businessman. I was very nervous while I was receiving treatments. I started repacking my treatment as vitamins to get customs clearance. When I could not work anymore, I said to my friends that we should establish a database of the countries where we are not allowed to travel. That is when a database was established. So far we have touched a few landmarks. The most prominent government that repealed the restrictions was USA, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. We believe the person with or without HIV should have access to the health system in the country where s/he lives, like anybody else who has any kind of health issue. If you have diabetes and you go abroad, you are treated abroad. So people with HIV should be treated the same. As the world is fighting against HIV and striving to eliminate HIV by the year 2030, we all should take efforts in eliminating the stigmas and treat people with HIV with equal rights just like other people.

London HIV patient becomes world's second AIDS cure hope,"An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors say.",,2019-03-05,The Daily Star,"An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors said. Almost three years after receiving bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after coming off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the mans previous HIV infection. ""There is no virus there that we can measure. We cant detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man. The case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, the doctors said, but does not mean a cure for HIV has been found. Gupta described his patient as ""functionally cured"" and ""in remission"", but cautioned: ""Its too early to say hes cured."" The man is being called ""the London patient"", in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV. Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free. Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients. Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called Hodgkins Lymphoma. LAST CHANCE In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him. ""This was really his last chance of survival,"" Gupta told Reuters in an interview. The donor - who was unrelated - had a genetic mutation known as CCR5 delta 32, which confers resistance to HIV. The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of ""graft-versus-host"" disease - a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipients immune cells. Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people — most of them of northern European descent — who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus. Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key - or whether the graft versus host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said. Sharon Lewin, an expert at Australias Doherty Institute and co-chair of the International AIDS Societys cure research advisory board, told Reuters the London case points to new avenues for study. ""We havent cured HIV, but (this) gives us hope that its going to be feasible one day to eliminate the virus,"" she said. Gupta said his team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. ""We need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,"" he said. The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details.",{},"['worlds', 'virus', 'known', 'patient', 'man', 'hope', 'donor', 'doctors', 'cure', 'gupta', 'hiv', 'london', 'case', 'aids', 'second']","We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

HIV deaths: Bangladesh 10th in Asia,"Bangladesh stands at the tenth position in HIV deaths among Asian countries, according to a UNAIDS report.",,2018-01-26,The Daily Star,"Bangladesh stands at the tenth position in HIV deaths among Asian countries, according to a UNAIDS report. Bangladesh lost around 1,000 people in 2016 due to AIDS, says the report. Whereas, India has the highest number of deaths in Asia as per the report. The disease claimed 62,000 lives in India in the same year. Even as AIDS related deaths have declined in Asia, the disease continues to claim lives throughout the region. In 2016, there were estimated 170,000 AIDS-related fatalities in the Asia Pacific region, down from 240,000 in 2010. According to the UNAIDS report 2017, an estimated 5.1 million in the Asia Pacific region are living with HIV while only 2.4 million have access to treatment. Since data on China is not available. India remains the country with the third largest population of people with HIV after South Africa and Nigeria. In China, the number of people affected by HIV has been estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million. However, there is no data available in the report about people who died of AIDS-related illnesses. Indonesia lost 38,000 in 2016 to due to the disease. While the new HIV infections saw a decrease, the country has seen an increase in the number of AIDS related deaths. Thailand has the third highest AIDS related death rate in Asia. With 16,000 people dying due to the disease in 2016, the country launched a new national strategy in 2017 to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2023. With fourth highest death rate in Asia, 8,000 people died in Vietnam in 2016 due to the disease. The country has seen a steady decline in the number of new infections as well as deaths. Myanmar and Malaysia lost 7,800 and 7,000 people respectively due to the disease in 2016. Pakistan saw 5,500 people lose their lives due to AIDS in 2016. The number of deaths has been rising steadily along with the number of new infection cases in the country. In Cambodia and Nepal, the disease took lives of 1800 and 1700 people respectively. Bangladesh lost an estimated 1,000 people in 2016 due to AIDS. There has been a slight increase in the number of new infections as well as number of deaths due to the disease. However, overall Bangladesh remains low HIV-prevalence country. Philippines and Laos have less than a thousand and five hundred people dying of the disease respectively. Philippines has seen a significant rise in the number of new infections while as the statistics for Laos have not changed much from a last couple of years. With much lower number of new infections and deaths compared to its South Asian neigbours Sri Lanka has seen less than 200 deaths due to the disease in 2016. Mongolia has the least number of deaths due to the disease with less than 100 people. The country hasn’t seen a significant change in AIDS related cases since past one decade.

Living with HIV: a fight to the death,"Little Akib was in the last stages of advanced AIDS. A boy of 12, he looked six years old and was all skin and bones. He breathed his last on Sunday night. “He was fine this morning, talking and getting ready. I fed him as usual,” said his nani.",,2017-12-01,The Daily Star,"Little Akib was in the last stages of advanced AIDS. A boy of 12, he looked six years old and was all skin and bones. He breathed his last on Sunday night. “He was fine this morning, talking and getting ready. I fed him as usual,” said his nani. She has now watched both her daughter and her grandson die of the deadly disease that is AIDS. Akib was diagnosed almost three years ago. He wouldnt let it get him down though. Akib would come himself, every month or so, all the way from Gazipur where he lived with his grandmother, to collect his medicine from the hospital in Dhaka. “Whereas I should be the one bringing him for treatment, he would bring me, because he knows his way around the city and knows his letters,” said his grandmother. Akib lay beside her, unable to talk or move. His mother had died of AIDS two years ago and his father too has advanced AIDS. Two months ago, he caught tuberculosis (TB) as well and this, in addition to the HIV virus, combined to weaken him substantially. For those with HIV, the immune system is suppressed, making it harder to fight off other infections. TB is responsible for the most deaths among people with HIV. His counsellor at Ashar Alo Society (a local NGO), Azhar Hossain, says that Akib should have been hospitalised after he caught TB. A wilful child, however, Akib refused to stay in the hospital and would always go back to his grandmother. “We couldnt enforce that he took the TB or the antiretroviral (ARV) medication regularly at home. Try as we would, he just wouldnt stay at the hospital,” said Hossain. Of the 11,700 adults and children presently living with HIV in Bangladesh (as of 2016), only 2,475 are on ARV therapy. Many remain unaware of their HIV-positive status. Within the last year, almost 1,000 died as a result of AIDS and new infections amounted to 1,500. The figures for this year will be released by the government today, December 1—World AIDS Day. Stigma runs deep There remains a silence around the virus and disease and stigma runs deep, even among the HIV-positive themselves as well as in the medical community. Internalised stigma among those living with HIV/AIDS is not uncommon. A study by UNAIDS, Plan International, BRAC and others found that 68 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) felt ashamed and 54 percent felt guilty due to their HIV-positive status. Shame and guilt hinder their participation in social activities and lead to withdrawal from their communities. More worryingly, it can prevent them from going to the hospital for treatment. The same study found that 17.1 percent of males and 16.3 percent of females surveyed would not visit the hospital even when they needed to—to collect their medicines or to avail treatment—as a result of internalised stigma. Equally worrying is stigma from healthcare workers. PLHA are further discouraged from seeking treatment because of discrimination they face at hospitals and clinics. In a 2010 study which surveyed doctors, nurses, medical technicians and support staff, the results proved troubling. 47.9 percent of healthcare workers felt that those who have HIV/AIDS should not be allowed to mix freely with other people. A breakdown reveals that 21.9 percent of doctors, 48.1 percent of nurses and an overwhelming 83.3 percent of support staff felt this way. With direct caregivers displaying such attitudes, it is of little surprise that patients are discouraged from seeking out treatment. Testing and treatment are free. As are ARV drugs, which are distributed by the government and, until recently, by a few non-government organisations. PLHAs, especially those diagnosed late, require these medicines every day, for the rest of their lives. They can lead healthy lives as long as they take ARV drugs to control the infection and prevent transmitting the virus to others. The recent change in the distribution of the free ARV medication is a complication. Earlier, patients would get their drugs from NGOs and self-help groups, such as Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash Bangladesh, and Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP). These organisations have been working to provide counselling, psychosocial and medical support to PLHA across the country. Most of the staff themselves are people living with HIV. Since October this year, these drugs are now being distributed from six major hospitals around the country, including Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Dhaka. It however means that patients come from as far away as Comilla to get their supply of medicines once every two months. Sherin Akter says her husband, a businessman, is threatening to stop going to the hospital to pick up his HIV medication as the process is time-consuming and a hassle. Sherin and her husband are both HIV-positive and were diagnosed 11 years ago. The trouble is not just the usual troubles associated with accessing services at government hospitals. It is that the hospital environment itself is not hospitable for those with HIV/AIDS. Sherin, for example, went for a routine eye exam at BSMMU just last week but was forced to disclose her HIV-positive status to the doctor and nurse, crammed in with five other patients in the doctors room. Whether or not to disclose her HIV-positive status in light of the discriminatory attitudes towards PLHA is not a light dilemma. Sherin disclosed it, thinking that her doctor ought to know before examining her. “It was so embarrassing, the doctor and nurse just stared for a long time, dumbstruck as to what to do. Everyone else was also staring at me,” she said. 34-year-old Sherin has not yet informed her own family, except her younger sister, of her and her husbands HIV status. Her in-laws found out a few years ago when her husband was severely sick and had to be hospitalised. “It took them a while, but they soon came to terms with the situation,” she says. Their only daughter, 14, doesnt yet know. Sherin and her husband have discussed it, but feel that she should be a little older when she finds out that both her parents are HIV-positive. “We plan on telling her once she completes her HSC exams,” says Sherin. Sherin and her husband have faced discriminatory attitudes at hospitals. They have been denied or reluctantly given treatment at least four times because hospitals and doctors are not prepared to treat HIV-positive patients. Remaining silent about their status in public life is a given here, but should they also have to suffer stigma in a place where they are supposed to receive care? Holistic care needed As important as the medicine, is the counselling and psycho-social support required by PLHIV. Dr Saima Khan, UNAIDS country manager for Bangladesh, says “Four things are of essence—confidentiality, access to medicine and services, acceptance of their situation, and help in coping with their families.” Though one of these functions has now shifted to the government, the others remain lacking. Even in the case of medication, they may very well be free but there are hidden costs involved. There are only six hospitals across the country giving out free medicines, testing and treatment. Patients come from afar and are sometimes forced to turn back that day with no medicine or treatment as doctors are not available at all times and there is no privacy for PLHA. Given these challenges, the transition to a public distribution system should have been better thought out, feels Hafizuddin Munna, president of the PLHIV (persons living with HIV) network. The logic was that the public system is already equipped to handle hundreds of thousands of patients. Why shouldnt it be able to provide treatment to a few thousand? Hafizuddin worries that the government will not be able to provide comprehensive care in relation to the unique challenges PLHA face. “Service providers are generally not trained to be sensitive. And people in our country are already reluctant to access government healthcare,” he says. The service used to be available locally, with NGOs often paying home visits. Now, patients have to makes trips to the hospital. “The service needs to be incentivised,” says Hafizuddin. Dr Belal Hossain, deputy director and programme manager of the national AIDS/STS programme says however, “There has been no problem so far in service delivery. The system is very much the same as before, with PLHA being given two months worth of medicine and confidentiality being maintained.” Dr Belal says that the shift from the NGOs to government had been anticipated earlier and the transition happened smoothly. But as Akibs case illustrates, just providing medicines is not enough. For Akib, who lost his mother, more care was needed than just telling him to come pick up his medicines. He needed care that went beyond. If he had had that, maybe he wouldnt have left this world at the tender age of 12.",{},"['status', 'plha', 'death', 'hiv', 'hivpositive', 'living', 'hospital', 'hospitals', 'fight', 'akib', 'medicines', 'treatment', 'patients']","For those with HIV, the immune system is suppressed, making it harder to fight off other infections.

Why the HIV epidemic is not over,1 December 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day – a day created to raise awareness about HIV and the resulting AIDS epidemics.,,2018-12-02,The Daily Star,"1 December 2018 marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day – a day created to raise awareness about HIV and the resulting AIDS epidemics. Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have acquired the infection, and about 35 million people have died. Today, around 37 million worldwide live with HIV, of whom 22 million are on treatment. This December is the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day, with the theme: “Know Your Status”. When World AIDS Day was first established in 1988, the world looked very different to how it is today. Now, we have easily accessible testing, treatment, a range of prevention options, including pre-exposure prophylaxis, and services that can reach vulnerable communities. The effort to develop effective treatment for HIV is remarkable in its speed and success. Clinical trials of antiretrovirals (ARVs) began in 1985 – the same year that the first HIV test was approved – and the first ARV was approved for use in 1987. However, a single drug was found to have only short-term benefits. By 1995, ARVs were being prescribed in various combinations. A breakthrough in the HIV response was announced to the world at the 11th International AIDS Conference in Vancouver when the success of as “highly active antiretroviral treatment” (HAART) – a combination of three ARVs reported to reduce AIDS-related deaths by between 60% and 80%. Because of the high cost of ARVs, most low- and middle-income countries could not afford to provide treatment through their public programmes. World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the ‘3 by 5‘ initiative with the aim of providing HIV treatment to 3 million people in low- and middle-income countries by 2005. The 3 by 5 initiative was the most ambitious public health programme ever launched, which would increase 15-fold the number of people receiving life-saving treatment in some of the poorest countries of the world, in just three years. In 2015, WHO recommended the use of ARVs to prevent HIV acquisition – pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP – for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk. HIV is not an easy virus to defeat. Nearly a million people still die every year from the virus because they do not know they have HIV and are not on treatment, or they start treatment late. This is despite WHO guidelines in 2015 recommending that all people living with HIV should receive antiretroviral treatment, regardless of their immune status and stage of infection, and as soon as possible after their diagnosis. One of the biggest challenges in the HIV response has remained unchanged for 30 years: HIV disproportionally affects people in vulnerable populations that are often highly marginalised and stigmatised. Thus, most new HIV infections and deaths are seen in places where certain higher-risk groups remain unaware, underserved or neglected. The theme of this World AIDS Day – Know Your Status – is important. One in four people with HIV do not know that they have HIV. To bridge some critical gaps in the availability of HIV tests, WHO recommends the use of self-tests for HIV. WHO first recommended HIV self-testing in 2016, and now more than 50 countries have developed policies on self-testing. This World AIDS Day, WHO and the International Labour Organisation also announced new guidance to support companies and organisations to offer HIV self-tests in workplace.

193 tested HIV positive in 8 southern districts: Report,"At least 193 people have been tested HIV positive in the country's eight southern districts, says a report released by a local voluntary organisation.",,2018-09-30,The Daily Star,"At least 193 people have been tested HIV positive in the countrys eight southern districts, says a report released by a local voluntary organisation. Among the affected people, 84 (53 men and 31 women) have been tested HIV positive in Khulna district alone while 109 in Jhenidah, Gopalganj, Jashore, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Narail, and Magura districts, according to Mukto Akash Bangladesh (MAB), the voluntary organisation that works on AIDS-related issues. Contacted, Civil Surgeon of Khulna Dr Abdur Razzak told UNB that they cross-checked the findings released by MAB and found those correct.

No HIV virus, the report says, was detected among sex workers of the district while a hijra (transgender) was found to be carrying HIV. The number of deaths caused by HIV is rapidly growing in the southern districts, the report mentions. It says the worst affected areas among the districts are Benapole, Chaugachha, and Khulna town as the workers of those areas frequently visit various countries, mostly India, for their works and carry back the lethal virus. In the eight districts, the MAB report reveals, at least 59 people died of AIDS in 14 years spanning between 2013 -2017 while the number of deaths was 12 in 2015 and 2016 together, while 12 in 2017 alone.

HIV cases on the rise in southern districts,"The prevalence of HIV/AIDS infections among people of southern districts are increasing sharply, raising health concerns in the region.",,2018-10-05,The Daily Star,"The prevalence of HIV/AIDS infections among people of southern districts are increasing sharply, raising health concerns in the region. On average, three to four new people infected with HIV are being detected every month, said officials at Khulna Medical College Hospital (KMCH). In 2015, only 8 HIV patients were detected at the hospital. But the numbers rose to 30 new patients in 2016 and 25 in 2017. “We have detected at least 32 patients infected with HIV this year so far,” said Molla Nurul Aslam, programme manager of SHS (Strengthening HIV Service) of KMCH. Almost all of the patients come from southern districts including Khulna, Jashore, Narail, Bagerhat, Satkhira, Gopalganj, Jhenaidah, Magura, Chuadanga and Faridpur. Frequent movement of labourers between Bangladesh and India, floating sex workers, unsafe blood transmission, breastfeeding by infected mothers, and lack of awareness among people are major reasons behind the spread of the disease, according to hospital officials and health rights activists. There are around 1,600 registered sex workers at different brothels in Khulna, Jashore and Bagerhat. Moreover, there are around 6,000 floating sex workers in Khulna and its surrounding districts, according to Durjoy Nari Shangha, an NGO working for welfare of sex workers. Day labourers and workers of different goods-laden vehicles who frequently travel between Bangladesh and India are mostly the clients of these sex workers, said Rehena Begum, coordinator of Mukto Akash Bangladesh, an organisation that works on HIV. Visiting the KMCH, the correspondent spoke to a number of people who were infected with HIV. “I have been a truck driver for around 17 years, and often travelled to India with goods. I have been suffering from different illnesses in the last few years. Around three months ago, I got my blood tested and found that I have been infected with HIV,” said Rahman Miah (not real name), a resident of Sharsha Upazila of Jashore. He admitted to The Daily Star that he used to go to brothels in both Bangladesh and India. Motaleb Miah (not real name), 55, a construction worker of Jashore, worked for around 15 years in India since 2015, and returned home a few years ago. He started suffering from various types of diseases since then. In July this year, he came to the KMCH for a blood test, and was diagnosed with HIV. Subsequently, His wife and one of his daughters were also detected HIV positive. They are now undergoing treatment at the hospital. Apart from physical sickness and mental distress, HIV-infected people are often subject to social stigma. “Local people beat me up mercilessly after they came to know that my wife, daughter and I are infected with HIV. They forbade me from leaving my house and fetching water from local tube-well. We could not use the village pond,” said Motaleb. “Even two of my other daughters who are not infected with HIV have been forbidden from going to school,” he stated.. KMCH is running several programmes to combat HIV, including Strengthening HIV Service (SHS), Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) and Peer Counselor of ART (Anti Retro Viral Therapy), said the hospital officials. Currently, some 208 HIV patients are being treated from ART at KMCH, hospital officials said. Dr ATM Monzur Morshed, Superintendent of KMCH, told The Daily Star that government is working hard to detect HIV patients and provide treatment free of cost, as well as to raise awareness among people to prevent transmission of the disease. Along with the government, several NGOs are working in the region to prevent HIV, he said.",{},"['workers', 'cases', 'kmch', 'rise', 'india', 'districts', 'infected', 'khulna', 'hiv', 'hospital', 'sex', 'detected', 'southern', 'patients']","In 2015, only 8 HIV patients were detected at the hospital. “We have detected at least 32 patients infected with HIV this year so far,” said Molla Nurul Aslam, programme manager of SHS (Strengthening HIV Service) of KMCH.

"Stigma, discrimination and HIV/AIDS",,,2013-12-14,The Daily Star,"I am HIV positive. Few of my close friends know about my HIV status. At first I told it to my wife. After knowing my HIV status, her behavior towards me was very discriminatory. My wife suspects me. The day my wife came to know about my HIV status, she poured patrol all over the house. She wanted to die with our two little children that day. However, my utmost efforts prevent my wife from setting fire. My wife began to use separate bedroom, bathroom, soap and almost everything of our house. If our two children wanted to come to me, my wife would forbid them. In this way I passed two and a half years. In this period, I was totally separated from my wife and children.” said Sonjib (a pseudonym HIV-positive). In family level, many people become stigmatised and discriminated for their HIV positive status. PLWHAs (People living with HIV/AIDS) face discrimination, stigmatized behavior, social criticism and social rejection after disclosing their HIV status. In 1987 Jonathan Mann, the Director of World Health Organizations Global Program on AIDS, forecast three components to the HIV epidemic: the first would be HIV, the second AIDS, and the third would be Stigma, Discrimination and Denial. He predicted that stigma and discrimination and denial would be as central as the illness itself. UN Secretary Ban Ki Moon says: “Stigma remains the single most important barrier to public action. It is the main reason why too many people are afraid to see a doctor to determine whether they have the disease, or to seek treatment if so. It helps make AIDS the silent killer: because people fear social disgrace of speaking about it, or akin gasify available precautions.” According to our societal view, people who are infected with HIV virus are considered to be caused by sexual intercourse which is not socially sanctioned in our conservative Bangladesh. It is also not approved by religious morality. This leads to one of the barriers to curb the disclosure of their HIV-positive status. As a collectivistic society like Bangladesh, HIV-positive individual may be seen as a reflection of not only oneself but also ones family or community. Therefore, PLWHAs want to keep the information secret to avoid social criticism. AIDS is a dangerous and shameful disease to them. If it is disclosed, it will be difficult for them to sustain the family and conjugal life. Many people in our country are fearful that HIV is contagious and can be transmitted through casual link contact like holding hands and hugging. In our country, the information of HIV and AIDS sometimes misguides people. The silent surrounding of the disease and various myths, taboos and misconceptions about the disease also increase stigma among the PLWHAs. When family knows HIV status, this becomes a tale and that is why his or her respect decreases. Besides, many people hide their HIV status from their family members due to the fear of the decrease of respect. PLWHAs in our country do not disclose their status to their friends, neighbours or others, because they fear if all know their status, they will be more stigmatized and discriminated than the present. Most of the educational institutions do not allow HIV students to study at their institutions. PLWHAs suffered economically due to discrimination of losing their jobs. Stigma and discriminations are daily realities for people living with HIV. Many PLWHAs have even become the victim of the worst discrimination due to positive status. Women tend to experience greater stigma and discrimination than men in our society. They have also fewer resources for acclimatizing with this situation. In our society, women are only eyed for their household activities and reproductive activity. Adolescent girls are forced into early marriage because of unequal access to education, empowerment and decision making rights. Women are forced to engage in unprotected sex due to their powerlessness in decision-making. In most of the cases, married women are infected with the virus by their husbands. Self or internal stigma is another important fact that forces many of the PLWHAs to feel guilty and shame for their status. Self or internal stigma is an ongoing phenomenon that places a social burden and barrier on PLWHAs. PLWHAs feel isolated, guilty, dirty and full of shame. Many PLWHAs perceive AIDS as a moral punishment for them. They often believe to deserve their illness because they have done something “wrong”. We are now frequently having meetings, round tables, debates that might teach us some lessons but we do not discuss about HIV/AIDS related stigma and discrimination. It is one of the major hidden reasons for why people are not interested to test HIV. In addition, this is why most possibly in near future HIV/AIDS will be the silent killer to aggravate the situation of Bangladesh. People of our country look this disease as a “curse of God” or as a “punishment for bad behavior”. People are afraid to come forward to be tested for HIV. The fear of stigma and discrimination makes them hide that they are HIV positive. HIV positive individuals, their relatives, friends, their most close ones and even the doctors are reluctant to give them proper care and support when they need the support most. They may be forced out from their homes, jobs, educational institutions and even from society. In the United States, HIV confidentiality guidelines recommend that health professionals should not divulge personal information to others in ways inconsistent with the clients original consent (United States Centers for Disease Control, 1999). But in our country we have no effective rules regarding this issue. The risk behavior of HIV/AIDS is deteriorating in our neighboring countries like Myanmar, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Bangladesh is in a better position, but not out of danger. According to National AIDS Committee (2006) 7500 person are living with HIV nationwide. Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition estimates that HIV/AIDS remains at less than 1% amongst most at risk populations. The number of current positive population in Bangladesh is not significant at this moment but the important issue is that the numbers are steadily increasing. Female and male sex workers, IDUs (Injecting Drug Users), migrated workers, transgender persons are very risky population for the transmission of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is in a vulnerable zone due to high transmission rate of HIV in our neighbouring country India. Indian efforts have failed to address the issue of stigma and discrimination and negative attitudes towards the PLWHAs in their policy. As a result, PLWHAs try to hide their status to everyone, even to their life partners due to social ostracisms. Various measures, plans, programs and policies have been taken by both government and non-government organizations to reduce the outbreak of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. Various policies have been successfully implemented but the matters of stigma and discrimination of HIV/AIDS patients have not come on focus or upwards with the importance in the discussion or have not yet been included in the policy. So it is high time to rectify our behavior towards the PLWHAs. If we will be able to reduce the fear of stigma and discrimination of HIV/AIDS patients, patients will come to test for HIV and it will be possible for us to resist the outbreak of this fatal disease. We should increase the religious morality and teachings which will be a safeguard for the involvement of highly risky behavior. We should not maltreat the PLWHAs. They have the right to get good behavior from the mass people. They have the right to get medical treatment and the right to get personal support and care from their family and friends. State should not violate their human rights. We should not maltreat them in a way that they are forced to accept death before their inevitable death. We should increase positive attitudes among the people towards HIV/AIDS patients and reduce the prejudices against this disease.

People with HIV shocked by data leak in Singapore,"The revelation that the personal information of 14,200 people with HIV was leaked has stunned people living with the virus in Singapore.",,2019-01-30,The Daily Star,"The revelation that the personal information of 14,200 people with HIV was leaked has stunned people living with the virus in Singapore. People like 45-year-old Mr G. Chew told The Straits Times on Monday (Jan 28) that the leak has risked both his personal and professional reputation. ""My company is of course aware that I have HIV, and I am fairly open about it to well-meaning friends who ask me about my illness out of genuine concern,"" said Mr Chew, an administrative officer who has been contacted by the Ministry of Health (MOH) that he was affected by the data leak. ""However, I definitely fear that all this personal information might be publicly available to people at my workplace and beyond to scrutinise. Also, its the Internet - once its up there and shared over and over, its inerasable. ""There is still a great stigma against people who have HIV. Information that I have HIV is definitely not something I want online. Its not like its an award."" Meanwhile, when Jay (not his real name), who is in his 20s, heard news of the leak, his first thought was of his 60-year-old mother and the harassment and judgment she could face from family and friends. ""Having HIV is to me an embarrassing thing and definitely an extremely private matter,"" Jay told the ST, adding that only one close friend had known about his illness. He was diagnosed around 2011 which means he is among the affected individuals though he has not been contacted by MOH. ""I have not told my mother about it, and I dont intend to. I have accepted that AIDS is what I have to live with forever, but I am afraid that if this information is made public, that my family and close friends will be ostracised and laughed at."" MOH revealed that some 1,900 names in the leaked data were of people who had already died. Ms C. Koh, 31, said she suspects her late brother, who was diagnosed in 2008 and died of HIV-related medical complications in 2016, might be on the list. She said she hopes her family would also receive advice from MOH on what to do if their deceased family member’s data has indeed been leaked. ""After my brother passed, my father and I thought that this situation could be put to bed. We are very concerned that his data - including our home address - might be spread online by malicious people,"" Ms Koh said. ""This is opening old wounds for us, and the idea that my late brothers personal data is, even now, not secure, is very disturbing. We want to know why people like him are being targeted."" In a statement on Monday night, advocacy group Action for Aids (AFA) said it is deeply troubled by the incident which it said could damage the lives of persons living with HIV and their loved ones. ""We stand with all whose private information may have been accessed and violated. This is a criminal act that should be condemned and answered in the most severe terms possible."" AFA president Roy Chan said. Professor Chan urged the public to refrain from sharing the leaked details if they come across such information. ""We understand that this is a trying time for the many who are affected by this breach, and we would like to express our solidarity as a community that have been affected by HIV,"" he added.",{},"['personal', 'shocked', 'singapore', 'leak', 'leaked', 'definitely', 'information', 'hiv', 'data', 'thought', 'family', 'affected', 'told']","The revelation that the personal information of 14,200 people with HIV was leaked has stunned people living with the virus in Singapore.

Fear of HIV spread grows,Health officials in Cox's Bazar fear spread of HIV/AIDS in the refugee camps as a rising number of Rohingyas have been diagnosed with the disease.,,2017-10-11,The Daily Star,"Health officials in Coxs Bazar fear spread of HIV/AIDS in the refugee camps as a rising number of Rohingyas have been diagnosed with the disease. So far, 19 patients, mostly males, have been identified. One of them died since the Rohingya influx began on August 25, according to Coxs Bazar Civil Surgeon office. More than five lakh Rohingyas have fled violence in Rakhine State of Myanmar into Bangladesh that was already hosting over 3 lakh Rohingyas before the recent influx. The refugees live in congested camps in the countrys south-eastern district. Shaheen Md Abdur Rahman Chowdhury, residential medical officer of Coxs Bazar Sadar Hospital, said 16 AIDS patients had been brought under treatment. Having seen the number of such patients increasing, the health ministry provided 300 kits to detect HIV patients at the upazila level in Ukhia and Tekhaf, he told The Daily Star. Doctors, nurses, pathologists and technicians are being trained in how to use the kits and safety measures, he added. According to the UNAIDS, 2.3 lakh people are living with HIV in Myanmar, and 7,800 people died due to the infection. Myanmar is one of the 35 countries witnessing 90 percent of new HIV infections globally. Preferring not to be named, a gynaecologist working for an international organisation in Ukhia said the actual picture would be dreadful. “In the field level, we dont have any mechanism to detect HIV patients. We refer those who have symptoms of HIV to the district hospital for confirmation.” Though the HIV positive patients seem to be low in number, the risk of spreading of the infection is very high, the gynaecologist said, fearing a rapid spread of the contagious disease if steps were not taken immediately. Health personnel working in the refugee camps said most of the Rohingya people were not covered by vaccination and so their immune system was comparatively weak. Besides, their hygiene practices are not up to the mark, while many of them maintain ""risky sexual behaviour"". Misbah Uddin Ahmed, Ukhia Upazila health and family planning officer, said six Rohingya people were identified as HIV positive at his hospital. “Myanmar is one of the countries in the world where HIV/AIDS is endemic. Rohingyas are not excluded. We never know how many Rohingya people are HIV infected and how many of them entered Bangladesh,” he said. Ahmed also said HIV tests were being conducted in delivery cases at his health complex. “We have taken various measures to identify HIV positive patients and vulnerable patients. The situation is still under control,” Abdus Salam, civil surgeon of Coxs Bazar, said. Abul Kalam Azad, director general of the Directorate General of Health Services, said a team of national HIV programme was already in Coxs Bazar and was working to identify HIV patients. “We are providing treatment once they are detected....We will not go for mass screening for HIV detection. It is not required. We will screen only those vulnerable to the disease. According to the health ministry, 4,143 Bangladeshis, one of the lowest in the world, have been found to be HIV-positive so far and 658 patients have died.",{},"['spread', 'grows', 'health', 'positive', 'rohingya', 'coxs', 'working', 'hiv', 'fear', 'rohingyas', 'ukhia', 'bazar', 'patients']","Health officials in Cox's Bazar fear spread of HIV/AIDS in the refugee camps as a rising number of Rohingyas have been diagnosed with the disease. “In the field level, we don't have any mechanism to detect HIV patients.

Prevention Of Hiv In Bangladesh,,,2013-12-01,The Daily Star,"Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque, UNFPA Todays roundtable is part of our continuous advocacy in relation to HIV and SRH (Sexual and Reproductive Health). There is a key theme in the title: policy strategic plan and integration between human health and HIV. A question might be raised that why are we embarking on this issue? First, if we can integrate SRH and HIV, it will ensure the financial sustainability of the programme in relation to SRH and HIV. Secondly, integration will increase the coverage of the programme in terms of geographic and per capita coverage. It will improve quality of services and reduce stigma discriminations in relation to HIV and SRH. These are the main purposes of integration of SRH and HIV. Let me give some examples of possible integration of HIV and SRH: 1. Transmission from mother to child is one of the ways of HIV transmission. If we consider maternal health and do integration of maternal health and HIV, there would be less risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. For example, if a mother is found HIV positive, she would be counseled for ARV and special services to reduce the risk of transmission. That is one justification for integration of HIV and maternal health. 2. Second example is of dual protection. Condom is used as a dual protection method: family planning and prevention of HTI and HIV. If we consider our programme area in relation to family planning and HIV, my understanding and experience say that these two programs are being implemented in a vertical fashion. HIV programme and family planning programme are doing the same condom promotion programme but in an incoherent manner. If we can integrate the HIV with the reproductive health, the large number of field workers of family planning programme can easily disseminate the little message about HIV in a short period of time to a large group of population. 3. If we can integrate the migration issue with the HIV, this can also reduce the risk of transmission as the person can take extra precaution during his stay outside the country. 4. The fourth is very common but not much talked about: the child marriage issue in relation to HIV. In a child marriage, the girl does not have any negotiation skill with her sexual partner. This can also increase the risk of transmission. We need to think how the child marriage issue can be related to HIV to prevent further transmission. 5. Fifth one is gender based violence and violence in general. For instance, gender discrimination and gender inequality actually disempower female counter part and she does not have any negotiation power over sex. If there is social and economical empowerment, the female counterpart will have a definite say for safe sex practice. These are the justifications why we have invited you. We want to have your insights regarding why we need such integration of HIV with the reproductive health. Please allow me to read the Toto Policy statement regarding this issue: 1. To device a national program, 2. To prevent and contain the spread of HIV infection as a part of Bangladeshs health system, 3. To involve all the government sectors and relevant government/non-government organizations to the fullest extent possible in planning, implementation of such program in conformity with global strategy. So, we have a strong justification why we need integration of HIV and SRH. Integration of HIV and SRH is very much related to our National AIDS STD Programme (NASP) which is endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In the third objective it says, “To strengthen the coordination mechanism and management capacity at different levels to ensure an effective multi-sector HIV response”. In the strategies and plans of the same document, it says that the multi-sector engagement of the HIV epidemic is very complex. It is felt across the society involving individuals, families, sectors and institutions. It, therefore, goes beyond the domain of the heath sectors and an effective response to it must be multi-sectoral. So, if I again refer back to the title, we have a very strong ground and documented justification in relation to policy document and strategic plan. It clearly asks for integration of HIV and reproductive health program. Despite clear policy guidance and our commitment, we are still doing the HIV and reproductive health programmes in a discrete fashion. It is also important to integrate our funds for HIV and SRH. If a donor only funds for HIV then it is really difficult for the implementing agency to go beyond the donors mandate. So our donors have to be aware of the issue of integration. Without administrative and financial integration support, implementation of integrated programmes cannot be successful. Though we have large fund being provided for HIV, still there are gaps. To fill the gaps, we can integrate the services of the other sectors. For example, we can integrate health, education, gender, population and so on. I agree, this is a low prevalent country and unlike Africa and the other high prevalent countries, the integration is not so important. But we need to integrate HIV and SRH to continue the low prevalence effectively. And the integration programme should be mainstreamed. Dr. Halidah Khandaker, Executive Director, Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAAP) In 1995/96, AIDS Committee developed a strategy. There was an indication for integration of HIV/AIDS with STD (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) prevention. Although there was no mention of MCH (Maternal and Child Health), STD was one of the features. The strategy had four objectives: 1. Prevention of transmission of HIV; 2. Reduce the impact of HIV infection; 3. Prevention of STD; 4. Management of STD. I do not know how it was separated again and why it did not work. From the observation, age and experience with many departments of obstetric gynecology, STD and HIV infection I can say integration has many good sides, especially for women. Because, if a woman gets chance to get all the services from one place, for her it becomes beneficial to come and take the services. As you know, women are always neglected and they hardly get any chance to come to hospital or come to take other services, except during delivery or pregnancy. About that also I am very doubtful because most of the deliveries are being done at home than in the center. So, in that case, when a woman gets chance to have MCH services, she can get the services of STD also. And if she can also get the services of detection for HIV also, then she can get three or four services from one place. That will reduce her husbands burden to bring her to the hospital repeatedly. It will also reduce the cost of healthcare. As HIV and STD spread almost by the same method of sexual transmission, the prevention is also the same. For instance, a woman can ask her husband to use condom to have less children. So, then she will have good health and will have a reduced chance of getting HIV infection from her husband or vice versa. Condom promotion can help this. This is not only beneficial for women, but for men also, because they are the ones who will be providing the sustenance for their wives and children. I want to urge our authorities to integrate HIV especially with MCH. Because when a woman cannot get the chance to detect if she is positive or negative, she can come to the MCH centre. She will have some blood test and during that time she can have the HIV test also. So, that becomes very easy for her to get to know the status. And when she knows the status, she can get the chance of having the condom; have fewer children and less infection. She may not be infected at all, or the child may not be infected at all. You can make conditions like “I have told you before.” And the other thing is that it is mans responsibility to spare or reduce the chance of infection, i.e. by using condom. So HIV should be integrated with family planning also. And my idea is to integrate the three services: HIV, STD and Family Planning. Only one condom can save many lives. So, why will men be reluctant? I am not a feminist. I am a mother, a wife and I love my husband and my children. I love my family and I wanted to be a house-wife which I do love. Still, this is true that men have to realize. I may not ask my husband whether he is having affair with other lady but I should have the courage to speak it out some other way. If the husband becomes responsible then I will tell him that, “I do not care how many women you are having affairs with; but when you have affairs with me then please use the condom.” I think, the men here would agree with me.

Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque There is some confusion about the integration issue. One clinic is doing the STI (sexually transmitted infections) services and they are also providing the HIV services. They say that they are doing integration. We are not here to discuss that issue actually; we are saying the integration in relation to the mainstream and linkage. Since we do not have policy, strategic, management, administrative and financial support for the integration programme from the centre level, it will be very sporadic and it will have minimal impact. That is why we are urging again that we need government support not only from the MOHFW but also from all other relevant ministries. If we consider maternal health, we do not need to implement the integration issue in all the maternal health clinics in the same way. What is required is that we have to select the area, the population group and who are at risk – then only we can specifically counsel them in a maternal health setting and find the risk of transmission from their body to the coming child. That is the main purpose. ABM Kamrul Hasan, Programme Coordinator, UNODC We have a policy document on HIV AIDS, which was officially endorsed perhaps 20 years back in 1997. The journey started in around 1994/95. At that time most of the Asian countries did not have any policy regarding HIV/AIDS. Later on, we prepared the strategic document -- National HIV AIDS Strategy. In terms of policy and strategy, it was fantastic. The country was in a very good position. After 20 years, we have to re-think whether we should go back again to the policy, whether we should update, whether we should revise the policy or not. That is very important because the situation has changed in a multifarious way. We should be at per with the change. At that time our focus was just to combat HIV. We did not realise its relation with other health issues. If you go through the policy, it will say everywhere that, the other reproductive health issue was not considered very much. For example,we only focused upon the injecting drug users, but not about other injecting forms and other drugs. We did not address how the young generation was induced with the illicit drugs and what is the relation between reproductive health and HIV. That time these issues were not discussed nor addressed. After 20 years it is very important to look back again to that policy. When we talk about integration we have to consider the issue of human resource for health. Who are the main implementers of our health programmes? Each and every union has a union FWC (Family Welfare Center). In most unions we have the union sub centre. In Upazila, we have Upazila Health Centre. They are the main providers of reproductive health services. We have to integrate our HIV /AIDS programme with these mainstream providers of health and family planning services. We have also facilitated community health service. If we go back to the policy and strategy, we must consider broader perspective rather than only focusing on HIV or STI. For example, child-marriage, adolescent-pregnancy, illicit drugs taken by young generation are really pertinent issues related to reproductive health, which make individuals vulnerable to HIV/STI. HIV or STI infection is the outcome of many issues. All we need to do is to address all the pertinent issues so that we can cut the HIV infection or STI occurrences. It is our goal. We should provide more adolescent friendly health services because they often think that they dont require any healthcare. Our SRH and family planning programmes are very much focused on married couple. There is a large section of unmarried man and women who also need SRH and family planning services. We have to incorporate some life skill programmes in our SRH and HIV policies. It is important for the young and adolescents. Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque MDG and ICPD policy documents are very relevant to this linkage issue. I want to quote from the ICPD document: ""information, education and counseling for responsible sexual behaviour and effective transmission of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV should become integral component to all SRH services"". We are a signatory to the ICPD Programme of Action. So we are obliged to formulate and implement programmes in an integrated way. Dr. Ishrat Jahan, Programme Manager, Adolescent and Reproductive Health, DGFP DGFP can do a lot in terms of providing integrated services. We have large number of field level workers. We can employ them in integrated services. In our country women only come to hospital when it is an urgent issue. From the gender perspective it can be said that sometimes they are not allowed to come. When they come to our service centres we screen them and make them aware about HIV issues. I have doubts about the quality of knowledge of our service providers on HIV. So training for the field workers on HIV is urgently needed. DGFP provide some SRH services to adolescents. In different districts we conduct awareness campaign on this issue. We are also talking about preventing child marriage and adolescent pregnancy. We need to add some information about HIV and high risk behaviour with SRH. Now we are reviewing our adolescent reproductive health strategy. We have already finalized reproductive health action plan. We will disseminate the action plan soon. In the new action plan we have committed to do more about adolescent reproductive health. In our reproductive health programs we should include the HIV issue. In our family planning centres we should have some diagnosis facility for women who are at risk, for example women who have husbands living abroad or addicted or open to high risk behaviour. It is important because there is a risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child. My next point is safe blood transfusion. In delivery section,when any emergency situation arises we need lot of blood.Thats why it is very important to screen blood properly in delivery centres. Otherwise it can cause HIV infection to both mother and child. We have to promote only condom. We have to inform people about the dual use of condom: family planning and prevent HIV and STD. We should focus more on men. If they are aware then it becomes easy for his spouse to maintain a safe sexual and reproductive health. So men should be incorporated in our campaign. Dr. Abdul Waheed, Line Director, NASP How human resource for health and HIV prevention should be linked is an important question. In our national strategy it is clearly explained. But we are not implementing it. So we have to think how to implement it. We are doing different things in different ways. For example, DGFP and DGHS are doing things according to their own plans. But there should be a linkage at some point. That point should be at the service level. Leo Kenny, Country Director, UNAIDS It is widely recognized that we can get better results by avoiding parallel health system. It needs to be done not only in terms of SRH and HIV but also in range of services such as TB, MCH etc. In this age countries can not afford not to do it because it means efficient use of resources is not being made. By 2015, we should achieve the desired progress in linkage issue. Improvement of linkage between HIV and sexual reproductive health is very important. If a country does not make enough progress it is because of the following reasons: your analysis of the service delivery is flawed; you are not doing enough to ensure linkage between the service systems to promote maternal health and health of children; weak health systems and lack of an entry point to address sexual and gender based violence; you are not doing enough to ensure linkage among MDG 3,4,5 and 6. We are not harnessing the opportunity of using the HIV entry point to address the MCH issues, we need to harmonize the funding of HIV and SRH; we are not strengthening capacity of our service providers to link between SRH and HIV. There are also some legal barriers to this integration effort. That happens to key population like transgender, sex workers, people injecting drugs, men having sex with men and adolescent population who do not have access to health services. We must do more to address stigma and discrimination, including removal of punitive laws and policies that block access to services of those people who are most at risk. Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque I want to quote some lines from the 2010 ANGUS Report: ""Response to HIV in Bangladesh is provided through multiple funders and multiple implementers. Lack of smooth coordination among player is a major hindrance to providing quality services. In Bangladesh multiple ministries need to be involved to ensure key services. This is not carried out effectively. Roles and responsibilities of designated focul points in 16 ministries need to be clarified and reactivated."" This is very important. We have 16 HIV focal points in 16 ministries. If we can activate the integration process will be smoother. M A Siddiqui, Columnist Education is an important means to disseminate HIV information. Our education curriculum should include comprehensive reproductive health education. We can talk about SRH in forums but not in our families. We should come out of such stigma. Dr. Halidah Khandaker I want to tell our parents to take courage and talk to your children about SRH and HIV issues. When we first went for campaign in schools, the headmaster asked us only to take science students. I had to fight with them to make them understand that the student from Arts background would also be a man or women. So take courage and be careful. Saleh Ahmed , ED, Bondhu Social Welfare Society Among the transgender community we only provide condom and STI services. But we are not able provide them other SRH services. So they remain vulnerable. There is also an important issue of access for the transgender community. Providing SRH services can not be separated from the livelihood issue. Our transgender community has very little access to formal job market. Thats why they have to opt for risky professions for earning livelihood. It makes them more vulnerable to HIV/ AIDS. When we talk about gender-based violence we do not count the transgender. They are also victims of different kind of violence. There should be strong punitive measures in case of violence against transgender and feminine male. There is a large group of man having sex with man. Most of them start practicing this risky behaviour at the adolescent age. According to our government policy they are considered children and we cannot promote condom among children. But adolescents come to our centres and we are providing them condoms but we cannot register their name. So in policy formulation we have to also consider these issues. Dr. Tajuddin Oyeware, Chief, HIV/ AIDS , Unicef Every child has a right to survive. Meaning that when it is born, it has the right to born free of HIV. Within that framework we look at the issue of HIV. We have to explore opportunities that bring about efficiency of investment and effectiveness of intervention. And to do that integration and linkage is central. If we go about doing parallel programme we will not achieve anything. It will be expensive. There will be lot of duplication and wastages. We do not have any other options than to push hard for integration and linkages. For that we need to do something at policy level. UNICEF unequivocally supports linkages between SRH and HIV. I want to focus on two important groups: adolescents and pregnant mothers. They are the continuum of cares. At the pre-pregnant period, what does the girl need? She needs good reproductive health and to be free of HIV. She needs HIV counseling and testing. And how do you implement HIV counseling and testing if you do not integrate SRH and HIV counseling? When one visits a SRH expert he or she can ask for HIV testing. Even to prevent the transmission of HIV from the mother to the child, contraceptive is critical .When a mother decides not to be a pregnant, a child cannot be infected. The important topic about which we do not talk much is that when a mother is HIV positive she needs access to family planning method to delay pregnancy or not to be pregnant at all. When a mother is pregnant, the matter of integration comes again. MCH service providers can easily provide HIV testing and counseling services. It is the best place to do that. Bangladesh has made massive progress in cutting down the rate of under-five mortality. We have to integrate early infection diagnosis for the infants at the point of neonatal care. Bangladesh has all the ingredients to do a successful integration but we need to join them together. 2014 is the best time to do that because at that time we will do the midterm review of National HIV/AIDS strategy . At that time, midterm review of the National Health Population Sector Wide Programme will also be held. So we have a great opportunity to link all these together. Ali Reza, OIC, UNIC Awareness requires dissemination of proper information. It leads to understanding. Understanding leads to awareness. Awareness leads to actions. And positive actions lead to change. And this change makes the desired goal of a nation. Since the young generation is the agent of change we have to talk about our youths when we talk about any integration. We have to know the need of reproductive health services of the young population. We mostly focus upon vulnerable groups. But there are large number of young groups who are out of the counting but equally vulnerable to HIV infection. We want other daily newspapers to come forward like The Daily Star in holding discussion on HIV issues and make our citizens aware. Among the TV channel only the state run BTV shows HIV related programmes. There are many channels in our country that do everything except showing any programme on HIV. We urge them to allow some slots for dissemination of HIV information. Mainstream radio channels as well as community radio channels should also join the campaign. In many cases, educated people, even doctors, are not aware about AIDS infection. I know someone whose wife got infected during delivery of her child. One of her relatives donated her blood during emergency delivery operation. The blood screening system was poor. So she got infected. In many renowned hospitals in the country blood screening is not properly done. We should also emphasise on this issue. I would urge to observe International AIDS Day in all educational institutions. Our schools should teach students about SRH and HIV. The students will further disseminate the message.. Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque UNFPA have recently started a radio ad on HIV in Dhaka FM. It is a 30 seconds slot and will be aired 60 times in 24 hours for 40 days. Dr. Samir Kumar Howlader, National Programme Officer, IOM Linkage at the service level is not possible without linkage at the strategic and policy level. Mostly we do some sporadic work of integration at the field level that in the long run fails to sustain due to lack of proper policies of integration at the national level. Integration will bear good results if we consider the vulnerability of the migrant workers. They are termed emerging vulnerable population in the third national strategic plan. We did some sporadic work for migrant workers to prevent HIV infection like pre-departure orientation and linkages to service providers after they are back. But we do not have any policy for their spouses. This is an important area of integration. If we integrate SRH with HIV, then the spouses who stay back in the home country can access the SRH services as well as HIV consultation. Why do we not include unmarried young people? We only work for married couple. We should focus on unmarried young people. When we talk about multi-ministerial involvement we know that there are 16 ministries that are involved in the committee on HIV and HIV focal points are there. I do not know if Ministry of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas Development is involved there. If they are not involved then nothing can be done successfully for the migrants. Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque It is really a challenge to follow up HIV issues of an immigrant from country of origin to country of destination. We have to address the challenge seriously. Dr. Muhammad Munir Hussain, Project Manager, Plan International Bangladesh We are overburdened with policies and strategies. I want to emphasise on mainstreaming, both internally and externally. Different ministries have different policies. We have to know if there is something about HIV. Then we have to coordinate those policies with the national HIV policy. We have incorporated HIV issues in our secondary school curriculum. In 2012, we have also incorporated different SRH issues in the curriculum of secondary school. Now, it is not just about small family. In the curriculum, we have discussed adolescent reproductive health and family planning issues, in details. But we need to train our school teachers so that they can teach these things in a student-friendly way. Shashish Shami Kamal, Youth Member, UNFPA Youth Group To reach the critical youth population we have to involve the youths themselves in our campaign. Then it will be easier to reach young people and create a lasting impact upon them. When I was a member of an anti-smoking group, we undertook an anti-smoking campaign and involved some of the smokers. It worked like a miracle. They motivated others not to smoke and some of them broke the bad habit. We need more research on men and masculinity. Masculinity is socially constructed. Masculinity breeds some negative ideals that attract young boys. Young people are curious about everything under the sun and get involved in various harmful practices just out of curiosity and manipulated by different patriarchal constructions of manhood. It may be injecting drugs, having multiple partners and so on, which make them vulnerable to HIV and STDs. So we have to work on the idea of masculinity and fight out wrong notions of manhood. We need to understand the young man, his ideas and his curiosity and reach them with information about HIV and SRH in ingenuous ways. The masculinity issue should also be included in the HIV research paradigm. Another important issue is using ICT in dissemination of information about HIV. We can also make communication channels so that one can get HIV and SRH service related information over phone or via internet without disclosing his or her identity. Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque We need to work more on leadership issue to raise the voices of young people. We want to see youth-friendly programs and services . DGFP has already introduced some adolescent friendly services. Cdre (Rtd.) Nurul Amin Chowdhury, Programme Advisor, RTM International Our strategy should be sensitive to our social reality. In village areas, it is still difficult to talk about HIV. We have to reach them in innovative ways and help get rid of the social stigma about HIV. We have to provide HIV related information and SRH services in an integration package so that people can also understand linkage between HIV and SRH and do not shy away from the services. Dr. Ishrat Jahan We are not providing contraceptive to unmarried adolescents. But there are large numbers of unmarried adolescents who are involved in sexual activities. They are high-risk group. We do not even register their names; even there is no column in the register book for unmarried adolescents. This is an important area to work on. To provide them contraceptives we have to change our policy. Our policies are solely focused on married couples. We should change our perception and incorporate unmarried adolescents in our services. Dr. K.K Ezazul Haque UNFPA has strong mandate to work on integration of HIV and SRH issues. We are trying our best to do so. We are providing training to service providers to build their capacity on delivering integrated services. We are also providing technical assistance to NASP. UNFPA has closely worked with the government to formulate a communication strategy for integrated services. We have learnt a lot from todays roundtable. We will incorporate your recommendations and work together for creating an effective linkage between HIV and SRH. UNFPA and The Daily Star jointly organized a roundtable on Prevention of HIV in Bangladesh recently. Below we publish a summary of the discussions -- Editor",{},"['integration', 'policy', 'reproductive', 'health', 'srh', 'programme', 'hiv', 'services', 'issue', 'need', 'prevention', 'bangladesh']","First, if we can integrate SRH and HIV, it will ensure the financial sustainability of the programme in relation to SRH and HIV. If we consider maternal health and do integration of maternal health and HIV, there would be less risk of HIV transmission from mother to child. HIV programme and family planning programme are doing the same condom promotion programme but in an incoherent manner. One clinic is doing the STI (sexually transmitted infections) services and they are also providing the HIV services. If we integrate SRH with HIV, then the spouses who stay back in the home country can access the SRH services as well as HIV consultation.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news/prevention-of-hiv-in-bangladesh
Novel HIV vaccine candidate found safe and responsive,New research published in The Lancet shows that an experimental HIV-1 vaccine regimen is well-tolerated and generated comparable and robust immune responses against HIV in healthy adults and rhesus monkeys.,,2018-07-08,The Daily Star,"New research published in The Lancet shows that an experimental HIV-1 vaccine regimen is well-tolerated and generated comparable and robust immune responses against HIV in healthy adults and rhesus monkeys. Moreover, the vaccine candidate protected against infection with an HIV-like virus in monkeys. Based on the results from this phase 1/2a clinical trial that involved nearly 400 healthy adults, a phase 2b trial has been initiated in southern Africa to determine the safety and efficacy of the HIV-1 vaccine candidate in 2,600 women at risk for acquiring HIV. This is one of only five experimental HIV-1 vaccine concepts that have progressed to efficacy trials in humans in the 35 years of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Previous HIV-1 vaccine candidates have typically been limited to specific regions of the world. The experimental regimens tested in this study are based on ‘mosaic’ vaccines that take pieces of different HIV viruses and combine them to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of HIV strains. “These results represent an important milestone. This study demonstrates that the mosaic Ad26 prime, Ad26 plus gp140 boost HIV vaccine candidate induced robust immune responses in humans and monkeys with comparable magnitude, kinetics, phenotype, and durability and also provided 67% protection against viral challenge in monkeys”, says Professor Dan Barouch, Director of the Centre for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA who led the study. Almost 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. A safe and effective preventative vaccine is urgently needed to curb the HIV pandemic. A key hurdle to HIV vaccine development has been the lack of direct comparability between clinical trials and preclinical studies. To address these methodological issues, Barouch and colleagues evaluated the leading mosaic adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates in parallel clinical and pre-clinical studies to identify the optimal HIV vaccine regimen to advance into clinical efficacy trials. The APPROACH trial recruited 393 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults (aged 18-50 years) from 12 clinics in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the USA between February 2015 and October 2015. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either one of seven vaccine combinations or a placebo, and were given four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks. Results showed that all vaccine regimens tested were capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in healthy individuals and were well tolerated, with similar numbers of local and systemic reactions reported in all groups, most of which were mild-to-moderate in severity. Five participants reported at least one vaccine-related grade 3 adverse event such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea, postural dizziness, and back pain. No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were reported. In a parallel study, the researchers assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the same Ad26-based mosaic vaccine regimens in 72 rhesus monkeys using a series repeated challenges with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) — a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys. The Ad26/Ad26 plus gp140 vaccine candidate induced the greatest immune responses in humans and also provided the best protection in monkeys — resulting in complete protection against SHIV infection in two-thirds of the vaccinated animals after six challenges. The authors note several limitations, including the fact that the relevance of vaccine protection in rhesus monkeys to clinical efficacy in humans remains unclear. They also note that there is no definitive immunological measurement that is known to predict protection against HIV-1 in humans.",{},"['hiv1', 'responses', 'novel', 'responsive', 'candidate', 'immune', 'safe', 'humans', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'clinical', 'monkeys', 'protection']","New research published in The Lancet shows that an experimental HIV-1 vaccine regimen is well-tolerated and generated comparable and robust immune responses against HIV in healthy adults and rhesus monkeys.

HIV/AIDS: Bangladesh at high risk?,,,2007-12-01,The Daily Star,"Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country with several well-documented at-risk groups, the most prominent of which is brothel-based sex workers and injecting drug users. Although prevalence rate is remaining low in the country, it is surrounded by nations with much higher prevalence rates and with its own at-risk population. Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/Aids infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in Colombo, on August 19-23, 2007. The outbreak of HIV in neighbouring countries, cross borders and steady rise of STIs make Bangladesh a high-risk zone for HIV/AIDS prevalence. Todays low level of HIV infection in our country does not guarantee low prevalence tomorrow. Experience teaches us that early epidemics do not show their magnitude at the beginning. This is good news that our government, donors, and large numbers of NGOs have begun serious investment in both research and prevention interventions. But it also requires efforts of care and support for the people living with HIV/AIDS. It is difficult to capture such a large range of activities with one or just a few indicators. However, a set of well-established health care indicators may help to identify general strengths and weaknesses of health systems. The scale of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has exceeded all expectations since its identification in 1981. As the spread of HIV has been greater than predicted, its severe impact on social, capital, population structure and economic growth has been apprehended. High risk factors Behavioral risk factors for HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh are in a danger situation. Besides that there are potential bio-medical risk factors including: (i) an unregulated blood supply system in which blood used in transfusions is not screened for HIV and is donated primarily by professional donors; (ii) unsterile injections in non-formal and formal health-care settings; and (iii) a high prevalence in high-risk groups of other sexually transmitted diseases, which may function as co-factors for HIV transmission, particularly if chronically untreated. Bangladesh behavioral surveillance survey (BSS) reports on several high-risk factors: (a) large number of men buying sex than in other countries in Asia, (b) low levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, (c) low perception of personal risk among vulnerable populations, and (d) low condom use rates among sex workers. Knowledge and behaviour Information on knowledge and on the level and intensity of risk behaviours related to HIV/AIDS is essential in identifying populations at most risk for HIV infection and in better understanding the dynamics of the epidemic.The indicators on knowledge and misconceptions are an important prerequisite for prevention programmes to focus on increasing peoples knowledge about sexual transmission, and, to overcome the misconceptions that act as a disincentive to behaviour change. Indicators on sexual behaviour and the promotion of safer sexual behavior are at the core of HIV/AIDS programmes, particularly with young people who are embarking on their sexual lives, and who are more amenable to behavioral change than adults. Overall denial and apparent confusion about their own risk of acquiring an HIV infection increased among brothel sex workers, with a rise in the “dont know” response from about 25% to 40%. It is not likely that knowledge percentage was scant, it is far more likely that increased insecurity regarding the future maintenance of their residences and livelihoods diminished their capacity to insist on condom use. STD/STI situation The predominant mode of transmission of both HIV and other STD/STIs is sexual intercourse. Measures for preventing sexual transmission of HIV and STIs are the same, as are the target audiences for interventions. In addition, strong evidence supports several biological mechanisms through which STIs facilitate HIV transmission by increasing both HIV infectiousness and HIV susceptibility in Bangladesh. In the 2004-05, the Sentinel Surveillance mentioned that syphilis rates were high among hijras (20%) and varied from 6 percent to 16 percent among brothel based female sex workers. A declining trend of syphilis was however observed at many of the city brothels. Epidemiological situation The first case of HIV infection was detected in Bangladesh in 1989; by the end of December 2006 the official number of reported cases of HIV was 874 with 240 cases of AIDS of which 109 had died. Bangladesh as a nation has a low prevalence of HIV but risk behaviours are sufficient enough for continued HIV transmission among groups at higher risk and to its general population. Bangladesh has an established second generation HIV surveillance system. This system consists of a sero-surveillance component (implemented by ICDDR,B for the Government of Bangladesh, using World Bank/DFID funding) and a behavioral surveillance component (executed by Family Health International, funded by USAID). The data indicate that HIV prevalence rates among the most vulnerable population groups and some bridging population groups (mainly male clients of sex workers) have remained at Criminalisation of HIV transmission Several countries have recently introduced laws to criminalise HIV transmission, or exposing another person to the virus. A number of jurisdictions have used general laws against serious bodily harm in cases where someone is accused of knowingly transmitting HIV or willingly exposing others to HIV transmission. Subject of controversy, these measures are sparking debate and concern among policymakers, legal and public health professionals, international organisations and civil society, on whether criminal law is applicable in such cases and if such application is accomplishing or damaging public health goals such as universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. Addressing these issues, UNAIDS brought together a range of stakeholders in Geneva for a three-day international consultation (31 Oct - 2 Nov 2007) to discuss the apparent trend of criminalisation of HIV transmission in the context of national responses. Conclusion Responding to HIV/AIDS on a scale commensurate with the epidemic is a global imperative, and the tools for an effective response are inevitable. Detection and treatment of individuals with STIs is an important part of an HIV control strategy. Clinical services offering STI care are an important access point for people at high risk for both STIs and HIV. Identifying people with STIs allows for not only the benefit of treating the STI, but for prevention education, HIV testing, identifying HIV-infected persons in need of care, and partner notification for STIs or HIV infection. Nothing less than a sustained social mobilisation is necessary to combat one of the most serious crises facing the world community today. As the chair of the Technical Committee of the National AIDS Committee said, a poor country Bangladesh has to opt for preventive measures rather than depend on costly drugs or future vaccines.

HIV prevalence remains low in Bangladesh: Unicef,"The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among general population remains low in Bangladesh, Unicef said in a new report released yesterday on its website.",,2018-11-30,The Daily Star,"The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among general population remains low in Bangladesh, Unicef said in a new report released yesterday on its website. “In 2017 Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reported that among the 865 new reported cases, more than 5% were children and adolescents less than 18 years and 25% were women,” said the report. It said Unicef Bangladesh and National HIV Programme of the government are working for sustainability and scaling up of the services on prevention of mother to child transmission and HIV prevention. About the global scenarios, the report said some 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030. “This means 76 adolescent deaths every day – without additional investment in HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes,” it said. The report -- Children, HIV and AIDS: The world in 2030 -- notes that based on population projections, and at current trends, the number of 0-19 year-olds newly infected with HIV will reach an estimated 270,000 in 2030, decreasing by one third over current estimates. It shows that the number of children and adolescents dying from AIDS-related causes will decline, from a current 119,000 to 56,000 in 2030. However, this downward trajectory is too slow, particularly among adolescents. According to the report, by 2030, the number of new HIV infections among children in the first decade of life will be cut in half while new infections among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years old will only decrease by 29 percent. AIDS-related deaths are projected to decrease by 57 percent among children below the age of 14, compared to a 35 percent decrease among those aged 15 to 19 years. “The report makes it clear, without the shadow of a doubt, that the world is off track when it comes to ending AIDS among children and adolescents by 2030,” said Henrietta Fore, Unicef executive director. “Programmes to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to babies are paying off but havent gone far enough, while programmes to treat the virus and prevent it from spreading among older children are nowhere near where they should be,” she said. Unicef estimates that nearly 700 adolescents aged between 10 and 19 are newly infected with HIV every day -- or one every two minutes.

About the global scenarios, the report said some 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030. “This means 76 adolescent deaths every day – without additional investment in HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes,” it said.

Second HIV remission patient ignites cure hope,For just the second time ever a HIV patient is in sustained remission from the virus in what was hailed by experts yesterday as proof that the AIDS-causing condition could one day be curable.,,2019-03-06,The Daily Star,"For just the second time ever a HIV patient is in sustained remission from the virus in what was hailed by experts yesterday as proof that the AIDS-causing condition could one day be curable. Ten years almost to the day since the first confirmed case of an HIV-infected person being rid of the deadly disease, a man known only as the ""London patient"" has shown no sign of the virus for nearly 19 months, doctors reported in the journal Nature. Both patients underwent bone marrow transplants to treat blood cancers, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold. ""It is a landmark. After 10 years of not being able to replicate (the first case), people were wondering if this was a fluke,"" said lead author Ravindra Gupta, a professor at the University of Cambridge. ""I think it is important to reaffirm that this is real and it can be done,"" Gupta told AFP. Millions of people infected with HIV around the globe keep the disease in check with so-called antiretroviral therapy (ARV), but the treatment does not rid patients of the virus. Close to 37 million people are living with HIV worldwide, but only 59 percent are receiving ARV. Nearly one million people die every year from HIV-related causes. A new drug-resistant form of HIV is also a growing concern. The first sustained remission survivor, announced in 2009 as ""the Berlin patient"" and later named as American Timothy Brown, was given two transplants and underwent total body irradiation to treat leukaemia -- a process that nearly killed him. Gupta said that while a second successful transplant did not constitute a generalised cure, his teams work showed that even milder forms of treatment can achieve full HIV remission.

Responsible behavior and HIV/AIDS,,,2013-12-14,The Daily Star,"HIV/AIDS was first detected among a few homosexual men. Gradually the proportion of women infected by HIV has risen. Of the total infected persons globally, 48% are women. Among them majority are young and adolescent, many are married and have had one partner i.e. their legal husband. Married women who are faithful to their husbands and had no history of pre-marital or extra-marital relationship are not less vulnerable to HIV infection. In the recent report published by UNFPA (State of world population 2005) it was stated that sex within the bondage of marriage is not always safe and cannot give protection against HIV infection. The percentage of women becoming infected by their legal partner is increasing alarmingly. In India 90% of HIV infected women were virgin when they were married, had no history of pre-marital sex and remained faithful to their husbands (State of world population 2005). The scenario in Bangladesh is almost the same as that of India. Unfortunately there is no authentic data on how many married women got HIV infection from their husband. In the voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) center of CAAP, 6702 samples of blood had been tested for HIV since 1996 to date and 451 persons were found HIV positive. Out of them 159 were women. Except a few of these unfortunate women all of them got the infection from the legal bondage of marriage, i.e. from their husband. It has been observed that community leaders, religious leaders, even civil society and elites have believe that one cannot get HIV infection within the legal relationship of marriage. This strong belief/misconception is dangerous. HIV has no respect for legal relationship within the bondage of marriage or illegal relation without marriage. HIV can infect anyone, married or unmarried, if someone has sexual contact (irresponsible behavior) with any HIV infected person without the protection of condom. Use of condom, or protected sex, is the responsibility of men. Married women all over the world cannot negotiate safe sex with their husband even though they are aware of their husband’s extra marital relations. Because of their subordinated status, women cannot even challenge the fidelity of their husband. Yet they are the victims. Men’s responsible behavior can save the situation.

HIV infects one teenage girl every 3 minutes: UN,"Every three minutes, a girl between the ages of 15 and 19 is infected with the virus that causes AIDS, says a UN report that warns of a ""crisis"" fuelled by gender inequality.",,2018-07-26,The Daily Star,"Every three minutes, a girl between the ages of 15 and 19 is infected with the virus that causes AIDS, said a UN report Wednesday that warned of a ""crisis"" fuelled by gender inequality. Every three minutes, a girl between the ages of 15 and 19 is infected with the virus that causes AIDS, said a UN report Wednesday that warned of a ""crisis"" fuelled by gender inequality. Girls and young women made up two-thirds of 15- to 19-year-olds infected with HIV in 2017, according to data unveiled at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Henrietta Fore, head of the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF), referred to it as a ""crisis of health"". ""In most countries, women and girls lack access to information, to services, or even just the power to say no to unsafe sex,"" she said. ""HIV thrives among the most vulnerable and marginalised, leaving teenage girls at the centre of the crisis."" Last year, 130,000 youngsters aged 19 and under died from AIDS, while 430,000 -- almost 50 every hour -- were newly infected, the agency said. While AIDS-related deaths have decreased since 2010 in all other age groups, among older adolescents aged 15 to 19 they have remained stubbornly constant. About 1.2 million 15- to 19-year-olds were living with the immune system-destroying virus in 2017, three in five of them girls, said UNICEF. ""The epidemics spread among adolescent girls is being fuelled by early sex, including with older males, forced sex, powerlessness in negotiating about sex, poverty, and lack of access to confidential counselling and testing services,"" it pointed out. Actress and activist Charlize Theron raised the issue in an address to conference delegates on Tuesday. Youth bulge The AIDS epidemic is ""not just about sex or sexuality,"" the South African celebrity said. ""We know it is linked to the second-class status of women and girls worldwide."" Robert Matiru, director of operations for Unitaid, which funds HIV drug projects, said young people are disproportionately affected by the epidemic that has claimed some 35 million lives since it erupted in the 1980s. ""They are the most affected now, across sub-Saharan Africa in particular,"" he told AFP. ""Unless we can reach young people and curb the epidemic among them... then were not going to meet the targets"" of the UN to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. This requires limiting infections to 500,000 per year by 2020, yet last year they numbered 1.8 million. A recent report of the International AIDS Society (IAS) highlighted the epidemics ""extraordinary impact"" on adolescent girls and young women. ""Four in 10 adolescent girls (aged 15-19) in Africa have experienced physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner, and the evidence is that gender-based violence is associated with a significantly greater risk of acquiring HIV,"" it said. ""Yet few countries have invested in comprehensive programmes to combat gender-based violence or to ensure ready access to adolescent-friendly sexual and reproductive health services."" According to IAS president Linda-Gail Bekker, ""in young people, it (the AIDS epidemic) is far from over."" ""In certain parts of the world we are about to go into the youth bulge, so well have more young people than weve ever had in the world before,"" she told AFP.

Climate change may increase deaths from HIV/AIDS,,,2010-05-08,The Daily Star,"Climate change is the latest threat to the worlds growing HIV/AIDS epidemic, according to a group of Australian experts. A leading professor of health and human rights, Daniel Tarantola of the University of New South Wales, has warned that global warming will indirectly make people of developing countries even more vulnerable to death and severe ill-health from HIV/AIDS. Prominent Australian HIV scientist, Professor David Cooper, Director of the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research opined that climate change will lead to food scarcity and poorer nutrition, putting people with perilous immune systems at more risk of dying of HIV, as well as contracting and transmitting new and unusual infections. Experts identified certain factors that are interrelated to climate change can help kill more people with HIV/AIDS. Poverty, illiteracy, proximity, malnutrition, unemployment, slum housing, very mobile populations are closely related to climate change and may contribute to large number of deaths from AIDS. The increasing mortality from these infectious diseases has had several negative consequences: decreasing economic productivity, increasing medical costs, and taxing already tenuous health care systems in poor countries. The rising frequency of extreme climatic events such as floods and droughts, render developing countries with increasingly less time to recover. Although Bangladesh is a low prevalence country for HIV/AIDS, there are certain major risks that may lead to an epidemic if they are not controlled effectively. There are about 1,500 cases of HIV/Aids have been confirmed and reported — it was 1,207 in 2007 and 1,495 in 2008.The number of undetected cases is much higher. Bangladesh has an estimated 20,000-40,000 people who inject drugs Sharing injecting equipment increases the HIV risk (11.5 percent HIV positive cases were diagnosed recently in more than one IDU cluster in Dhaka,). In addition, increased number of migrant workers is also a major concern. More than 80 percent of the diagnosed HIV positive are migrant Bangladeshi workers and their wives. Now, the impacts of climate change can be a risk for increased number of deaths from HIV/AIDS here in Bangladesh. So, policies and strategies for HIV/AIDS need to be implemented, monitored and evaluated at different levels, involving both public and private actors. This will guide the researchers and practitioners who are involved with HIV/AIDS to respond efficiently and in time to control the spread of this deadly disease.

Chittagong Medical College (CMC) arranged the seminar titled  Universal Access and Human Rights  with the slogan  stop Aids, keep the promise  at its Salam Auditorium Hall to mark World AIDS Day yesterday. The speakers pointed out that information gap, ignorance, and blurred concepts on the disease among mass people have caused the number of infections to rise in the country nowadays. They called upon all people for creating mass awareness about the disease. Dr Pravat Barua, president of World Aids Day-2010 observance committee, chaired the programme also presenting the keynote paper on  universal access and human rights . Prof Barua in the paper said Aids is communicable, but not a contagious disease. Globally, particularly in Asia and India, HIV cases are reducing while the infections are on the rise in Bangladesh. He said 82 percent people in our country know what Aids is. Officially, some 1,745 cases have been reported so far. However, 40-70 lakh people addicted with drugs are at risk of infection, he added.

HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh,,,2010-11-27,The Daily Star,"Target of universal access to treatment Is yet to achieve Dr Md Rajib Hossain Although the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh is not high, the country has failed to ensure antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of this small figure. According to a recent progress report by World Health Organisation (WHO), Bangladesh has not moved even closer to achieve the universal access target of ART. Experts identified limited services given only by NGOs, social marginalisation, lack of human resources, diagnostics and other health systems bottlenecks as the key factors behind this. In order to lessen the prevalence of HIV/AIDS, United Nations member states in 2006 committed to the goal of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010. Although there is a 13-fold increase in ART coverage worldwide over six years, only one third of people in need have access to treatment. The coverage of prevention interventions is still insufficient and most people living with HIV remain unaware of their HIV status. Population surveys in ten countries showed more than 60 percent of HIV-positive people did not know their HIV status. As a result, many patients start treatment too late. Around 18 percent of patients initiating treatment were lost to follow-up during the first year, a large proportion of them dying due to late initiation of treatment. According to the progress report, only eight low- and middle-income countries have achieved universal access target or coverage of 80 percent or higher for ART based on data from end of 2009. Also, there are 21 countries that are moving closer to achieve the universal access target, with coverage rates between 50-80 percent for ART. In Bangladesh, Ashar Alo Society, Mukto Akash Bangladesh and Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention (CAP) are the three NGOs working to provide coverage of ART to all people living with HIV/AIDS. Experts opined that along with NGOs, the government should establish more centres and monitor the programme strictly in order to ensure universal coverage. There is urgent need to provide coverage of ART for people who are the most affected by HIV, especially injecting drug users (IDUs) where HIV/AIDS is a concentrated epidemic (more than 5%). Many high risk low- and middle-income countries have been shown promising ART coverage for most of its affected people. We need to work together to expand the services to make sure that not a single affected individual are left out of treatment services. E-mail: rajib.hossain@thedailystar.net Incorporating reproductive health services for young people through the national HIV/AIDS responses Dr Nizam Uddin Ahmed One of the characteristics of HIV/AIDS pandemic globally is — it affects young people the most and turns into a generalised epidemic through this segment. As such most of the prevention related regimen are concerned with reducing the vulnerabilities of youth to HIV/AIDS exposure by creating enabling environment for them through availability and accessibility of appropriate services and related information. There is common assumption that young people do not need reproductive and sexual health related information and service prior to marriage. This exacerbates their susceptibility in fact. Hence at the inception stage of the national programme under the GFATM grants, the human rights perspective for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support regimen for addressing the neglected areas of reproductive health information and services for youth was established. Essentially this translated into generating simultaneous thrusts towards diminishing the primary barriers of beliefs, norms, stigma and discrimination. At the initial phase the intervention components focused on mass media campaign, youth friendly health services, life skills education, access to condoms, institutionalising HIV/AIDS information in mainstream education curriculum, advocacy with societal decision makers and religious leaders and developing evidence base for policy and programme The incorporation between HIV/AIDS and reproductive health has paved the path for establishing youth friendly health services and life skills education that prepares young people to adjust with the emotional and physical changes they experience, analyse critical situation to avoid exposure and the ability eschew peer pressure on premarital sex, substance abuse and early marriage. So, integration of HIV/AIDS within the existing paradigm of reproductive health and education services is need of the time.

They said the drug users and sex workers are the most risky groups to spread HIV, but the efforts to free youths from drug addiction and to supply adequate condoms to brothels are not adequate. They emphasised that the authorities should frame a pragmatic policy on HIV/AIDs, while the government, NGOs and donors must join hands to formulate an action plan to create massive awareness, provide care and support to infected people and reduce the increasing rate of infection by 2015.

Understanding HIV and AIDS,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a form of virus that may cause an infection, but AIDS is a condition or a syndrome.",,2016-11-29,The Daily Star,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a form of virus that may cause an infection, but AIDS is a condition or a syndrome. Being infected with HIV can lead to the development of AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. AIDS develops when HIV has caused serious damage to the immune system. AIDS is the final stage of an HIV infection, when your body can no longer fight life-threatening infections like pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis. HOW IS HIV TRANSMITTED? HIV is most commonly found in two bodily fluids - blood and genital fluids like semen. It is transmitted through sexual contact (e.g. intercourse via any route), parenteral exposure to contaminated blood, transfusion of infected blood, pricks or cuts by needles/blades that are contaminated by infected blood, sharing of needles/syringes (mainly by substance abusers) and from mother to child (while the child is in the womb, during labour and through breastfeeding). HOW IS HIV NOT TRANSMITTED? There is no risk of transmitting HIV through kissing, spitting, being bitten, being sneezed on or through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. There is also no risk in sharing baths, towels, cutlery, or in using the same toilets or swimming pools. Contact with unbroken healthy skin and with animals/insects, too, does not result in the transmission of HIV. SYMPTOMS TO LOOK OUT FOR Symptoms can include fever, sore throat, body rash, tiredness, joint pain, muscle pain and swollen glands (lymph nodes). Once the immune system becomes severely damaged, symptoms can comprise weight loss, chronic diarrhoea, night sweats, skin problems, recurrent infections and serious life-threatening illnesses. DIAGNOSING HIV HIV can only be diagnosed through medical tests. If you think you might be at risk, you should immediately seek medical advice. The earlier HIV is diagnosed, the earlier you can start treatment, delay the severity of the illness and prevent the disease spreading to your near ones. The most common form of HIV test is a blood examination, in which a small amount of blood is taken and tested for HIV. This can provide a reliable result within four weeks of exposure to HIV. TREATING HIV Unfortunately, there are still no cures for AIDS. However, there are treatments that can prolong life of people tested HIV positive and can help them lead a productive life. PREVENTION OF HIV HIV is widely spread through unscreened blood transfusion so it is essential that all blood is meticulously checked before transfusion. A condom is the most effective form of protection against HIV and other STIs. It can be used for vaginal and anal sex, and for oral sex performed on men. HIV can be passed on before ejaculation, through pre-ejaculatory fluid and vaginal secretions, and from the anus. Safe sex should be practiced by people having risky sexual behaviours. Needles/syringes should not be shared among substance abusers. Other injecting equipments such as spoons and swabs should not be shared either as this exposes one to HIV and other viruses found in the blood, such as hepatitis C. Clean and sterile needles should be used while making tattoos. HIV AND PREGNANCY Treatment is available to prevent a pregnant woman from passing HIV to her unborn child. If left untreated, there is a one in four chance that the child will be infected with HIV. However, through proper medical care the risk can lowered to one in hundred. Due to advances in medicine, there is no increased risk of passing the virus to your baby with a normal delivery. However, for some women, a caesarean section may still be recommended. If you have HIV, do not breastfeed your baby because the virus can be transmitted through breast milk. If you or your partner have HIV, speak to a doctor as there are options for safely conceiving a child without putting either of you at risk of infection. World AIDS Day is observed on 1st December each year and is dedicated to raise worldwide awareness of the Acquired Immuno deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic caused by the spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. It is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in the fight against HIV, show their support for people living with HIV and to remember the people who have died.

Time to look back at the bridges we've crossed,"Every year World AIDS Day is observed on December 1, established by the World Health Organization in 1988 to bring people together in the fight against HIV and raise awareness of the epidemic that shook the world.",,2018-12-01,The Daily Star,"Every year World AIDS Day is observed on December 1, established by the World Health Organization in 1988 to bring people together in the fight against HIV and raise awareness of the epidemic that shook the world. This year, World AIDS Day will be marking its 30th anniversary and the theme is “Know Your Status”. This campaign aims to intensify HIV testing, which will enable people to make right and informed choices of treatment and prevention. World AIDS Day is an occasion to come together and renew our commitment to fight the disease, to analyse our success and what more needs to be done to achieve the goal to end the epidemic by 2030. On this day we wear red ribbons and revisit strategies in our fight against HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Undoubtedly massive achievement has been made in HIV and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) response since we first heard about the “mysterious virus” in the 1980s. According to the UNAIDS report (2018) “the number of AIDS-related deaths is the lowest this century, with fewer than 1 million people dying each year from AIDS-related illnesses”. The access to affordable antiretroviral treatment has contributed to this success. “Now a record 21.7 million people are on treatment—a net increase of 2.3 million people since the end of 2016” (UNAIDS data 2018). But the history of HIV and AIDS epidemic is one of fear, deaths, personal trauma and a long fight for affordable medicines. It required a handsome quintessential Hollywood actor Rock Hudson to die (1985) for the whole world to take notice of this epidemic. How can we forget that we lost flamboyant rockstar Freddie Mercury to this “mysterious virus”? The tragic death of high-profile personalities in rich countries brought attention to the epidemic that was killing millions of men, women and children from all walks of life around the world. Some of my colleagues were attending funerals of their friends almost every week in the 80s. They said that their friends were “dropping like flies”. Like many people of my generation born in Bangladesh, I was not aware of the growing grassroots movement in the 1980s and 1990s that was seeking to deal with an epidemic that appeared unmanageable and untreatable. It was much later, when I was studying public health that I became aware of the broader engagement of stakeholders in the HIV movement, and heard about some more great examples of HIV response, such as the global shaming effort that brought about the reduction in the cost of anti-retroviral drugs—an intervention that saved millions of lives. Current treatment costs for HIV can be as low as around USD 100 for a patient per year. This was not the case 25 years ago. The cost of treatment for HIV in 1994-95 was around USD 8,000-10,000 the (only available drug was azidothymidine AZT). The high cost of AZT was one of the major obstacles preventing access to treatment. It is said that AZT was the most expensive prescription drug up to that time. The unprecedented drop in price of medicines emerged from a confluence of grassroots movement, broader political engagement and, eventually, damage control by large pharmaceutical companies whose reputation was on the line—five pharmaceutical companies negotiating with UNAIDS for an unprecedented reduction in the price of anti-retroviral drugs in developing countries. Soon after, generic manufacturer such as Cipla in India began producing generic HIV medicines for developing countries that further brought down the drug price. The World Trade Organizations (WTO) Doha Declaration allowed developing countries to manufacture generic drugs, making treatment more affordable and accessible. In 2001 the United Nations General Assembly called for the creation of a “global fund” to intensify efforts by countries and organisations to fight the spread of HIV through prevention, treatment and care though affordable medication. Why am I telling this story today? On the occasion of World AIDS Day, I want to cherish the success of a movement that led pharmaceutical companies to allow production of generic drugs. We always hear that the pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to give up the rights of the patent. It was a long struggle to make drugs affordable since US Food and Drug Administration approved AZT as treatment for HIV in 1987, but it showed that voices raised strongly enough can change history. Now the HIV diagnosed patients do not look like Tom Hanks in the film Philadelphia (1993), the first major Hollywood movie to focus on AIDS. Being HIV positive is not a death sentence anymore. Available and affordable treatment has allowed people to live a normal, healthy life. I am very much aware that the success in combating HIV and AIDS has not reached every part of the world. Many countries still face challenges around access, resources, shortage of healthcare professionals, stigma and discrimination. But today I want to be with my colleagues who were part of the HIV movement. Sometimes we need to look back and see the bridges we crossed, the past that shaped the history of HIV movement, needs to be recognised. On the occasion of World AIDS Day, lets remember the success, let us not allow complacency to set in and take vows to eradicate the disease by 2030. We have a long way to go.

The government has taken various measures at different levels to create awareness among people and check spread of the disease, said Satkhira Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Delowar Haidar, the chief guest at the function. But the prime concern of the government is that Bangladesh is surrounded by countries like India, Nepal, Burma and Bhutan where the disease is spreading fast and that cross border visit by people are frequent for trade and other purposes, he said. Although there are a few HIV positive cases in the country, the number of such cases in neighbouring India, Thailand, Myanmar and Nepal is too high, he said. Besides sexual relations, some other factors like unchecked blood transfusion and use of conventional needle syringe to take drug or blood are responsible for HIV infection, speakers said at the meeting.

Cross-border Mobility And Hiv Vulnerability: Emphasis Experience,,,2014-05-20,The Daily Star,"CARE Bangladesh and The Daily Star have recently organised a roundtable on ""Cross-Border Mobility and HIV Vulnerability: EMPHASIS Experience"". We publish a summary of the discussion -- Editor Md. Abu Taher Md. Abu Taher, Team Leader-, Enhancing Mobile Populations Access to HIV and AIDS Services, Information and Support (EMPHASIS Project, CARE-Bangladesh) Emphasis is an operations research project on cross border mobility and HIV in South Asia. CARE was also the pioneer in working with sex workers, MSM/ Transgender, injecting drug users, internal migrants and people living with HIV (PLHIV) since 1995. Still we have been continuing IDU intervention since 1998. The first HIV-positive case diagnosed in Bangladesh, in 1989, was a returnee migrant. National surveillance data of 2011 revealed that HIV prevalence among sex workers in land port areas (Hili) is higher than average prevalence rate among sex workers in general. According to IOM data of 2012, 60% of the reported HIV-positives are migrants. We have to take this issue seriously because there are case studies in our neighbouring countries for example in Ganjam district in India where HIV-positive cases was in single digit in 1999-2000 but within ten years the number increased in thousands. According to 2001 India census, there were approximately 3 million Bangladeshi migrants working in India. Reasons of this huge number of cross border migration are lack of employment at source (Bangladesh), comparatively high wages at destination (India), low migration cost, porous border and geographic proximity. These migrant workers remain in isolation and poor working condition that led to engage in risky sexual behaviour. They lack spousal communication and consistent condom use. They often pursue sexual relationships with commercial sex workers without condom. There are also incidents of women and girls trafficking across border who are also vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. The EMPHASIS project has been started in 2009. Our goal was to reduce the vulnerability to HIV and AIDS of population mobile between Bangladesh and Nepal to India. And our objective was to demonstrate effective good practice models and for HIV prevention care and support; to enhance capacity of government other service providers; to develop evidence based advocacy. Our project implementation area covers source, transit and destination areas. At the source area we work in Jessore and Satkhira in Bangladesh and Achham and Kanchanpur in Nepal. Transit areas include Jessore/ Satkhira border and West Bengal in case of Bangladeshi migrants. And the destination areas where we work under this project are Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata. In Bangladesh, 82,008 target populations has been reached with health education as of January 2014. We have established two Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) centres in Jessore and Satkhira government hospitals. As of April, 2014, 2184 individuals were diagnosed in these two centres. We got 38 HIV-positive and that is more than 1.5% of total number of tested clients. We have to continue awareness, BCC and counselling activities targeting migrants and their family members using existing GoB health infrastructure as well as to establish and continue HIV testing and counselling services at GoB health facilities in the district with high concentration of migrant populations. Another immediate action would be integration of prevention and referral services including adequate supplies of STI drugs and condoms to all. In the long term we need to ensure migrant rights and entitlements at all levels and universal access to health services. Bilateral dialogues should be held to address the cross border mobility issue. Leo Kenny Leo Kenny, Country Representative, UNAIDS It is really critical in Bangladesh that we do not silo the issue of HIV and migration. It needs to be looked at globally, regionally and locally. Recently, 52 countries have met in Bangladesh to discuss on migration in post 2015. This is a long term issue and it is a global issue. It is about equity, human rights and equality. The work EMPHASIS is doing is not sustainable and it should not be so. This is the job of state to be providing care, support, and treatment to migrants. There are a lot of Bangladeshis in India and they are called Bangle Speaking Population (BSP). It is so stigmatized that they even do not call them Bangladeshis. It is the role of UN to help countries in the region to have inter-country dialogue to ensure safe migration because it is very good for everybody as a choice. Shakirul Islam Shakirul Islam, Chairman, Ovibashi Kormi Unnayan Program ( OKUP) Every year officially 4 lakh people migrate from Bangladesh to overseas. Various research show that migrants are vulnerable to HIV. Migrant workers are cross sectional populations. Many of them are practising MSM behaviour and many women workers are forced into sex work in the overseas. Most of the migrants do not have knowledge about AIDS. We should have very intensive and effective education for potential migrants. There is no referral system for migrants who are often deported for being HIV-positive when they go to renew their visas. These deported migrants often hide their status. So there should be referral system for these HIV-positive migrants. Binoy Krishna Mallick Ms. Mukti, Executive Director, Mukto Akash Bangladesh We are working with PLHIV. We are providing supports to 500 PLHIV. When we refer a patient to clinics for surgery, doctors deny providing health service to a HIV-positive. So PLHIV needs special care and under this project we are trying to fill this gap. Binoy Krishna Mallick Binoy Krishna Mallick, Executive Director, Rights Jessore In the project areas of EMPHASIS there has been significant improvement of peoples consciousness about HIV. So we have to continue this type of initiative in the border areas. Migration is a continuous process and a large share of migration happens through land boundary. Both India and Bangladesh should recognize this reality and come to an agreement to issue work permit to migrant workers. Dr. Tariqul Islam Dr. Tariqul Islam, Deputy Director, Ad-din Welfare Centre We have been working with undocumented migrants. There is a serious gap in awareness about HIV among migrants. Only projects are not adequate .We need strong government intervention to continue mass campaign and awareness building activities among migrants. Dr. SZ Atiq Dr. SZ Atiq, Principal, Satkhira Medical College The establishment of VCT centres in Satkhira and Jessore, initiated by Care Bangladesh and Rights Jessore, is a matter of pride for our health ministry. Since April 2012, 895 patients have come to the VCT centre for voluntary testing in Satkhira. Among them, 16 were HIV-positive. In order to sustain this project, I would urge the government and other stakeholders to continue with this programme. Mahtabul Hakim Mahtabul Hakim, Programme Coordinator, UN Women The issue of cross border migration is of particular importance because earlier on we would hear of migration cases from India but recently more and more cases of emigration to Nepal have emerged. As a result, cross-border migration should be a crucial issue which needs our special attention. I congratulate CARE on the work theyve done so far but I think that if work in this area gets over with the completion of this project then we have cause to worry. The government needs to concentrate on how these works can be brought under its health system. Tarik Hassan Shahriar Tarik Hassan Shahriar, The Daily Sun In the case of cross border migration, both formal and informal migration is part of it. Health is a very significant issue for migrant workers. We have a database for our local workers who travel abroad for work but we dont have any database for returning migrant workers. If we could create a database for returning migrant workers, it would be easy for those working in this area to screen the workers for providing them HIV testing and counselling services. Secondly, stigma discrimination is prevalent in our society and it is a significant barrier in rendering proper medical services to HIV-positive patients. If we could reduce this stigma and gradually eliminate it, we will find out that the number of HIV-positive patients will be much higher. Dr. Tajudeen Oyewale Dr Tajudeen Oyewale, Head of HIV, UNICEF Firstly we need to have a cross border partnership that looks into the health of migrants from source country and also in the destination country. We need cross ministerial walk on that and also the involvement of the foreign affairs ministry. We really need the leadership of the honourable secretary to consider having an integrated centre for HIV and AIDS management in Bangladesh. We dont need many; probably just three to four will be fine. For example, we can have a centre in Dhaka at the BSMMU; they can offer every kind of service related to HIV, irrespective of type, treatment, testing and care. Same thing could be replicated in Khulna and probably in Sylhet and Chittagong as well I will want to use a community based approach because all of us are migrants. We all move from one place to another so you cannot really say that this is one place where you will find migrants but you can say that this is the source community where most migrants that do cross border migration really emerge from, like the work that the EMPHASIS project has done in Satkhira and Jessore. In the context of HIV, we really need to bring a lot of family planning into the work that we do because if you think about a male migrant who has gone out, when he comes back the risk lies with his spouse and with other female partners in the community. Lastly, in migrant communities, we need to think about the children of migrants, their partners and their spouses. Thats where my earlier proposal of integrated centres comes into place. When you have a centre that can do VCT, Prevention of Mother -to -Child Transmission (PMTCT) and monitoring all year around and offer treatments Theresa Blanchet Theresa Blanchet, Director, Drishti Research Centre Every time I hear the numbers of people living with HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh, I think that we are catching only the tip of the iceberg. In our studies, we found that women in Mumbai who found that they were HIV-positive did not return. We heard of cases of women who were staying illegally in Dubai and caught HIV and AIDS committing suicides instead of returning. I dont know where the statistics are for these people. That points out to the huge stigma that this illness bears. The issue of migrant workers and especially female workers, they have really been ignored by everybody except to be beaten up and victimised. Back in 2003-2004, we were in Mumbai when Arab men from Dubai came to recruit bar dancers and it became known that the rate of HIV was very high. Suddenly there was great interest in recruiting girls from Bangladesh as the low prevalence in Bangladesh made it very attractive for them to be hired by those men. We also need to continue with research. Lot of good ideas and intentions were voiced around in this discussion but unless its really grounded in the reality of these migrant workers, you wont go very far. Syed Saiful Haque Syed Saiful Haque, Chairman, WARBE Dev Foundation As cross border migration and HIV vulnerability is an international issue, we need support from our own government as well as international governments. We know that there is a parliamentary caucus on HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh. We now need a grassroots based social structure where all stakeholders can talk and exchange ideas. If we need the focus on this issue to sustain, we cant just depend on a project. Thus, if all those organisations who work on migration can work in a coordinated manner, there would be a real difference. Bangladeshs policy is to export manpower and collect remittance from there but their health issues are ignored. CARE is taking a great initiative but we need to address how we can integrate migrants and health in Sustainable and Development Goal (SDG) or post-MDG, and health and migration policies as well. Hassan Imam Hassan Imam, Programme Coordinator, Migration Programme, BRAC The presentation emphasised on the need for counselling and coordination between the two sectors of migration and health. If we come to the issue of counselling, the recommendations here clearly suggest that both documented and undocumented migrant workers need counselling. There is a gap in coordination between the migration sector and the health sector. We need to do much more work to establish this coordination between the two sectors for the welfare of migrant workers. Dr. Samir Kumar Howlader Dr. Samir Kumar Howlader, National Programme Officer, IOM Migration and cross-border mobility have always remained aside and still there is a gap in policies, collaboration and coordination between the ministry that deals with migration and the ministry of health. There is a health policy but migration is not integrated there or the policy and strategies related to migration does not account for the health issues of migration. Mainstreaming of HIV is very important, and the Ministry of Expatriates Welfare and Overseas Employment should consider this health issue as a mainstream agenda in migration management. Dr. Jahangir Hossain Dr. Jahangir Hossain, Programme Director-Health, Care Bangladesh EMPHASIS is a learning platform to understand the vulnerability of migrant workers and test appropriate approaches, interventions and solutions. This is one of the important events with the participation of important policy makers and practitioners where we are sharing our experiences that we have learned through implementing EMPHASIS regional project of CARE International. The EMPHASIS project was primarily targeting undocumented migrant populations. One project or organisation cant deal with an issue of such magnitude. We need to develop a government response to address this issue. Through EMPHASIS we tried to reach the Cross Border Mobile Population at source using existing health infrastructure structure & system like the community clinics, Community Support Groups, FWC, health complexes and district hospitals. We found out that this approach yielded good results and the HIV prevention knowledge and service uptake level have been increased. This is a tested approach and this can be integrated into existing health systems in the other part of the country. There is a treaty between India and Nepal that if anyone from India is working in Nepal, they have access to services. If someone from Bangladesh works in non-Bengali speaking cities in India, they are always vulnerable often hide their identity as Bangladeshi. Civil Society Organisations working on HIV in India and Bangladesh share information but at the government level it almost absent. The governments need to patronise these civil society organisations for further collaborations. I hope in the future Government and Development Partners will allocate more resources for addressing the vulnerability of migrant workers and their family members at sources, transit and destinations. We are happy that NASP has already allocated some resources on this issue through the World Bank, however, which is too small than the requirement. Hope, MOHFW will allocate more resources in the next operation plan and take leadership to coordinate with other ministries and stakeholders for effective implementation of migration program. M G Mustafa Khan M G Mustafa Khan, Director, BMET, Ministry of Overseas Employment & Expatriates Welfare We need a strong coordination among the ministry of health, the ministry of home affairs and ministry of foreign affairs on cross border migration and HIV issue. I also agree that awareness programmes should be organised in local health centres every month if not every week. I also believe that media has an important role to play in creating awareness. A.K.M Nurun Nabi Professor A.K.M Nurun Nabi, Vice Chancellor, Begum Rokeya University Migration is a social and economic indicator of change. It is inevitable and universal. It is a new phenomenon to look at migration from health perspective. So we have to discuss over it in great length to understand the full gamut of this linkage. I think, the initiation of our HIV programme was on a wrong footing. HIV has become a matter of stigma and fear to general people. Our approach to HIV is guilty of this misrepresentation. HIV should be treated like any other diseases. HIV issue should be assumed in our development paradigm; as such HIV is seriously hindering development efforts of several African countries. I would urge you all to join hand in upcoming ICAAP 12 to make the issue of migration and HIV as an international develop agenda. Dr. Hussain Sarwar Khan Dr. Hussain Sarwar Khan, Line Director, National AIDS/ STD Programme- NASP Migrants are one of the vulnerable communities around the world. We identified the issue in our programmes but could not make any intervention. Now we are preparing a project to do that intervention. In this project we are emphasising on labour migrants and cross border migrants. We have already built up some government infrastructures to provide HIV and STD services. Previously it was NGOs who led the HIV programmes, now the government is going to shoulder the responsibility. M.M Neazuddin M. M. Neazuddin, Secretary Health, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare Though Bangladesh is a low prevalent country we have to do many more things to keep it low . The information of 38 HIV-positive case diagnosed in VCT centre at district Govt. Hospitals of Jessore and Satkhira supported CARE-Bangladesh is really alarming and we have to be really cautious about the issue of cross border migration and their vulnerability of getting infected. We have to immediately take some initiatives for the cross border migrants.

'79pc returnee migrants not aware of HIV infection risks',,,2010-06-03,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a dissemination seminar yesterday said 79 percent of the returnee migrant workers have no knowledge of modes of the HIV transmission that increases the risk of their being infected with the virus. Currently around seven million Bangladeshis are working as migrant worker at around 100 countries and sending remittance worth $10 billion dollars. So, their health, working environment and safety should be ensured, they said. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) commissioned the assessment study titled Situation Assessment of HIV/AIDS related knowledge, picture and services among Bangladeshi migrant workers. The study was conducted on 248 migrant workers from November 2009 to January 2010. It revealed that 57 percent of departing and 58 percent of returnee migrants have no knowledge about sexually transmitted infections. Expressing grave concern over the lack of awareness of the HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases among this group, the speakers stressed the need for special training and orientation to the departing migrant workers. Citing the study, they said only 2 percent of returnee migrants received formal training or orientation on the HIV/AIDS before migration, which is very frustrating. Though Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET) conducts a two-hour pre-departure briefing, the health matters especially the sexually transmitted diseases remain totally absent there, Shakirul Islam, chairman of Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program (OKUP), said while presenting the key findings. ""The health rights of the migrants should be mainstreamed in the health policy as well as in the migration policy of the country,"" said Rabab Fatima, regional representative for South Asia, IOM. Sixty to 70 percent of the total detected HIV positive cases in the country belong to the migrant group, said Dr Salil Panakadan, country coordinator of UNAIDS, stressing the need for preparing the migrants to face the vulnerabilities of the virus in the destination countries. Both the sending and the host countries have responsibilities to protect the rights of migrant workers and there should have accessible information centres for them. The Bangladesh missions in receiving countries also can play an important role in giving orientation to the workers, he added.

Increase in participation of men a must to prevent HIV,,,2009-11-09,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a roundtable yesterday emphasised the need for participation of men to prevent the deadly disease HIV/AIDS in order to ensure gender equality and reproductive health rights. They were speaking at the roundtable titled Involvement of men in successful prevention of HIV jointly organised by the Prothom Alo and UNFPA at the newspapers office at Karwan Bazar in the city. Abdul Qayyum, joint editor of the daily, moderated the roundtable. Dr Khandaker Ezazul Haque, HIV focal point of UNFPA Bangladesh, recommended increase of the male participation for safer sex which will prevent HIV/AIDS and also work to stop the disease spreading. Director HIV/AIDS sector and South Asia Programme Adviser of Save the Children-USA Nizamuddin Ahmed appreciated some measures of the government to fight HIV, especially the step to include a chapter on HIV/AIDS from class six to twelve to inform the young generation about the disease. Project Coordinator of CARE Bangladesh Kalpana Rani said women rights activists call for male participation in ensuring their rights, adding that it is now time for males to ensure safer sex to prevent HIV/AIDS also. “As the males have more access to get involved in more females at a time, that might be risky to get infectious of sexuality transmitted infection, including HIV, and they can spread it to each of his partner and that could spread among vast number of people,” she added. She also called on the sex sellers to be more responsible for stopping spread of any infectious diseases. Executive Director of Bandhu Social Welfare Society Saleh Ahmed discussed the availability of condom and its promotion to stop sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV. Executive Director of Ashar Alo Society Habiba Akter explained the situation of the expatriated workers and several cases among the women HIV positives who are mainly infected by their expatriated husbands or male sex partners for ignorance. Describing the situation of sex workers and number of their clients, HIV/AIDS Adviser of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Mozammel Haque said if the male as well as the sex seller does not practise safe sex, they might be infected with HIV and they will also spread it to others.

Cuba stamps out mother-to-child HIV,"Cuba successfully eliminates mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.",,2015-07-01,The Daily Star,"Cuba has successfully eliminated mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. The head of the WHO, Dr Margaret Chan, called it one of the greatest public health achievements possible. It follows years of efforts to give pregnant women early access to prenatal care, testing and drugs to stop these diseases passing from mother to child. The WHO hopes other countries will be able to achieve the same. Eliminating infections Every year, globally, around 1.4 million women living with HIV become pregnant. Untreated, they have a 15-45% chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. That risk drops to about 1% if antiretroviral medicines are given to both mothers and their babies. And each year, nearly a million pregnant women worldwide are infected with syphilis. Again, early screening and treatment of these women can avoid complications for their unborn children. In Cuba, according to the available official data, less than 2% of children whose mothers have HIV are born with the virus - the lowest rate possible with the available prevention methods. Globally, seven in every 10 pregnant women living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries receive effective antiretroviral medicines to prevent transmission of the virus to their children. Among the 22 countries that account for 90% of new HIV infections, eight have already reduced new HIV infections among children by more than 50% since 2009 (based on 2013 data) and another four are close to this mark, the WHO says. And by 2014, more than 40 countries were testing 95% or more of pregnant women in prenatal care for syphilis. But experts say many countries must still do more to prevent and treat syphilis. Dr Carissa Etienne, of the Pan American Health Organization, which has been working with the WHO, said: ""Cubas achievement today provides inspiration for other countries to advance towards elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.""",{},"['virus', 'stamps', 'women', 'transmission', 'health', 'cuba', 'testing', 'hiv', 'children', 'syphilis', 'pregnant', 'countries', 'mothertochild']","Cuba has successfully eliminated mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.

Child gives hope to HIV positive parents,"The boy looks as healthy, energetic and cheerful as most children at 7. But before he was born, his mother kept her fingers crossed that her HIV would not pass on to the child.",,2016-03-22,The Daily Star,"The boy looks as healthy, energetic and cheerful as most children at 7. But before he was born, his mother kept her fingers crossed that her HIV would not pass on to the child. Thanks to constant medical care and close monitoring of the mother during pregnancy and afterwards, an antibody test into the 18th month of the delivery revealed that the baby was not infected by the much-feared human immunodeficiency virus. Now the little kid has grown up to study in the second grade. Not only his mother, his father had also tested positive for AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) before their marriage. They married in 2007, despite having such a fatal illness, after developing affection for each other. The boy is now the couples world of love and happiness. ""None on this earth was as happy as we were after knowing that our child had no HIV,” the 26-year-old mother told The Daily Star. The parents have been taking medicines regularly to suppress the virus in their bodies. During pregnancy, she continued having those drugs. After birth, the baby was given syrup for six weeks and then another medicine for one year, said his father, at 38 years old. The family was provided with the treatment under a pilot project of Marie Stopes Bangladesh, an NGO that gives sexual and reproductive healthcare, said Habiba Akhter, executive director of Ashar Alo Society, which coordinates health services to HIV patients. Currently, HIV positive mothers are receiving treatment under the ""Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV"" project at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka, Chittagong Medical College Hospital, and Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, said Dr Marina Akhtar, programme manager of the project. As many as 61 women with AIDS have been treated during pregnancy since the introduction of the project in May 2013, she said, and 46 of them so far gave birth to healthy babies, meaning they do not have AIDS. It was confirmed that they were clean only after the DNA Polymer Chain Reaction test. Seven other women had miscarriages and seven are still under observation, the doctor said, adding that one baby could not be saved from the infection due to late detection of the disease of the mother. Once a pregnant woman is diagnosed with HIV she is immediately given antiretroviral therapy that suppresses HIV. After birth, babies, whose parents have AIDS, are given Nevirapine syrup, also a suppressive drug, for six weeks. Then babies are given co-trimoxazole for one year when they are fed breast milk, said Prof Dr Saleha Begum Chowdhury, director of the project. A baby goes through the DNA Polymer Chain Reaction test twice -- at six week old and at thirteen and a half month old, confirming that the baby is free of HIV, the project director said. Apart from pregnant women, antiretroviral therapy is given free to all HIV patients for life, she added. In Bangladesh, mothers with HIV are not forbidden to breastfeed their babies. “We allow them to feed their babies breast milk, considering their economic condition,” Prof Saleha said, adding in many parts of the world HIV positive mothers are not allowed to do so as there is a risk of transmission. With the risk eliminated, motherhood gives hopes to HIV positive women facing the fear of death and the stigma attached to the disease. “My life suddenly lost all meaning as I was diagnosed with AIDS. I thought I was going to die within a short time,” said the mother. Except for her family, whoever learnt about her disease hated her, she said. “I feel so blessed whenever I look at my sons face.” The couple have been blessed with another child, a baby girl, last month.",{},"['babies', 'hope', 'positive', 'baby', 'women', 'project', 'mother', 'parents', 'child', 'hiv', 'given', 'medical', 'gives', 'aids']","But before he was born, his mother kept her fingers crossed that her HIV would not pass on to the child.

5m HIV-positives in Asia,,,2008-11-27,The Daily Star,"An estimated nine million Asians have been infected with HIV since its first appearance in the region more than 20 years ago, while approximately 2.6 million men, 950,000 women and 330,000 children have so far died of AIDS- related disease, says a report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia. The number of people living with HIV in Asia was 4.9 million in 2007 including 440,000 people who are newly infected while the number of people died from AIDS-related illness was 300,000 last year. The report said despite the progress made in many Asian countries and declining trend of new HIV infection, AIDS accounts for more deaths annually among the 15 to 44-year-old adults currently than do tuberculosis and other diseases. The main causes for spreading HIV/AIDS in the Asian countries include unprotected paid sex, sharing of contaminated needles and syringes and unprotected sex between men, according to the report. The commission recommended an increase of condom use among sex workers, their clients and the male having sex with male (MSM) to over 80 percent, and halve sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and needle sharing among the injective drug users (IDUs) between 2008 and 2020. If the target can be achieved, it would reduce infections by five million, number of people living with HIV by 3.1 million, number of AIDS-related deaths by 40 percent and a steady decline in HIV prevalence in the region by 2020, it added. The launching ceremony of The AIDS Commission Report: Redefining AIDS in Asia was held at Sasakawa auditorium of ICDDR,B in the city. The Centre for Gender, Sexuality and HIV/AIDS, a UNAIDS Collaborating Centre, and James P Grant School of Public Health at Brac University organised the launching programme. The report said many Asian countries have established National AIDS Commissions but they have not been able to effectively coordinate the AIDS responses in their countries for lack of mandate, secretarial support and overall direction by the top level political functionaries. Though 14 Asian countries have national strategic plans, most of the plans lack key planning components for the operation, management and financing of the responses, it added. The report revealed that low level of condom use during paid sex contributes to increasing HIV infection in the region. Though three out of four adults living with HIV in Asia are men, the proportion of women has risen from 19 percent in 2000 to 24 percent in 2007. Geeta Sethi, APLF Coordinator of Regional Support Team, Asia and the Pacific, Joint United Nations Programme of HIV/AIDS, presented an overview of the report that highlighted the state of the AIDS epidemic in Asia, national responses, community involvement, the future of the epidemic in Asia, money needed to curb HIV and strategies and implementation of programmes.

People with HIV/AIDS still face social stigma,,,2009-08-16,The Daily Star,"People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) are still facing discrimination in society that even forces them not to seek treatment in the healthcare centres, a study revealed yesterday. The study titled People living with HIV stigma index conducted on 238 HIV positive people revealed that 16.8 percent of them decided not to go to a hospital when they needed to do so because of the discriminatory attitude of most of the health providers. UNAIDS, James P Grant School of Public Health of Brac University, Ashar Alo Society and Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB) jointly carried out the study. The dissemination programme was held at Spectra Convention Centre in the city. The study showed that some 84.9 percent of the HIV carriers decided not to have more children because of their uncertain future, while 70 percent of them feel ashamed for their HIV status. The social stigma is so deep-routed in the society that 21 percent PLHIV still believes that they should commit suicide.

"The Paris Statement: ""HIV Science Matters""","Scientific knowledge is the backbone of the HIV response. Over the past 30 years, scientific research has shaped and influenced our",,2017-07-30,The Daily Star,"Scientific knowledge is the backbone of the HIV response. Over the past 30 years, scientific research has shaped and influenced our understanding and management of HIV and has pointed continually to better ways to reduce or prevent HIV-related illnesses, improve lives for people living with HIV and prevent new infections. Science drives the HIV response. Yet the extraordinary scientific progress against HIV and the ability to address all of the scientific challenges still are threatened by a weakening resolve to fund HIV science. We cannot achieve ambitious global goals, provide life-long treatment to the 37 million people living with HIV and reduce the epidemic without an unfaltering commitment to research. Progress in HIV science has far-reaching synergistic effects across public health, informing and supporting the response to other disease areas. Political commitment to sustained and predictable investment in a robust HIV science agenda must be strengthened to ensure that scientific progress against the epidemic is maximised and that gains are not lost. Understanding HIV and its interactions with its host at the most fundamental level requires continuing investment in basic science. Current research priorities include the analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HIV persistence and viral control. To enhance research efforts towards an HIV cure, animal models and promising new technologies must be funded. Controlling the global epidemic requires a vaccine and an ongoing and consistent commitment to investigating new approaches to vaccine development for both prophylactic and therapeutic use. Research efforts must include the characterisation of different cellular and humoral immune responses to be harnessed in the development of preventive vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies. Improving HIV treatment options and outcomes for the millions of people who need it requires research on drug formulations and adherence support. These efforts should prioritise the development of antiretroviral (ARV) formulations that support long-term adherence and reduce the risk of viral resistance. Cooperation between HIV, TB and cryptococcosis research programmes must be promoted. Implementation science must continue to inform retention approaches across “Test-Treat-Retain”, including new modalities for repeat testing in high-incidence settings, routine viral load monitoring, improved client adherence strategies and the adoption of differentiated service delivery models. Prevention options must be accessible to and useful for the people who need them most. Investment in prevention and overcoming structural barriers should focus on improving access to diversified prevention tools, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), for people most vulnerable to HIV infection. Prevention research must continue to support the development and scale up of combination prevention, notably for key populations, migrants and the younger generation with a gender-sensitive approach. Research priorities in the humanities and social sciences must address stigma and discrimination and identify tailored approaches to reduce the drivers of the epidemic. Beyond the laboratory and clinical trial setting, investments that better explore economics and financing are essential to supporting a sustained response and the creation of innovative financing models. Research must continue to inform thinking on pricing models for HIV diagnostics and medicines, as well as treatments for co-infections, that are modified in particular for low- and middle-income countries and take into consideration the expanded role of generics and bio-equivalents. Political and economic sciences must focus on existing financing gaps and work towards models that expand universal health coverage. The HIV epidemic is far from over. Expanding the evidence base to guide policy and programme decisions is a key component in addressing critical research gaps. Multi-disciplinary approaches and research programmes adapted to a range of social and cultural contexts must be allowed to flourish; participatory and community-based research must be strengthened; and the meaningful involvement of key populations and people living with HIV in shaping research priorities must remain an unwavering principle.

HIV/AIDS: No longer a death sentence?,,,2013-12-01,The Daily Star,"Scientific breakthroughs have helped us chart an impressive course to the HIV/AIDS response such that in the fourth decade of the epidemic, we are already talking of ending AIDS. A death sentence at the outset, HIV is now a chronic disease. It is unique in the sense that vaccine for this communicable disease still eludes us and cure is yet not possible. Despite this, we have been able to not only control but have also managed to reverse the epidemic in large parts of the globe. For us to reach this stage, contributions have come from a wide variety of stakeholders -- national governments who have provided the leadership; funding agencies that spearheaded the response and needed research; development agencies including the UN that collaborated and joined forces to support countries in addressing the epidemic and last but not the least communities who continue to relentlessly fight for the right to affordable and equitable access to treatment and without whom we would not be where we are today. Moving ahead, we need to ensure that the bio-medical response addresses both prevention and treatment. The division is now more blurred than ever with the scientific advances that have firmly positioned treatment as prevention. Starting treatment early not only improves quality and longevity for the infected individual but also prevents further transmission to partners. With effective HIV control, we have been able to reduce the number of direct HIV related deaths and adverse outcomes. As people continue to live longer on antiretroviral treatment, not only do they face the common problems of aging like non-HIV population, they are at heightened risk of non-AIDS conditions such as heart disease due to persistent inflammation. These conditions, so far mostly studied in the US and Europe are now becoming important in the developing world. These additional co-morbidities and the shift of HIV care to chronic disease management could overburden already stretched health care systems. These could be addressed if we were to find a potent vaccine to prevent HIV and cure for HIV once infected. A number of cases, including the so-called “Berlin patient” the “Mississippi baby”, and the “Visconti” cohort, have given us hope and impetus in our search for HIV cure. Our quest for a vaccine continues. However, realistically speaking, a scalable cure or a vaccine is not foreseen in the near future. Until then, we must continue and enhance our efforts to ensure that health systems are prepared to safely and effectively deliver long-term chronic HIV and related care. We must not forget that bio-medical interventions alone will not take us to the finish line. In order to achieve an AIDS free world, we need to blend the bio-medical and social-behavioural interventions that ensure universal access to prevention and care of HIV in a health and social system that respects human rights, sexual diversity and gender equity.

Awareness a must to prevent HIV/AIDS,,,2008-11-26,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a discussion yesterday said though the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is still only one percent, there is nothing to be contented as Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries for its geographical location, huge population and low-level educational status. It is time to disseminate complete messages among the people about HIV/AIDS properly so that they could be empowered and build strong resistance in the community against the disease, they added. Styled Empowerment and Service Delivery: AIDS Perspective Bangladesh, the discussion was organised by the daily Prothom Alo at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in the city. The speakers said the HIV situation in the country is far better than that of its neighbouring countries due to its culture, religious barrier and awareness campaign taken by the government and non-government organisations. “We need not to be panicked, but we must understand that it is time for raising awareness of HIV/AIDS at every level as still very few people know about the causes of AIDS, how to prevent it and who the vulnerable groups are,” they added. They said around four crore people are aged between 15 and 24 in the country. In 50 percent cases, the disease spreads through the people who belong to this age group. So, more attention should be given to the people belonging to this age brackets. Quoting a research finding, HIV/AIDS Sector Director of Save the Children USA Dr Nezam Uddin Ahmed said 90 percent children have ever heard about HIV/AIDS but only 25 percent of them know how it spreads. While two percent are going through a denial phase who think that they would not get infected with HIV/AIDS. Presenting a keynote paper, he said, “So, it is important to disseminate total messages among this group through proper channel,” adding that it is good that the government has introduced the issue of HIV/AIDS in school curriculum from grade 6 to 12. It would force the students to know about AIDS and take preventive measures and at the same time teachers training in this regard would also be helpful for the students in getting clear messages, he added. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Vice Chancellor Prof Nazrul Islam underscored the importance of providing proper care and treatment for the people living with HIV/AIDS or get HIV infected. “They should be taken care of for ensuring a better life while they must be registered and observed so that they cannot spread the deadly virus,” he said, adding that sex workers, injective drug users, males having sex with males, migrant and garment workers are belonging to most vulnerable groups and attention should be paid much to these groups especially. There are more than one lakh sex workers in the country. Every sex worker attends some five customers on an average every day and if the workers get infected with the disease, they would transmit the disease to five lakh people every day, he added. The speakers called on all to be a responsible citizen, live healthy life and take measures to prevent the disease like using condom during sexual intercourse, screening blood during blood transfusion and maintaining the religious norms. At the same time, the government should consider AIDS as a threat to the nation and move forward to address the issue with due commitment, they said, adding that mass media can also play an important role. Moderated by Dr Abdun Noor Tushar, the discussion was also addressed by Editor of the Prothom Alo Matiur Rahman, NASP Line Director Dr Md Ishak Khan, Treasurer of STD/AIDS Network Dr Nazneen Akhter, Executive Director of Ashar Alo Society Habiba Akter, Awami League leader Dr Dipu Moni, Shahnaz Begum of Durjay Nari Sangha and cultural activist Nasiruddin Yusuf Bachchu also spoke the discussion.",{},"['prevent', 'workers', 'discussion', 'hivaids', 'vulnerable', 'speakers', 'disease', 'sex', 'awareness', 'aids', 'dr', 'messages']","It is time to disseminate complete messages among the people about HIV/AIDS properly so that they could be empowered and build strong resistance in the community against the disease, they added. “We need not to be panicked, but we must understand that it is time for raising awareness of HIV/AIDS at every level as still very few people know about the causes of AIDS, how to prevent it and who the vulnerable groups are,” they added.

Don't 'walk away' on AIDS,Bill Clinton pleaded with the world Friday not to abandon the campaign to rein in the HIV virus which still kills nearly a million people every year and infects twice as many.,,2018-07-29,The Daily Star,"Bill Clinton pleaded with the world Friday not to abandon the campaign to rein in the HIV virus which still kills nearly a million people every year and infects twice as many. The world must ""hold the line"" until a vaccine or cure is found, or face ""calamitous"" consequences, the US ex-president told the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam ""There can be no Brexit in the fight against AIDS,"" said the founder of the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, referring to Britains decision to leave the European Union. He cited UN data showing that 1.8 million people were newly infected in 2017 with the immune system-wrecking virus that causes AIDS. The year saw 940,000 deaths. Decades of research have yet to yield a cure or vaccine for HIV, which has infected almost 80 million people and killed 35.4 million since the early 1980s. ""I am pleading with you,"" Clinton told the final day of the conference which saw some 15,000 delegates -- researchers, activists, and people living with HIV -- rub shoulders with celebrity activists Charlize Theron, Elton John, Prince Harry, and Conchita. ""It is something you cant walk away from,"" the statesman insisted. Speaker after speaker in Amsterdam warned there was a high risk of losing control of the epidemic, with infections rising in some 50 countries as anti-AIDS funding dwindled. Eastern Europe and central Asia saw a 30-percent surge in new HIV cases since 2010, which researchers say is fuelled by repressive laws leaving intravenous drug users without access to clean needles or help. For Clinton, the most important message is to not give up on research, funding, and rolling out prevention and treatment.",{},"['dont', 'virus', 'clinton', 'million', 'saw', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'world', 'told', 'researchers', 'aids', 'walk', 'away']","Bill Clinton pleaded with the world Friday not to abandon the campaign to rein in the HIV virus which still kills nearly a million people every year and infects twice as many.

HIV evolving into milder form: study,,,2014-12-03,The Daily Star,"HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study. The team at the University of Oxford shows the virus is being ""watered down"" as it adapts to our immune systems. It said it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause Aids and that the changes in the virus may help efforts to contain the pandemic. Some virologists suggest the virus may eventually become ""almost harmless"" as it continues to evolve. More than 35 million people around the world are infected with HIV and inside their bodies a devastating battle takes place between the immune system and the virus. HIV is a master of disguise. It rapidly and effortlessly mutates to evade and adapt to the immune system. However, every so often HIV infects someone with a particularly effective immune system. ""[Then] the virus is trapped between a rock and hard place, it can get flattened or make a change to survive and if it has to change then it will come with a cost,"" said Prof Philip Goulder, from the University of Oxford. The ""cost"" is a reduced ability to replicate, which in turn makes the virus less infectious and means it takes longer to cause Aids. This weakened virus is then spread to other people and a slow cycle of ""watering-down"" HIV begins. The team showed this process happening in Africa by comparing Botswana, which has had an HIV problem for a long time, and South Africa where HIV arrived a decade later. Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""If the trend continues then we might see the global picture change - a longer disease causing much less transmission. ""In theory, if we were to let HIV run its course then we would see a human population emerge that was more resistant to the virus than we collectively are today - HIV infection would eventually become almost harmless. ""Such events have probably happened throughout history, but we are talking very large timescales.""",{},"['virus', 'place', 'university', 'change', 'longer', 'immune', 'milder', 'team', 'hiv', 'form', 'infectious', 'takes', 'evolving', 'study']","HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study.

Impacts of AIDS on social capital,,,2010-12-01,The Daily Star,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Aids) Day is observed on December 1. It is time for us to ponder over our present situation and the link between Aids and development because it has the potential to debilitate and even thwart the process of development itself. Aids is caused by deficiency of the immune system, which stems from infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This pandemic has the potential of affecting our society in a very adverse way, as determinants of HIV are highly prevalent in our society, which portends an ominous future for us. Bangladesh still has a relatively low level of HIV affected people in the most-at-risk population groups, with the exception of injecting drug users (IDU) where prevalence is on a rising trend. According to an estimate by UNAIDS about 12,000 Bangladeshis were infected with HIV at the end of 2007. Although overall HIV prevalence remains under 0.1% among the general population in Bangladesh, there are risk factors that could fuel the spread of HIV among high-risk groups. The HIV/Aids epidemic has an insidious effect on the economic and social welfare of any country. This is especially true for those weak economies that are generally characteristics of countries with high HIV prevalence. This is where we can draw comfort, as it seems that Bangladesh with a low prevalence should not worry about it. But a closer inspection may reveal otherwise. If we consider the determinants and one of the most affected groups only, we may get an indication of an alarming future for us. First, we will consider the spread of Aids through sexual transmission among migrant workers. Bangladeshs economy is mainly consumption-based and is seeing a healthy growth in remittance thanks to the back-breaking toil of our migrant brothers and sisters. A good number among them stay in the foreign countries for most part of their life. The concentration of male migrant workers increases the demand for commercial sex and helps in facilitating the spread of HIV (Hunt, 1989). As more and more people are going abroad every year, the threat is only compounding. In most cases, these migrants are the only bread earners of their families, and studies show that if the infected person is the breadwinner the family suffers financially due to the loss of earnings and increased expenditure for medical care (United Nations, 2004). During the period of illness and after the death of the victim, lack of income and the cost of care can force households to spend their savings, sell their productive assets and borrow money. This causes many Aids affected households to make a rapid transition into poverty. Reduced levels of consumption in Aids-affected households, including reduced food consumption, may also result in malnutrition (United Nations, 2004). Our migrant labour force faces the danger of contracting Aids because of various reasons, ranging from sexual transmission, exposure to blood, to gender inequities, mobility etc. This could put our country in jeopardy and GDP could be reduced due to the deaths of these active people because of Aids. The loss of social capital or the long-term adverse effect on human capital is not taken into account when the impacts of Aids are estimated. The effects of lowered investment in the human capital of younger generations will affect economic performance in the future. Aids normally affects those who have the fewest economic and social resources. It deepens poverty and increases the number of the poor at risk of infection, because those with the fewest resources have the least access to health-care services or health-related information. When we talk about the effect of HIV/Aids epidemic on development, we normally consider material advancement or achievement only. But development is a holistic concept covering social advancement also. A nations attainment of a long and healthy life for its population is one of the main defining features of successful development. The effect of the epidemic on mortality itself represents a loss of welfare and a loss of GDP (Jamison, Sachs and Wang, 2001). Along with its effects on GDP, HIV/Aids is likely to increase income inequality and poverty. It changes and impoverishes households and weakens inter-generational support systems. If HIV becomes highly prevalent in rural areas, it will cause a reduction in agricultural production, which will lead to food insecurity. Its deadly effect just does not end there as it also strains health-care resources; erodes educational progress and, with diminished labour force, can increase costs for businesses. HIV/Aids reduces investment in human capital and has profound and long-lasting effects on a countrys social and economic development. HIV/Aids represents a significant barrier to development on a number of dimensions. The implications of the disease in terms of productivity, human capital and savings imply a manifold detrimental effect for any society. As a developing country, low prevalence of HIV in Bangladesh just might be the tip of an iceberg. So it is high time we took appropriate measures for stopping this epidemic and for cautioning the younger generation against this deadly blight.

Fight for the people with HIV/AIDS,,,2008-11-29,The Daily Star,"For many of us, December 1 will be just like any other day. But millions of people living with HIV/AIDS around the world will be looking towards us to stand up beside them, call for action and help stop their sufferings. Each year on December 1 the world celebrates World AIDS Day. Yet, thousands of people in the country infected with the virus face social discrimination and stigma from different fonts. According to Human Rights Watch, ""People living with HIV/AIDS and those thought to be infected have been imprisoned, assaulted and even murdered.” The stigma of AIDS has taken many lives before the disease itself killed them. But the reasons behind the suicides and extent of this have rarely come to our knowledge. Society’s limited understanding of this disease is causing innocent people to pay a terrible price. Increasingly across the world, there are voices questioning in one angle. They question the narrow approach to a single disease, especially the huge financing for AIDS over all else in basic health care. Our approach to this disease needs to change for the sake of our people, our brothers and our sisters who are fighting against odds. Social factors like discrimination, stigmatisation and rejection have pushed people living with HIV to become desperate and feel hopeless, to the extent of giving up their life. They face discrimination and lack of support not only from the society but also from his/her own family. ""I have actually seen how lack of support and stigma really makes to lose hope. How can we live if nobody is willing to listen to our problems?"" said one of the victims in a rehabilitation centre in the city. They are also being confined from friends, scared for losing their jobs. This made them to live in phobia and their condition become worse as they need proper and adequate treatment that could provide them with better life. Most of these people are not getting proper medical and nursing care as stigma is attached so strongly to this illness that even some well educated people refuse to serve them. Many are afraid of consulting the doctors as they did not wish other people to know about their predicament. According to the experts, with the existing treatment, people with HIV can lead a normal life like the others particularly if they receive good support from their family members, especially their parents. The situation is aggravated by the fact that major percentage of the HIV positive individuals are injectable drug users (IDUs), who are marginalised by society and criminalised by the law. HIV/AIDS has already been concentrated epidemic among the IDUs. They must be taken under rehabilitation to stop the spread of this threat. Conditions of women living with HIV/AIDS are dismal. Women are blamed for carrying the infection, even though they may have got the virus from their partners (in most cases husbands). Instances have been reported, where husbands abandon their ailing wives and children to find another wife. Due to the fear of social and family desertion, women are hesitant to disclose their HIV/AIDS status. Also, disclosure may lead to loss of job and reputations. This fear and dithering will make women an easy target of violence and abuse. Now is the high time for everybody to make a cumulative move and put in a fair share of effort in building effective policies and laws, in changing social attitude which enable the people living with HIV/AIDS to live and enjoy the rights as any other citizen of Bangladesh.",{},"['support', 'women', 'social', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'hiv', 'living', 'world', 'stigma', 'live', 'fight']","But millions of people living with HIV/AIDS around the world will be looking towards us to stand up beside them, call for action and help stop their sufferings.

Research found breakthrough treatment of HIV/AIDS,,,2010-02-13,The Daily Star,"Since the detection of HIV virus in 1983, scientists and researchers are trying hard to invent and explore effective weapons to fight with the deadly disease. AIDS takes away millions of lives as there is no specific treatment for cure or vaccine to prevent transmission of HIV. In quest to combat HIV/AIDS, a recent research has revealed breakthrough findings to protect body from infection. The research team headed by Mojgan Naghavi, at University college, Dublin in Ireland have found that neurons (brain cells) can protect themselves against infections from HIV. A protein molecule named FEZ-1 uniquely made by neurons plays the key role. The protein appears to lock out the HIV virus. They are pining their hope to produce treatments to thwart HIV by using gene therapy or drugs to activate production of FEZ-1 in cells other than neurons, especially the white blood cells most vulnerable to infection by the virus. Naghavi and her colleagues established the protective effects of FEZ-1 by blocking the gene that makes it in human neurons. This made the neurons vulnerable to infection. Likewise, the team blocked infection that would normally occurs in other types of brain cells, such as microglia, by genetically engineering them to produce FEZ-1. They are now hoping to achieve the same thing in macrophages, a type of white blood cell. The article is compiled by Md Jakir Hossain, a student of Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology at University of Chittagong.",{},"['virus', 'infection', 'breakthrough', 'cells', 'university', 'hivaids', 'vulnerable', 'team', 'hiv', 'white', 'research', 'treatment', 'neurons', 'fez1']","Since the detection of HIV virus in 1983, scientists and researchers are trying hard to invent and explore effective weapons to fight with the deadly disease.

Elimination of HIV and syphilis in Cuba,Cuba became the first country in the world to receive validation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has eliminated mother-,,2015-08-09,The Daily Star,"Cuba became the first country in the world to receive validation from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that it has eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. Every year, globally, an estimated 1.4 million women living with HIV become pregnant. Untreated, they have a 15-45% chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. However, that risk drops to just over 1% if antiretroviral medicines are given to both mothers and children throughout the stages when infection can occur. Nearly 1 million pregnant women worldwide are infected with syphilis annually. However, simple, cost-effective screening and treatment options during pregnancy, such as penicillin, can eliminate most of these complications. Mother-to-child transmission of these diseases is considered eliminated when the rates of infection are brought to levels so low as to be considered no longer a public health problem. In the case of HIV, this is defined as fewer than 2 in every 100 babies born to women with HIV, which is the lowest rate considered possible with the prevention methods currently available. In the case of syphilis, elimination is defined as less than 1 case for every 2,000 live births. As part of the regional initiative, Cuba has worked to ensure early access to prenatal care, HIV and syphilis testing for both pregnant women and their partners, treatment for women who test positive and their babies, substitution of breastfeeding, and prevention of HIV and syphilis before and during pregnancy through condom use and other prevention measures.

Vienna selected to host international conference on HIV/AIDS in 2010,,,2008-05-24,The Daily Star,"Citys proximity to eastern europe and central asia, and strong commitment to HIV by government, scientists and civil society among the reasons vienna selected to host XVIII international AIDS conference Vienna, Austria has been chosen to host the XVIII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2010), the largest international meeting on HIV, where every two years 25,000 participants representing all stakeholders in the global response to HIV meet to assess progress and identify future priorities. Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the International AIDS Society (IAS) is the worlds leading independent association of HIV professionals. “The International AIDS Society and its partners are extremely pleased to partner with the City of Vienna, the Government of Austria and local scientific and community leaders, who have a long history of leadership on HIV issues,"" said IAS President-elect, Dr. Julio Montaner, Director of the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS and International Conference Chair for AIDS 2010. ""Because the 2010 conference will coincide with the deadline that world leaders set for the goal of providing universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, all eyes of the world will be upon Vienna.” Dr. Montanersaid, ""The conference is an opportunity to look specifically at the challenges facing the emerging epidemics in Eastern Europe in the context of hardest hit regions around the world and the overall global response.” ""The International AIDS Conference is the most important gathering for the release and discussion of scientific, programmatic and policy developments in the global response to HIV/AIDS. As the largest and most diverse international gathering devoted to a global health issue, the conference brings together the movement of people responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic to share their lessons and together stake out the road ahead. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), an estimated 150,000 people in Eastern Europe and Central Asia were newly infected with HIV in 2007 bringing the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the region to 1.6 million. This compares with 630,000 PLHIV in 2001, an increase of 150%. Worldwide, an estimated 33.2 million people are living with HIV and more than 2.1 million people died of AIDS in 2007. AIDS 2010 will be held from 18 to 23 July 2010 at the Reed Messe Wien. It will be the eighteenth in this series of international AIDS conferences. In August 2008, it will be held in Mexico City, Mexico, and the previous meeting was held in Toronto, Canada in 2006.

HIV/AIDS: Hold the scourge at bay,,,2008-07-12,The Daily Star,"THE recent survey report by the National AIDSSTD Works Programme on the spread of HIV infection in a section of the intravenous drug users ( IDU ) in a certain area of Dhaka city is alarming. The report indicated that the prevalence of HIV among such drug users has reached as high as 10.5 per cent in that area (the name of the area has not been made public) of the city. ICDDR, B conducted the survey by collecting blood sample of more than 10,000 IDUs in selected 19 areas of the country and the result indicated HIV infection among such users to be less than I per cent but the average infection rate among IDUs in the Dhaka city has been found to be 7 per cent and in a certain area as high as said above. With prevalence rate of 5 per cent or more considered as epidemic for any disease, the large incidence of HIV infection in a concentrated population in the city is a chilling message to all vitally linked with the development of the country. While epidemiologists have long labeled Africa as a time bomb for the outbreak of afflictions such as AIDS, much of the world, more specifically India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Mynamar remained somewhat indifferent to the regions plight. The situation is set to change with a new World Bank report that brings the threat of AIDS closer to home. The infection rate in Asia, says the report, will dwarf the health crisis Africans suffered over the past 15 years. According to the report, there are more than 8 million people infected with HIV or AIDS in Asia. Whats worse, the number is expected to jump dramatically in the near future. The reason for the new outbreaks, says the report, is that most of Southeast Asia has reached a concentrated stage of infection. This means that the disease has reached high levels among those most at risk -- intravenous drug users and sex workers, -- and is set to creep into the rest of society. Speaking about India, on the most conservative of estimates, as per statistics taken in 2004, more than 600,000 already have the disease and more than 5m are infected with HIV. That means India ranks second only to South Africa in terms of its number of infections. If Indias rate were to rise by just a few percentage points, not only would millions more there be condemned to live with -- or more likely die of -- AIDS, but so would millions of its neighbours, especially Bangladesh with 4222 km porous land border put to the risk. Precisely true, no country is condemned to follow Africa into an AIDS cauldron. The policies adopted by not so distant Thailand have the greatest relevance for us. The Thais adopted six policies in particular : evaluation and monitoring of the outbreak, a concentration of efforts on high risk groups, general education about HIV and AIDS, combined with a 100 per cent condom use programme and a campaign to dispel with the stigma associated with the disease, collaboration with as many people as possible on all fronts, international support and political will. Understandably, the growing number of HIV cases in India calls for stepping up efforts to halt the spread of the disease in our country through cross-border transmissions. The most worrying aspect is the trafficking of teenage girls to India who after being coerced into sex trade, eventually come back to Bangladesh with high probability of carrying with them the treaded HIV infection. The Home Advisers disclosure while inaugurating a new police investigation unit formed to strengthen fight against human trafficking in the city in the recent past as reported in The Daily Star on June 18 last that every day about 50 Bangladeshi women were trafficked to India came as a bewildering shock to the nation. It was stated in the report that 400,000 Bangladeshi women were engaged in forced prostitution in India. The report further added that 40,000 female children were exploited in Pakistan. Reports carried by a Chennai (India) based AIDS Research and Education Centre revealed that the centre was treating two sons of a wealthy industrialist for AIDS. The sons admitted that they had unprotected sex with “high class” call girls before and after marriage. Neither believed that there was any risk involved so long as they kept away from the official red light areas. “ Now their wives are also infected,” said the director of the centre glumly. Heterosexual transmission now accounts for over two-thirds of all HIV positive cases in underdeveloped countries like India, Uganda and other African countries. Contrarily, in Thailand just within three years since the beginning of 1996 the number of infected cases shot up from 1000 to 50,000 through intravenous drug users like that we see in Bangladesh now. Referring to the high incidence of HIV infection in an area of the city Dr. Nazrul Islam, an eminent HIV/ AIDS expert and Professor of Virology at BSMMUH said, “Its a concentrated epidemic in a small area and must be construed as a red alert for a densely populated small country like Bangladesh. Either in India or Uganda or Thailand or our own country what we have got to be worried of is that promiscuity is the single most important way by which the epidemic spreads. One reason for its rapid dissemination is that symptoms take an average five years to show up, so an afflicted person can pass the virus unknowingly to scores of people. Moreover the middle class seldom believed that it was vulnerable to the insidious spread. AIDS is an expensive disease, expensive to prevent and expensive to treat. With a limited budget more money for prevention means less for treatment. On the other hand without the promise of treatment no one has the incentive to be tested and without tests the disease will spread. . Then it will be apparent that AIDS is an expensive disease to neglect. UN experts have indicated that in the Asian region including India, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines and last of all Bangladesh, a disaster is waiting to happen. There are 5 million new cases every year, of which 58 per cent are people under 25. About 10 million Asians have either HIV or full blown AIDS, including about 8 million in India which is a grim warning to Bangladesh. Till recently many people in our country considered AIDS a scourge of the libertine West that posed little threat to a conservative society like ours based on monogamous marriages. But Bangladesh has also hundreds of thousands of sailors, labourers of all varieties and other professional groups who work abroad for a time and a continual tide of businessmen and trafficked women beyond the borders of this country. Villages in Bangladesh, to say nothing of the cities and towns, are not, in fact, the bastions of sexual probity they are quaintly imagined to be. Studies have shown that Bangladesh society, long considered so conservative, is more footloose and sexually free than is commonly admitted. The incidence of HIV virus in an epidemic form in a concentrated zone in Dhaka city should serve as a wake up call for the government in power and the one that would be coming to power through a credible election.

Asadullah Khan is a former teacher of physics and Controller of Examinations, BUET.",{},"['infection', 'high', 'india', 'hivaids', 'country', 'bay', 'report', 'hiv', 'disease', 'city', 'aids', 'bangladesh', 'scourge', 'hold']","The situation is set to change with a new World Bank report that brings the threat of AIDS closer to home.

Govt to set up 20 centres for free services,,,2014-05-04,The Daily Star,"The government for the first time ever will set up 20 health care facilities that will diagnose people for HIV/AIDS and provide treatment for the HIV positive patients for free, said a health ministry official at a discussion yesterday. “Of the 20 facilities, five will provide both treatment and diagnosis services, while the rest will only diagnose people,” said Dr Hossain Sarwar Khan, line director of National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP) of the health ministry, at the discussion held at The Daily Star Centre in the capital. The five facilities, named Care Support Treatment Centres, will be located at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and Infectious Diseases Hospital in Dhaka, Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Sylhet Medical College Hospital and Khulna Medical College Hospital. The fifteen other centres will be set up across the rest of the country, said Dr Khan. The NASP will set up the centres within a month or two with financial assistance from the World Bank, he said, adding that the centres would be set up at a time when 40 out of the 83 HIV testing centres run by NGOs with foreign funds would stop operating. CARE Bangladesh and The Daily Star jointly organised the discussion on “Cross border Mobility and HIV Vulnerability”. Medical and public health experts said although HIV is not prevalent among Bangladeshis, with less than 0.1 percent of people being infected with the virus, there is no place for complacency. Abu Taher, team leader of a CARE project, Enhancing Mobile Populations Access to HIV&AIDS Services, Information and Support, said at least 1.8 percent of the 2,184 people in Satkhira and Jessore having a track record of trans-border movement in India were found to be HIV positive. Citing 2012 data of International Organisation for Migration (IOM), he said among the reported HIV-positive people 60 percent were migrants. Health Secretary MM Neazuddin termed these statistics alarming, and suggested launching immediate campaign for behavioural change of vulnerable population. Shakirul Islam, a labour migration expert, said migrants left the country without any HIV orientation, but if they were diagnosed as HIV positive abroad they were deported immediately. He further said even when they returned home, they were not tested due to an absence of a referral system.

HIV goal to treat 15m met,"The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency.",,2015-07-14,The Daily Star,"The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency. The landmark figure was reached in March - nine months ahead of schedule. It follows decades of global efforts and investment to get antiretroviral drugs to those in need - such as people living in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000, when the UN first set goals to combat HIV, fewer than 700,000 people were receiving these vital medicines. According to UN Aids, which has a report out today, the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new HIV infections and nearly eight million Aids-related deaths since the millennium. Over the same time frame, new HIV infections have fallen from 2.6 million per year to 1.8 million, and Aids-related deaths have gone down from 1.6 million to 1.2 million. Meanwhile, global investment in HIV has gone up from £3.1bn ($4.8bn) in 2000 to more than £13bn ($20bn) in 2014. And concerted action over the next five years could end the Aids epidemic by 2030, says UN Aids. But progress has been slower in some areas. ENDING AIDS A major gap seems to be in awareness of HIV status, which is the biggest barrier to treatment access, says the report. And treatment access for children has lagged behind adults - although this is now improving. The proportion of children living with HIV who receive antiretroviral therapy almost doubled between 2010 and 2014 (from 14% to 32%), but coverage ""remains notably lower than it does for adults"", says the report. Even though new HIV infections have gone down, there is still an unacceptable number of new HIV infections each year, contributing to the burden of the epidemic. In 2014, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of all new HIV infections. And at the last headcount, there were an estimated 25.8 million people in this region living with HIV. The estimated count for the whole world was 36.9 million. This year sees the switch from Millennium Development Goals to broader Sustainable Development Goals. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations said: ""The world has delivered on halting and reversing the Aids epidemic. ""Now we must commit to ending the Aids epidemic as part of the Sustainable Development Goals."" The report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to ""sprint"" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030.",{},"['met', 'million', 'treat', 'hiv', 'investment', 'living', 'goal', '15m', 'aids', 'gone', 'infections', 'treatment', 'global', 'epidemic']","The goal to get HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has already been met, says the United Nations Aids agency.

Mainstream HIV issue for effective prevention,,,2008-12-05,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a roundtable yesterday underscored the need for mainstreaming the HIV/AIDS issue to help raise awareness and provide cost-effective service. The roundtable titled Mainstreaming of HIV: Role of leadership in Bangladesh was organised jointly by the UNFPA and The Daily Star at its conference room in the city. The speakers said mainstreaming of HIV would also help in removing stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), utilising service delivery and ensuring human and reproductive rights. While delivering the keynote paper Khandaker Ezazul Hoque, HIV officer of UNFPA Bangladesh, said mainstreaming is a process that enables development actors to address the cause and effect of HIV/AIDS. In his welcome speech, Pornchai Suchitta, deputy representative of UNFPA Bangladesh, said multi-sectoral response is important for effective prevention of HIV. “People of this country are now more pro-active and willing to talk about HIV and AIDS. What we need now is to harmonize our efforts for meaningful result,” he said, adding that big population in the country is a big challenge to keep the prevalence of HIV low and more advocacy is needed in this regard. Highlighting the governments initiatives in combating HIV/AIDS, Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad, additional secretary to health and family welfare ministry, said, “AIDS is not only a burden for health but also a burden for development as it affects our productivity and household income.” It is a threat for the country and the nation, he added. It is time to review the National HIV/AIDS Policy which was formulated in 1997 as by this time situation has changed much, said Dr Mozammel Haque of UNODC. He said policy makers should think of allocating budget from revenue sector in future rather than depending on just donor agencies to work on HIV/AIDS. The speakers said the programmes on IDUs and high risk groups and PLWHA should not be stopped for a single day while the issue of HIV/AIDS should be incorporated in the curriculum of non formal education also as it is introduced in formal education system. Expressing optimism focusing the activities of the government and non-government organisations on this issue they said Bangladesh is in right track to achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) that targets the halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. The speakers also recommended focusing on motivation about HIV/AIDS prevention, conducting more researches on AIDS related issues, access to government level data relating to AIDS/HIV should be easy for people, talking to the youth and other vulnerable groups before adopting any policy and strategy, increasing budget for AIDS prevention programme, conducting continuous monitoring and evaluation of AIDS prevention programme.

AIDS patients deprived of proper care,,,2008-04-18,The Daily Star,"The number of people living with HIV/AIDS is increasing in the country but they are not getting proper treatment as the lone Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) is yet to provide antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for these patients since it is very expensive. The IDH is providing treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS patients since 1989. But the government-owned Essential Drugs Company does not produce ARV, and it is not supplied to the IDH due to its high price, hospital sources said. “A person living with HIV/AIDS needs antiretroviral worth Tk 6,000 to Tk 10,000 every month. But the hospital does not have any special funds for HIV/AIDS patients, and it is not possible for the hospital with its limited funds to spend the huge amount of money needed for them,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Selimuzzaman of the IDH. “We just provide them treatment for opportunistic infections that occur due to collapse of the immune system of HIV/AIDS patients although they need psychological and nutritional support, opportunistic infection management and antiretroviral therapy at a time,” he said. The IDH can provide around 50 percent of drugs required for AIDS patients, he added. Non-government organisations (NGOs) working with people having HIV/AIDS however reported that patients get only 20-30 percent drugs for opportunistic infections, and no ARV, at the IDH. “Worldwide there are 20 types of ARV for treatment of HIV/AIDS patients. But we can provide only four types of ARV to our patients with interrupted supply. And there are at least 100 registered patients who need ARV badly but we cannot provide it,” said Asma Parvin, programme manager of Ashar Alo Society (AAS). “Antiretroviral drugs should be included in the essential drugs list,” said Lazeena Muna, social mobilisation and partnerships adviser of UNAIDS. An ARV drug policy is needed immediately for uninterrupted flow of these drugs, she stressed. She pointed out that a draft ARV drug policy was crafted a few months ago with no further progress in this regard . The IDH does not have even the machine for counting CD 4 cells that determine immune status of a HIV/AIDS patient. Patients now have to go to the ICDDR,B for counting CD4 cells, spending Tk 2,500 each. The counting is essential to assess whether ARV is needed or not. If CD4 cells decrease to 200, it becomes urgent to treat such patients with ARV, experts said. Sources noted that HIV/AIDS patients also find it difficult to have treatment at the public hospitals due to stigma. Meanwhile, the National HIV and AIDS Communication Strategy 2005--2010 emphasised that all public hospitals should provide treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. The National Strategic Plan has set the goal of ensuring that any one infected with HIV /AIDS has access to comprehensive systems of care, support and treatment by the year 2010. Talking to The Daily Star, AAS authorities said that in December last year, an AIDS patient referred to the IDH was asked to go for surgery as he had developed gangrene due to arsenicosis. But it took three months for the patient to under surgery as no private clinics wanted to admit the patient. When contacted, Professor of Virology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) Mohammad Nazrul Islam said the government should launch an anti-stigma programme concerning HIV/AIDS at health care centres. And it should start from the centres near voluntary counselling and testing centres as the diagnosis process begins there (testing centres). Unless there are treatment support facilities near the counselling and testing centres, HIV/AIDS patients would be left in a more vulnerable position. There are around 1,200 reported HIV/AIDS cases in the country and about 7,500, unreported cases, official sources said. The Commission on AIDS in Asia in a report said, nearly five million people are living with HIV in Asia with 440, 000 people dying each year. An additional eight million people will be infected by 2020. The death toll can be kept to less than 300,000 in 2020, saving the lives of more than 200,000 people each year. Governments must establish and maintain systems that provide continuous and sustainable access to antiretroviral therapy for all who need it, by ensuring affordability, availability, accessibility and adherence, the commission said. AIDS begins with HIV infection. People infected with HIV may have no symptoms for 10 years or longer, but they can still transmit the infection to others during this symptom-free period. But, if the infection is not detected and treated, the immune system gradually weakens, and AIDS develops.",{},"['care', 'infection', 'proper', 'hivaids', 'provide', 'idh', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'deprived', 'aids', 'drugs', 'arv', 'patients']","The IDH can provide around 50 percent of drugs required for AIDS patients, he added. “Worldwide there are 20 types of ARV for treatment of HIV/AIDS patients.

HIV/AIDS and financial commitment: Thought of World AIDS Day,,,2008-11-29,The Daily Star,"Around 40 million people worldwide are HIV positive, 95% of them live in developing countries. In 2004, approximately five million people were newly infected with the virus. HIV/AIDS has killed more than 20 million people worldwide. 3.1 million people died of AIDS-related causes in 2004. The Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) was created in 2001 to provide major financial resources in the fight against three diseases. These diseases kill over 6 million people each year and the numbers are growing. As of mid-2007, the Global Fund Board approved more than US$ 7.7 billion for programmes in 136 countries. Together with the efforts of many implementing partners, Global Fund-supported programmes have already saved 1.8 million lives. Till mid 2008, the Global Fund committed US$ 11.3 billion in 136 countries to support aggressive interventions against all three diseases. The Global Fund announced its approval of nearly $3 billion in Round 8 funding to improve access to HIV treatment and prevention and help reduce deaths from TB and malaria by 50% by 2015. The Global Funds board approved 94 grants worth $2.75 billion over two years, representing the groups largest funding round to date (Global Fund release, 11/10). The decision was made in New Delhi, during the Global Fund Board Meeting. The Board decision was rendered particularly difficult because the unusually large average size of the proposals meant that there was not enough money to pay the full cost of the proposals recommended for approval by the Technical Review Panel (TRP). As of mid 2008, Global Fund supported programmes are estimated to have averted more than 2.5 million deaths by providing AIDS treatment (ARV) for 1.75 million people, anti-tuberculosis treatment (DOTS) for 3.9 million people, and by distributing 59 million insecticide-treated bed nets for the prevention of malaria worldwide. Round 8 funding support now brings the Global Fund’s overall portfolio to US$ 14.4 billion in 140 countries. “This is the highest amount of new financing approved by the Global Fund ever. These new resources will significantly help the world in achieving global targets such as universal access to AIDS treatment and prevention, and cutting the number of deaths from tuberculosis and malaria by half by 2015,” said Rajat Gupta, Chair of the Global Fund Board. He added that 38% of the resources will be used for HIV/AIDS programmes, 11% for TB programmes and 51% for malaria programmes. Around 90% of the approved grants will be distributed to low-income countries, 77% of which are in Africa and the Middle East. The remaining funds will be dispersed to countries in Asia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Pacific, the Caribbean and Latin America. Michel Kazatchkine, Executive Director of the Global Fund, said the ""increased demand"" for funding ""requires a renewed resource mobilisation effort."" He added that the Global Fund has a ""fantastic message to bring back to the rich nations of the world: programmes to fight these three diseases save lives, reduce disease burdens and strengthen health systems"" (Global Fund release, 11/10). There is abundant evidence that science-based HIV prevention is effective, especially when backed by high-level political leadership, a national AIDS programme, strong community involvement together with adequate funding. Components of successful prevention efforts include clear and accurate communication about HIV/AIDS and methods to prevent infection, HIV counselling and testing, and treatment. Gap analysis reveals that vast majority of people living with HIV/AIDS in the developing world do not have access to the treatment, as a result of limited health care infrastructures and the high cost of many medications.

Nutrition for HIV infection and AIDS,,,2011-12-01,The Daily Star,"Do we eat to live"" or ""live to eat""? The first statement is true for all of us and the second is also true sometimes when our enjoyment of food is more important to us than the sustenance. This is the case for normal humans being like us, but it is different for Persons Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Nutritional care is just as important as medical care for people with HIV infections. Nutritional care and medical care are interdependent, and if we ignore either of these the other will surely suffer. The infection itself disrupts the bodys capacity to make use of nutrition. The HIV virus most often causes three nutritional problems: * Diminished appetite; * Less efficient nutrient absorption; and * Changes in the metabolic way of utilising food. All of these lead to malnutrition, which is a major problem for PLWHA. The most severe symptom of malnutrition in people with HIV infection is weight loss, and it is essentially related to macronutrient (carbohydrate, protein and, fat) deficiencies, not micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) deficiencies. Macronutrients give us calories while micronutrients do not. So, PLWHA should manage their diet so that it meets their macronutrient needs and spend less time on how to meet their micronutrient needs. This should be the most important principle for PLWHA. General nutritional information is okay for most normal people but not appropriate for people with HIV infection. True to say, very few foods are bad for PLWHA. Sugar is alright and salt can be taken. Red meat, saturated fats, and dairy products are fine, and the infected person should be encouraged to consume these things in their daily diet. But one vital thing should be kept in mind, they should avoid foods that could be a contamination risk, especially raw fish, raw meat, raw eggs, unprocessed honey and foods that are more than two days old. Low-fat and low-cholesterol diet is not suitable for PLWHA. Based on positive nutrition pyramid experts suggest eating the foods listed below every day: * Consume twice the normal amount of conventional high class protein (meat, poultry, and fish) daily. This could be 100-120 grams for men, 80-100 grams for women. About 450 grams of meat, poultry, or fish contain about 110 grams of protein; * At least 2 servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables; * At least 2 servings of milk (2 glasses); and * Enough calories from carbohydrate and fat to keep the weight of the PLWHA stable. By following the positive nutrition pyramid, PLWHA receive the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). It is recommended that HIV infected persons should take multivitamin supplements, which provide the vitamins and minerals missing in the diet. Their diet should also contain a safe and recommended amount of trace elements like manganese, copper, chromium, and selenium. The following additional supplements are also recommended for the PLWHA: Vitamin C (500-1000mg), Vitamin E (10-40 IU) and beta carotene (6 mg). Overdosing of other nutrients is not necessary and may be harmful. Sometimes the medical issues take primacy over the nutrition-related aspects of health. This is wrong. Food and medicine should go hand in hand for the treatment of the HIV infected people.

"WB seeks ideas to fight HIV, AIDS stigma in South Asia",,,2007-11-28,The Daily Star,"World Bank (WB) with the United Nations and private sector partners launched in Washington on Monday a competitive Development Marketplace aimed at identifying and funding innovative approaches to reduce stigma and discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS in the South Asia region, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, says a WB press release. Titled Tackling HIV and AIDS Stigma and Discrimination: From Insights to Action, the Development Marketplace competition is reaching out to communities across South Asia seeking proposals for local, small-scale projects with the potential to be scaled up and replicated. The winners will be selected by an international jury of WB and independent HIV and AIDS experts at the Development Marketplace event in Mumbai, India on May 15, 2008. “Stigma and discrimination seriously undermines efforts to fight HIV and AIDS,” said Praful Patel, WB vice-president for South Asia region. “It also marginalises people at risk and living with the disease contributing further to their social isolation and rejection. This competition offers a unique opportunity to channel small grants directly to community organisations and NGOs to implement imaginative approaches that will help change the attitudes and practices that undermine effective programmes,” he added. In South Asia, anecdotal evidence and research are demonstrating the extent of the role of stigma in hampering prevention, treatment and care of HIV and AIDS. For instance, a study in India found that 34 percent of students, faculty, and technical staff of the public health services would not associate with people living with HIV and AIDS. The HIV epidemic in South Asia is mainly driven by high-risk practices such as sex work, injecting drug use and unprotected sex between men. ""Many of the people most at risk for HIV around the world deal with stigma on a regular basis, posing challenges to achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support,"" said UNAIDS Executive Director Dr Peter Piot. ""It is encouraging to see innovative steps being taken towards addressing these issues in South Asia, where stigma and discrimination remain serious problems,"" he said. The South Asia Regional Development Marketplace is implemented in partnership with UNAIDS, UNICEF, UNODC, UNDP, GFATM and with the private sector and it is open to all civil society groups, social entrepreneurs, youth organisations, private foundations, academia, and private sector corporations with unique ideas that may not attract funding from traditional sources of finance. The maximum award will be US$40,000 per proposal. Proposals will be accepted until January 21, 2008. The Development Marketplace is a WB programme that uses a competitive and transparent process to support grassroots initiatives with innovative approaches to solve challenging development issues. The programme has awarded nearly $34 million to roughly 800 small-scale projects over the last seven years.",{},"['discrimination', 'ideas', 'marketplace', 'seeks', 'asia', 'private', 'hiv', 'development', 'stigma', 'aids', 'fight', 'wb', 'south']","The winners will be selected by an international jury of WB and independent HIV and AIDS experts at the Development Marketplace event in Mumbai, India on May 15, 2008. “Stigma and discrimination seriously undermines efforts to fight HIV and AIDS,” said Praful Patel, WB vice-president for South Asia region.

First man functionally cured of HIV,,,2011-11-12,The Daily Star,"Since HIV was discovered 30 years ago, 30 million people have died from the disease, and it continues to spread at the rate of 7,000 people per day globally, according to the UN. Now, after years of progress in holding back the disease, there is finally an apparent case of one successful cure. 45-year-old Timothy Ray Brown tested positive for HIV back in 1995, but now has entered the scientific journals as the first man in world history to have his HIV completely eliminated from his body. It is what doctors call a ""functional cure."" He was living in Berlin, Germany, in 2007, dealing with HIV and leukemia, when scientists there gave him a bone marrow, stem cell transplant that had astounding results. ""The Berlin Patient,"" as Brown is known, received stem cells from a donor who was immune to HIV. In fact, about one percent of Caucasians are immune to HIV. Some say it goes back to the Great Plague; people who survived the plague developed an immunity, and that immunity was passed down to their heirs today. Brown is now being monitored by doctors at San Francisco General Hospital and doctors there sought out a medical opinion from one of the most respected AIDS researchers in the world, Dr. Jay Levy, who was one of the co-discoverers of the HIV virus. “Timothy Browns radical procedure may not be applicable to many other people with HIV, because of the difficulty in doing stem cell transplants, and finding the right donor. But this one case does open the door to the field of cure research, which is now gaining more attention”, experts opined.",{},"['man', 'doctors', 'donor', 'immune', 'hiv', 'disease', 'cell', 'world', 'cured', 'stem', 'plague', 'functionally', 'immunity']","45-year-old Timothy Ray Brown tested positive for HIV back in 1995, but now has entered the scientific journals as the first man in world history to have his HIV completely eliminated from his body.

CARE's HIV awareness campaign in Ctg,,,2003-01-11,The Daily Star,"The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS has resulted in a grave situation all over the world. According to WHOs most recent projection, South and South-East Asia will be the region most affected in the next few years, since the infection is spreading more rapidly here than other parts of the world. In a developing country like Bangladesh where there are poverty, discrimination, sexual inequality, inadequate health and social service, rapid urbanisation and a large migrant labour force, which is prone to environmental disasters and surrounded by growing regional HIV/ AIDS epidemic, a potentially serious development crisis will follow if the HIV epidemic is permitted to go unchecked. An international development organisation named CARE-Bangladesh has come forward with a HIV/AIDS prevention project called SHAKTI (Stopping HIV/ AIDS through Knowledge and Training Initiatives). The goal of the project is to increase adoption of sustainable safer behaviour among the high risk people in order to reduce transmission of HIV/AIDS. Its purpose is to implement and promote effective HIV/AIDS interventions to sustain safer behaviour among selected population, Sex Workers (SWs), Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), Transgender (Hijra), males who have sex with males, transport workers, HIV positive and others. The port city of Chittagong is a centre of a large migrant labour force. Hundreds of thousands of people work here as port workers, transport workers and ghat (terminal) workers. CARE-Bangladesh has identified these workers as a vulnerable population. This is because many of these workers often practice high-risk behaviours and therefore are at risk to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Generally, they do not seek examination or treatment for these diseases, and constitute a great risk of spreading HIV into the population at large. CARE-Bangladesh aims at restoring the dignity of the worker community, to help them understand HIV and how to protect themselves against it and to work with them to advance their own rights. The project aims to reach thousands of truck drivers, their helpers, dock-workers and ghat workers. With this aim in view CARE-Bangladesh has established some Drop-in-Centres (DICs) in Chittagong. These are considered to be safe places to take rest for sometime, seek referral services to Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and other ailments. DIC is the place where workers come to meet with their friends, to take rest, to play indoor games. This place is also used as a venue for group education session and a centre for management of STDs and other common diseases. There is a full-time physician in the DIC of the port area who regularly advises to the port workers. The DIC is situated in the dock workers union office. No rent is taken from the CARE authorities and the union leaders play an active role in combating the menace. HIV prevalence has been found to be nil among the port workers here. Another DIC provides free services to the needy people in the transport workers union office here. The programme is being conducted through partnership with the port and transport workers associations with an objective to make it more acceptable to the community members. Dock labour union and transport workers union are the implementing agencies. Trained peer Out Reach workers work on six days a week in the Majhi ghat area and the truck terminal area in the port city to educate other fellow workers about safer sex practices. They refer the STD patients to the clinic to have treatment and sell condom among the workers. They are mainly responsible to provide information to the workers and refer them to the clinic of the DIC. They also demonstrate the proper use of condom in the field. So far it has produced positive results, said Abul Kashem, general secretary (GS) of the Chattagram Jatyio Dock Sramik League. Hundreds of workers are being benefitted by this programme, he added.",{},"['transport', 'ctg', 'workers', 'union', 'work', 'hiv', 'dic', 'safer', 'port', 'awareness', 'diseases', 'campaign', 'sex', 'cares']","Hundreds of thousands of people work here as port workers, transport workers and ghat (terminal) workers.

He urged all concerned to follow the PCS (prevention, care and support) Formula and spread mass awareness campaign across the country. ""Because of high moral ethics, impact of religion and strong social and family bond, we are fortunate enough that the number of HIV/Aids patients here still is less than apprehension, although the contributing factors to the fatal disease have relatively been very high in Bangladesh,"" said Principal Wahab Chowdhury. Prof Serajul in his paper said the recent introduction of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has reduced HIV/Aids morbidity and mortality by 60 to 90 percent and improved the quality and duration of life of the patients concerned. ""But the high cost of the therapy is the major constraint in the treatment of HIV/Aids patient in Bangladesh,"" he said, adding that only 13 lakh people around the world are currently receiving ART while a total of 70 lakh are estimated to require the therapy right now. Prof Serajul recommended that ARV (anti-retroviral) drugs should be included in the essential drug list and be provided free of cost to each and every one who requires it.

HIV pandemic's roots traced back to 1920s Kinshasa,,,2014-10-03,The Daily Star,"About 2880 candles are seen lit during a World AIDS Day event in Jakarta December 1, 2009. Photo: Reuters The origin of the Aids pandemic has been traced to the 1920s in the city of Kinshasa, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, scientists say. An international team of scientists say a ""perfect storm"" of population growth, sex and railways allowed HIV to spread. A feat of viral archaeology was used to find the pandemics origin, the team report in the journal Science. They used archived samples of HIVs genetic code to trace its source, with evidence pointing to 1920s Kinshasa. Their report says a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics probably spread the virus. Meanwhile Belgium-backed railways had one million people flowing through the city each year, taking the virus to neighbouring regions. Experts said it was a fascinating insight into the start of the pandemic. HIV came to global attention in the 1980s and has infected nearly 75 million people. It has a much longer history in Africa, but where the pandemic started has remained the source of considerable debate. FAMILY AFFAIR A team at the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, tried to reconstruct HIVs ""family tree"" and find out where its oldest ancestors came from. The research group analysed mutations in HIVs genetic code. ""You can see the footprints of history in todays genomes, it has left a record, a mutation mark in the HIV genome that cant be eradicated,"" Prof Oliver Pybus from the University of Oxford told the BBC. By reading those mutational marks, the research team rebuilt the family tree and traced its roots. HIV is a mutated version of a chimpanzee virus, known as simian immunodeficiency virus, which probably made the species-jump through contact with infected blood while handling bush meat. The virus made the jump on multiple occasions. One event led to HIV-1 subgroup O which affects tens of thousands in Cameroon. Yet only once, HIV-1 subgroup M, went on to infect millions of people across every country in the world. The answer to why this happened lies in the era of black and white film and the tail-end of the European empires. In the 1920s, Kinshasa (called Leopoldville until 1966) was part of the Belgian Congo. Prof Oliver Pybus said: ""It was a very large and very rapidly growing area and colonial medical records show there was a high incidence of various sexually transmitted diseases."" Sex and railways Large numbers of male labourers were drawn to the city, distorting the gender balance until men outnumbered women two to one, eventually leading to a roaring sex trade. Prof Pybus added: ""There are two aspects of infrastructure that could have helped public health campaigns to treat people for various infectious diseases, with injections seem a plausible route [for spreading the virus]. ""The second really interesting aspect is the transport networks that enabled people to move round a huge country."" Around one million people were using Kinshasas railways by the end of the 1940s. The virus spread, with neighbouring Brazzaville and the mining province, Katanga, rapidly hit. Those ""perfect storm"" conditions lasted just a few decades in Kinshasa, but by the time they ended the virus was already starting to spread around the world. Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: ""Its a fascinating insight into the early phases of the HIV-1 pandemic. ""Its the usual suspects that are most likely to have helped the virus get a foothold in humans - travel, population increases and human practices such as unsafe healthcare interventions and prostitution. ""Perhaps the most contentious suggestion is that the spread of the M-group viruses had more to do with the conditions being right than it had to do with these viruses being better adapted for transmission and growth in humans. Im sure this suggestion will prompt interesting and lively debate within the field."" Dr Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said: ""It does seem an interesting study demonstrating very elegantly how HIV spread in the Congo region long before the Aids epidemic was recognised in the early 80s. ""It was already known that HIV in humans arose by cross species transmission from chimpanzees in that region of Africa, but this study maps in great detail the spread of the virus from Kinshasa, it was fascinating to read.""",{},"['virus', 'pandemics', 'spread', 'pybus', 'university', '1920s', 'used', 'railways', 'roots', 'team', 'hiv', 'traced', 'sex', 'kinshasa']","Photo: ReutersThe origin of the Aids pandemic has been traced to the 1920s in the city of Kinshasa, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, scientists say.

New guidance on HIV self-testing,The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released new guidelines on HIV self-testing to improve access to and uptake of HIV diagnosis.,,2016-12-04,The Daily Star,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released new guidelines on HIV self-testing to improve access to and uptake of HIV diagnosis. According to a new WHO progress report lack of an HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to implementing the Organisation’s recommendation that everyone with HIV should be offered antiretroviral therapy (ART). The report reveals that more than 18 million people with HIV are currently taking ART, and a similar number is still unable to access treatment, the majority of which are unaware of their HIV positive status. Today, 40% of all people with HIV (over 14 million) remain unaware of their status. Many of these are people at higher risk of HIV infection who often find it difficult to access existing testing services. HIV self-testing means people can use oral fluid or blood- finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results are ready within 20 minutes or less. Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services. HIV self-testing is a way to reach more people with undiagnosed HIV and represents a step forward to empower individuals, diagnose people earlier before they become sick, bring services closer to where people live, and create demand for HIV testing. This is particularly important for those people facing barriers to accessing existing services. HIV testing coverage remains low among various population groups. For example, global coverage rates for all HIV testing, prevention, and treatment are lower among men than women. Men account for only 30% of people who have tested for HIV. As a result, men with HIV are less likely to be diagnosed and put on antiretroviral treatment and are more likely to die of HIV-related causes than women. But some women miss out too. Adolescent girls and young women in East and Southern Africa experience infection rates up to eight times higher than among their male peers. Fewer than one in every five girls (15–19 years of age) are aware of their HIV status. Testing also remains low among ""key populations"" and their partners - particularly men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and people in prisons - who comprise approximately 44% of the 1.9 million new adult HIV infections that occur each year. Up to 70 % of partners of people with HIV are also HIV positive. Many of those partners are not currently getting tested. The new WHO guidelines recommend ways to help HIV positive people notify their partners about their status, and also encourage them to get tested. Self-testing has been shown to nearly double the frequency of HIV testing among men who have sex with men, and recent studies in Kenya found that male partners of pregnant women had twice the uptake of HIV testing when offered self-testing compared with standard testing. Twenty three countries currently have national policies that support HIV self-testing. Many other countries are developing policies, but wide-scale implementation of HIV self-testing remains limited. WHO supports free distribution of HIV self-test kits and other approaches that allow self-test kits to be bought at affordable prices. WHO is also working to reduce costs further to increase access. The new guidance aims to help countries scale up implementation.",{},"['women', 'positive', 'status', 'men', 'testing', 'hiv', 'partners', 'access', 'guidance', 'treatment', 'selftesting']","The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released new guidelines on HIV self-testing to improve access to and uptake of HIV diagnosis.

Children with HIV in Asia resistant to AIDS drugs!,,,2011-12-03,The Daily Star,"Teenagers in Asia receiving treatment for HIV are showing early signs of osteoporosis and children as young as five are becoming resistant to AIDS drugs, an anti-AIDS group said recently, urging more attention be given to young HIV patients. The finding is a reminder that while more people in Asia now have access to basic AIDS drugs, improved medicines remain out of reach and patients — both adults and children — still suffer from inadequate care. In Asia, some 160,000 children are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. Of these, 57,000 require treatment but only 30,000 were receiving it as of the end of 2008, according to Unicef. Researchers at TREAT Asia found children as young as five were developing resistance to AIDS drugs and may soon require improved, more expensive medicines, which are not available for them yet. Poor adherence to the timing or frequency of taking AIDS drugs can result in resistance. But in Asia, resistance is also due to the lack of drug formulations for children. Annette Sohn, Director of TREAT Asia said health experts and drug providers need to find ways to make third-line, more powerful drugs available for children in poor countries. Such medications are available or subsidised in rich nations but very expensive and sometimes unavailable in developing countries. ""We all made some mistakes on how we managed patients with HIV in the beginning of the epidemic,"" Sohn said. ""We used adult tablets. We had no pediatric formulations in our countries."" ""Unless we develop access to third-line drugs, we are going to find ourselves in a clinic room with a patient that there is nothing left and we have no other drug to give them."" A long-term study of 4,000 HIV patients under the age of 23 in Asia by TREAT Asia also showed that a high percentage of teenagers had low bone mineral density, a precursor of osteoporosis. ""We did a special X-ray on these teenagers who are about 16 years old and found that 15 percent of them had low bone mass,"" Sohn said. ""That is not normal. Kids are not supposed to have low bone mass when theyre 16 years old and thats because of the effect of HIV on their bodies ... brain, bone, immune system."" Sohn, a paediatric specialist for children with HIV/AIDS, said this may also be due to toxic effects that some AIDS drugs, such as tenofovir, have on bones. The study covers Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and India. TREAT Asia is a network of clinics, hospitals and research institutions working together to improve treatment access.",{},"['young', 'teenagers', 'resistant', 'asia', 'treat', 'hiv', 'children', 'aids', 'bone', 'drugs', 'treatment']","Teenagers in Asia receiving treatment for HIV are showing early signs of osteoporosis and children as young as five are becoming resistant to AIDS drugs, an anti-AIDS group said recently, urging more attention be given to young HIV patients.

'New HIV strain leapt to humans from gorillas',,,2009-08-02,The Daily Star,"French virologists yesterday said they had found a new subtype of the AIDS virus that appears to have jumped the species barrier to humans from gorillas. The new strain, found in a woman from Cameroon, West Africa, is part of the HIV-1 family of microbes that account for the vast majority of cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they said. Until now, all have been linked to the chimpanzee. The new subtype has been called P, adding to three established HIV-1 subtypes -- M, by far the most prevalent, and O and N, which are rare. There is also an HIV-2, which is a minority viral family and is also suspected to have origins in non-human primates. The virus was sequenced from a blood sample taken from an unnamed 62-year-old woman who moved to Paris from Cameroon, according to a letter published by the journal Nature Medicine. In 2004, shortly after moving to the French capital, the woman was tested for HIV. She responded to diagnostic tests for HIV-1 but further tests failed to pinpoint the viral subtype. The virus was genetically decoded and then put through a computer model to compare its evolutionary past against known viruses, both HIV and its equivalent in apes, called simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The strain was a ""significant"" match with SIVgor -- an immune deficiency virus found in gorillas. ""The most likely explanation for its emergence is gorilla-to-human transmission of SIVgor,"" the letter says. The research was headed by Jean-Christophe Plantier at a national referencing laboratory for HIV at the Rouen Hospital Centre, northwestern France. HIV is believed to have jumped from humans from their closest animal relatives more than a century ago, in west-central Africa. Analysis of tissues preserved by doctors in the colonial-era Belgian Congo shows that HIV-1 began spreading among humans at some point between 1884 and 1924, according to an investigation published last October. But until now, the known vector has been the chimpanzee. Some experts have suspected that the gorilla may have been implicated in the N subtype, but this is the first time that a link has been so clearly defined. ""A gorilla origin is highly likely"" in the new P subtype, Marie Leoz, one of the research team, told AFP. ""For the time being, its the closest source. What is still quite difficult, though, is to date when the first transmission of the virus took place, because there are still very few gorilla strains that are available."" Leoz also said subtype P was probably rare among humans, but further work was needed to confirm this. The Cameroonian woman has no sign of AIDS, is receiving treatment and has a stable count of viruses and of CD4 cells, a key benchmark of immune-system fitness, said Leoz. There are several theories that seek to explain how SIV entered humans. An infected animal bit a human, or a SIV-infected ape was butchered and sold for bushmeat, and the virus entered the bloodstream through tiny cuts in the hand, according to these hypotheses. AIDS first came to public notice in 1981, when alert US doctors noted an unusual cluster of deaths among young homosexuals in California and New York. It has since killed at least 25 million people, and 33 million others are living with the disease or HIV, the virus that destroys immune cells and exposes the body to opportunistic disease.",{},"['virus', 'woman', 'strain', 'hiv1', 'gorilla', 'viruses', 'according', 'subtype', 'leapt', 'humans', 'hiv', 'p', 'gorillas']","French virologists yesterday said they had found a new subtype of the AIDS virus that appears to have jumped the species barrier to humans from gorillas.

“Utsho”: Tele-film to generate awareness on HIV/AIDS,,,2007-11-30,The Daily Star,"The premier show of tele-film Utsho was held at the Central Public Library auditorium recently. The film is an initiative to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS and the screening was sponsored by UNAIDS in collaboration with Grameenphone. UNAIDS mission is to lead, strengthen and support an extended response to HIV and AIDS that includes preventing transmission of HIV, providing care and support to those already living with the virus, reducing the vulnerability of individuals and communities to HIV and alleviating the impact of the epidemic. The tele-film is directed by Tony Michael, and is his first work. Intekhab Dinar, Richi Solaiman and Tazin Ahmed have played the central roles. The film follows Anis (Intekhab Dinar) who donates blood for his friend but the doctors refrain from injecting the blood to the patient as HIV is detected in Anis blood. To reconfirm Anis goes to a doctor (Tazin Ahmed) and gets another blood test. When his wife, Mili (Richi), finds out that Anis is HIV positive, she leave him, thinking that he must have cheated on her by having illicit relationships with other women. This devastates Anis, as now he has no one to provide moral support. He tries to trace the source of the disease but fails. At one point he recalls that while he was a student of university, someone once gave him blood to save his life. Anis is convinced that the donor must have been HIV positive. Meanwhile Mili is also tested HIV positive. In the end the two decide to support each other. The film tries to generate awareness on transmission of HIV through unsafe blood transfusion. The film also focuses on the importance of the support and care an individual living with HIV/AIDS needs. Talking about the film, Tony says, “Documentaries, films and TV plays can play a major role in generating awareness and that has been the key message in my film.” “With no known cure yet, awareness is the only effective means to fight HIV/AIDS,” he adds. AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). With each day more and more people around the globe are getting infected by this deadly disease. An estimated 33.2 million people are now living with AIDS worldwide. Advisor to the Ministries of Health and Family Welfare, Water Resources and Religious Affairs, Major General (Retd) Dr. ASM Matiur Rahman was the chief guest at the launch of the film. Dan Odallo, UNAIDS Country Coordinator; Arthur Erken, representative, UNFPA; Bibi Russell and others were present at the occasion.",{},"['utsho', 'film', 'support', 'anis', 'virus', 'positive', 'hivaids', 'generate', 'hiv', 'living', 'telefilm', 'blood', 'awareness']",The film is an initiative to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS and the screening was sponsored by UNAIDS in collaboration with Grameenphone.

Men at higher risk of dying of AIDS than women: UNAIDS,"Men are less likely to test for HIV or access antiretroviral therapy and, therefore, are more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses than women, UNAIDS says.",,2017-12-04,The Daily Star,"Men are less likely to test for HIV or access antiretroviral therapy and, therefore, are more likely to die of AIDS-related illnesses than women, UNAIDS said on Friday. Around the world, fewer than half of HIV-positive men are getting treatment, compared to 60 percent of women, according to a UNAIDS report released on World AIDS Day. Men are also more likely than women to start treatment late, interrupt it, and not follow up after treatment. About 36.7 million people in the world were living with HIV in 2016, but fewer than 21 million people had access to antiretrovirals, according to UNAIDS. AIDS or related diseases killed one million people worldwide in 2016 and an estimated 1.8 million new infections were reported. In sub-Saharan Africa, men living with HIV are 20 percent less likely to know their HIV status than women. In the same region, condom use for one-night stands is low among older men, who are also more likely to be HIV-positive. ""These data are consistent with studies showing a cycle of HIV transmission from older men to younger women, and from adult women to adult men of a similar age in places with high HIV prevalence,"" said UNAIDS. Gay men are 24 times more likely to contract HIV than heterosexual men. In addition, in more than a dozen countries, including Mexico and Nigeria, more than 15 percent of gay men live with AIDS.

Drugs add 13 years to average life of HIV patient,,,2008-08-02,The Daily Star,"Cocktails of HIV drugs help patients live an average of 13 years longer — if they are lucky enough to get them, researchers reported. A person who started taking the drugs at age 20 could, on average, expect to live another 43 years, the researchers report in the Lancet medical journal. They looked at several studies of patients living in the United States, Canada and several European countries who received drug combinations known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART. Robert Hogg of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in Vancouver, Canada and colleagues looked at 43,000 patients in 14 different studies. ""Between 1996-99 and 2003-05, there was a gain in life expectancy for those at age 20 years of about 13 years; similar gains in life expectancy in those aged 35 years were also seen,"" they wrote. ""A person starting combination therapy can expect to live about 43 years at 20 years of age, about two-thirds as long as the general population in these countries."" Average life expectancy for a 20-year-old without HIV in those countries would be 80, they said. Patients treated later on in their infections and those infected via injected drug use did not live as long as those treated early, the researchers found. Near-normal life There is no vaccine and no cure but the drugs can suppress the virus and allow patients to lead a near-normal life. Without treatment, the virus destroys the immune system, leaving patients susceptible to infections and cancer. More than 20 drugs are now on the market and can be combined in various ways to control the virus, although it usually mutates eventually and patients must switch to different regimens to keep it under control. Drug companies have come up with combination pills to make it easier to stay on therapy. Nearly 3 million people in the developing world now get HIV drugs — about 70 percent of those who need them, according to the United Nations. Makers include GlaxoSmithKline, which helped pay for the Lancet study, Gilead Sciences Inc, Roche, Pfizer, Merck Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Abbott Laboratories. HIV is passed through sex, blood, injected drug use and from mother to child at birth or through breast milk. In a second study in Lancet, Robert Bollinger of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and an international team of colleagues found that giving the HIV drug nevirapine daily to breastfed infants up to six weeks of age could protect them. A study of nearly 1,900 infants showed that giving them the drug for weeks, instead of simply dosing the mother while in labor and the baby shortly after birth, reduced infection rates by 46 percent. Doctors believe the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks in poor countries where it is difficult to obtain clean water or infant formula. ""Extended infant prophylaxis with nevirapine is simple enough to be implemented almost anywhere,"" Dr. Jeffrey Stringer and Dr. Benjamin Chi of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, wrote in a commentary. ""It represents a long-awaited, if partial, solution to a mothers impossible choice.

HIV 'can stop within a generation',,,2013-04-24,The Daily Star,"The campaign will run for two years. This photo has been taken from BBC. The spread of HIV in England can be stopped within a generation, according to a new prevention campaign launched by the Department of Health. Currently, there are around 90,000 people living with HIV in England. Only one person in four knows they have it. Gay and bisexual men and people in African communities make up three-quarters of cases. Focused screening and prevention in high-risk groups could end the epidemic, experts say. The new It Starts With Me campaign, created by the Terrence Higgins Trust, urges people in high-risk groups to get tested for HIV at least every 12 months, and more frequently if they have symptoms or have put themselves at risk by having unprotected sex, for example. Effective treatment Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive at the trust, said: ""While a cure or vaccine for HIV remains stubbornly out of reach, what many people dont realise is that medical advances mean it is now within our grasp to stop the virus in its tracks.

World AIDS Day,"Notorious for being known as one of the gravest pandemics, AIDS (Acquired Immuno-deficiency Syndrome) is a destructive disease that attacks the body's immune system and is caused by HIV, the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus.",,2017-11-28,The Daily Star,"Notorious for being known as one of the gravest pandemics, AIDS (Acquired Immuno-deficiency Syndrome) is a destructive disease that attacks the bodys immune system and is caused by HIV, the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus. Globally symbolised by a red ribbon, AIDS plagues over 36 million people worldwide. However, only 1% of those annual cases are recorded in Bangladesh. World AIDS Day is marked on December 1 every year to raise awareness and unite in the fight against HIV and AIDS. The theme this year is -- Increasing Impact through Transparency, Accountability and Partnerships -- and various support groups, HIV/AIDS Prevention Projects and many educational programmes have been jointly organised by the Bangladeshi government, UNICEF and the World Bank. These aim to offer solidarity with HIV victims and present AIDS as a critical but treatable disease, instead of a hushed taboo. But hushing taboos isnt an overnight task. The first step of the movement is communication. Misinformation and misconception team up to power negative feelings and prejudice against HIV victims. Fear of expulsion from society, being deemed morally irresponsible and judgmental links to drug abuse and promiscuity -- the stigma enveloping HIV is overwhelming. Its no surprise that thousands choose silence and look the other way when its important to remember to simply begin by talking about it. However, plain talking is only half the battle. Trudge along with slow, baby steps to a more educated nation and debunk unsupported myths. HIV may very well be a viral disease but it is not contagious through physical contact such as hugs and hand-shakes, sharing food/utensils or even via air and water, for e.g. from coughs or swimming pools. Only through the contact of bodily fluids such as blood and unsterilized needles do you actually run a risk of infection. But infections can be prevented; even treated. Doctors orders are safe practices and good hygiene, along with getting tested every 3 months. You can also opt for an HIV combo test which can detect the virus in its early stages. If you think you have been at risk of HIV, go for PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), a medication aimed to prevent HIV in advance whereas infected blood in your body can be counteracted with PEP (Post Exposure Prophylaxis). Moreover, Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) has proven to be a groundbreaking HIV treatment. Still, the fact that the disease is ultimately incurable remains. However, HIV is not a death sentence. It is just an infection after all. It has no cure but timely medications can keep it in check, while even boosting a healthy immune system. With the proper consultations from physicians, an HIV-positive patient can even prevent the eventual diagnosis of AIDS. The battle against HIV/AIDS is almost at the finish line. Bring it home by standing tall as a community, unanimous in support, acceptance and elimination of transmission. Only then can we champion ourselves for an AIDS-free generation.",{},"['support', 'day', 'virus', 'system', 'disease', 'hiv', 'victims', 'talking', 'world', 'prophylaxis', 'aids', 'risk']","Globally symbolised by a red ribbon, AIDS plagues over 36 million people worldwide.

Blocking HIV for Monkeys,An international research team has developed an effective treatment strategy against the HIV-like Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques.,,2016-10-21,The Daily Star,"An international research team has developed an effective treatment strategy against the HIV-like Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques. According to the WHO, around 36 million people are infected with HIV and a cure for the deadly virus infection has not yet been found. An international research team that includes scientists from the German Primate Center (DPZ), Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in Göttingen, has developed a new treatment strategy against the HIV-related Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). SI viruses infect different primate species and are regarded as the origin of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In the study, SIV-infected rhesus macaques were treated with an antiretroviral drug for 90 days and in addition they were treated with a specific antibody for 23 weeks. After finishing this therapy, all macaques showed sustained control of the infection as almost no SI viruses could be detected in the blood and gastro-intestinal tissues. The CD4+ T cells that are essential for the immune system were present in sufficient numbers in these tissues. Two years after finishing the treatment the viral load remained low, the immune system intact, and the rhesus macaques healthy. The treatment strategy thus offers a new and promising approach to the therapy of HIV infections in humans (Science).",{},"['virus', 'macaques', 'viruses', 'immunodeficiency', 'strategy', 'blocking', 'hiv', 'primate', 'treated', 'rhesus', 'monkeys', 'research', 'treatment']","An international research team has developed an effective treatment strategy against the HIV-like Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques.

The treatment strategy thus offers a new and promising approach to the therapy of HIV infections in humans (Science).",https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/quirky-science/blocking-hiv-monkeys-1301623
Public hospitals turn their backs on AIDS patients,,,2011-11-23,The Daily Star,"The government must without delay ensure that HIV positive patients get treatment and care without any discrimination at the public medical facilities, speakers urged at a roundtable yesterday. The roundtable, with the theme being ""Role of local administration and health authorities in HIV/AIDS prevention"", was organised by Prothom Alo Trust in association with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The speakers mentioned several instances where Aids patients were denied emergency treatment. ""We all know that the disease cannot spread through touch, yet we deny treating people suffering from Aids out of fear,"" said Dr Halida Hanum Khandaker, executive director of Confidential Approach to Aids Prevention. Dr Halida complained that, if the identity of an HIV positive patient was disclosed, the public hospitals usually preferred not to treat them. Citing an incident this year, she mentioned that she had to run from hospital to hospital with an HIV positive pregnant woman for delivery. Finally, she managed to admit the woman to a government hospital through concealing the fact that the woman was suffering from AIDS. Prof Dr Nazrul Islam of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) noted that Aids patients were even denied casual treatment in the public hospitals. ""Doctors have to decide whether they want to get affected with HIV by treating the Aids patients unobserved or accept such patients for treatment by taking the necessary precautions,"" he said. The participants called for initiatives to motivate public servants on the matter. Abdul Basit, civil surgeon of Tangail, called for identifying the different government and non-government organisations with a view to ensuring coordination between them. Moderated by Prothom Alo Joint Editor Abdul Quayum, the roundtable was also attended by Additional Secretary of health and family planning ministry AKM Amir Hossain, Joint Secretary of parliament secretariat ASM Mahbubul Alam, UNFPA Assistant Representative Hasina Begum and National HIV/Aids line Director Dr Abdul Wahid.

Stop needle sharing to halt spread of HIV,,,2009-10-07,The Daily Star,"Besides Dhaka, the HIV positive people among the injecting drug users (IDUs) have been found in six districts, but the intervention is limited to capital only, said the experts at a national workshop yesterday. The two-day workshop titled Injecting Drug Users and Harm Reduction has been organised by National AIDS/ STD Programme (NASP) in association with the USAID and Family Health International (FHI) at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in the city. The speakers said there are HIV positive people among the IDUs in Khulna, Ishwardi, Chapainawabganj, Narayanganj and Chandpur, but intervention has been stopped in those areas since the beginning of the year. The IDUs are more prone to spread infection among others as the study has found that 90 percent of them share needles. So, if the IDUs are not addressed properly, the infection would spread rapidly, the experts cautioned. At some points of the capital the HIV has already turned into concentrated epidemic, they said, adding that HIV incidence among the IDUs in Dhaka jumped from 1.4 percent in 2001 to 7 percent in 2007, which is 11 percent in some points now. They also highlighted lack of coordination, evaluation and monitoring in the programmes. Interventions and challenges of the programmes were also discussed at the workshop. Some 15.9 million people inject drugs worldwide and in South and South-East Asia it is 3.3 million. One in 10 HIV infections globally are directly linked to injection drug use while in Asia it increases to one in three, experts said. Speaking as chief guest at the inaugural session of the programme Health Minister Prof AFM Ruhal Haque stressed the need for strengthening comprehensive harm reduction programme. ""It might be disastrous if needle sharing could not be stopped,"" he said, adding that there are 46 lakh drug users in the country and of them 40 percent are young people. Some 40,000 people are IDUs in the country of which 5,000 are in the capital, he added. Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Prof Shah Monir Hossain admitted that the advancement in HIV/AIDS prevention programmes did not take place as it was expected. While talking to the press Additional Director General of the narcotic control department Yousuf Ali said they lack adequate logistics to check narcotic crimes in the country.

2 million children living with HIV: UN report,,,2008-04-05,The Daily Star,"More than two million children worldwide were living with the HIV virus in 2007, most of whom were infected before they were born, a joint study by United Nations humanitarian organisations said Thursday. Some 290,000 children under the age of 15 died of AIDS last year and 12.1 million children in sub-Saharan Africa lost one or both parents to the disease, according to the ""Children and AIDS"" report by the World Health Organisation, Unicef and UNAIDS. ""Todays children and young people have never known a world free of AIDS,"" said Unicef executive director Ann Veneman. ""Children must be at the heart of the global AIDS agenda,"" she urged. The report highlighted four areas crucial to tackling the epidemic: preventing HIV transmission from mothers to children; providing paediatric treatment; preventing infection among adolescents and young people; and protecting and supporting children affected by AIDS. While some progress has been made in all these areas, the report found that significant challenges remain. For example, 21 countries including Botswana, Brazil, Rwanda, South Africa and Thailand are now on track to reach 80 percent coverage to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission by 2010, up from only 11 countries in 2005. The proportion of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving retroviral drugs to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their children rose by 60 percent from 2005 to 2006 -- although this still means that less than a quarter (23 percent) of all such women get retrovirals. The report also said that the number of HIV-positive children in low- and middle-income countries getting retrovirals rose 70 percent over the same period to 127,000 from 75,000. ""We must provide anti-retroviral treatment for women who require it... to achieve this, health systems and their most precious component, the health care workforce, must be strengthened,"" said Kevin DeCock, director of the WHOs HIV division. The report also welcomed an increase in funds to tackle the disease, even if funding gaps persist. ""Governments and donors alike are allocating more resources to prevention, treatment and protection efforts,"" it said. In 2007, some 10 billion dollars (6.4 billion euros) were available to combat AIDS, up from 6.1 billion dollars the previous year.",{},"['young', 'health', 'women', 'million', 'report', 'hiv', 'children', 'living', 'aids', 'countries', 'treatment', 'billion']","More than two million children worldwide were living with the HIV virus in 2007, most of whom were infected before they were born, a joint study by United Nations humanitarian organisations said Thursday.

Battling HIV/AIDS,,,2008-10-17,The Daily Star,"WHEN the world first learned about HIV/AIDS in the early eighties there was confusion, stigma and little scientific information. At first, many thought it was a disease of homosexuals because the first identified cases were from that group. Almost everybody in the regular society thought the new infection posed no direct threat. However, this turned out to be a myth and, like a bush fire, HIV swept across the globe affecting every single country. Doctors and scientists embarked on rigorous studies and researches for discovering a cure, but a horrible truth emerged -- there was no ready cure because the virus continuously changed its physical structure! So if one element controlled or cured one particular strain, it was ineffective on many other varieties of HIV. For the first time since the bubonic plague of the medieval ages, mankind faced another similar situation of the same magnitude and the only way out is though prevention. The public health specialists from all over the world joined hands and initiated preventive measures on both national and international scale. Even then it took decades of concerted efforts to slow down the onslaught of HIV because like the many shifting physical shapes, HIV also has many routes for spreading and some of these routes are less known or considered for interventions. The social and economic burden of HIV epidemic on a nation is devastating and one has just to look at the African countries to get an idea! HIV infection was detected in Bangladesh around the nineties and, to date, the prevalence in the general population is less than one percent -- meaning there is still no general epidemic. This is no reason for complacency on our part for a number of reasons: The countries surrounding Bangladesh -- India, Mayanmar, China, Thailand -- have either HIV epidemic or very high prevalence; Some Most At Risk Groups (MARG), like Intravenous Drug Users (IDU), in Bangladesh show much higher prevalence at certain sampling points -- the experts call this a ""concentrated epidemic;"" The national serological and behavioural surveillance systems are not comprehensive or concurrent, leaving large gaps through which HIV epidemic may enter; National HIV interventions are not consistent or comprehensive -- for example, last year, there was a drop in the HIV interventions by the NGO network, which implements the bulk of community interventions because there was a drop in donor funding. Most of the interventions cover the most accessible and the most popular locations and target groups; The government is not strengthening implementation of existing safety policies regarding needle safety, clinical waste disposal, decontamination and sterilisation of surgical instruments, blood transfusion, special protection acts for women and children, etc. So, what can we do about HIV prevention in Bangladesh? First of all, we need to pool all available resources and initiate a national policy for coordination and collaboration for HIV interventions. This will immediately improve outcome and reduce wastage of increasingly scarce resources. Secondly, we need to standardise all critical HIV interventions for maximum effect -- for example all messages on condom use, no matter by whom, should say the same thing in exactly the same way. Then we need to prioritise our national HIV interventions so that they will produce maximum effect in minimum possible time. In order to do this we can look at Thailand, which has managed to bring down the HIV infection on a national scale. It is best for us just to copy the two focus areas that the Thailand government acted upon -- consistent condom use and regulations for commercial sex. The other focus areas would include: Strengthening of STI/RTI case detection and treatment, Strict implementation of existing blood transfusion, and surgical instrument and needle safety regulations, with high penalty for noncompliance, Formulation of national clinical waste disposal standards, Formulation and strict implementation of HIV policies regarding migrating populations and Strict implementation of existing women and child protection laws. The last relates to national HIV scene because, in almost all cases of exploitation or abuse of women and children, there is every possibility for HIV infection. We can use existing women empowerment and adolescent programs in this regard. If we start immediately and in a logically planned manner, we can stop HIV in Bangladesh. Our social, cultural and religious environment has kept us safe so far. Now it is for us to take the initiative and drive back the HIV epidemic from our motherland.

Long-acting injection a shot in the arm for GSK's HIV business,"A long-acting injection developed by GlaxoSmithKline and given once a month has proved as effective as standard daily pills for controlling the AIDS virus, lifting prospects for the British drugmaker's key HIV business.",,2018-08-16,The Daily Star,"A long-acting injection developed by GlaxoSmithKline and given once a month has proved as effective as standard daily pills for controlling the AIDS virus, lifting prospects for the British drugmakers key HIV business. GSKs majority-owned ViiV Healthcare unit said on Wednesday the experimental two-drug injection of cabotegravir and rilpivirine maintained similar rates of viral suppression compared with a standard three-drug oral regimen, after 48 weeks of a clinical trial. The result from the big Phase III study is a boost for GSKs goal of developing dual therapies that are easier to tolerate than conventional triple ones, and shares in GSK rose more than 1 percent. It follows recent positive data from combining two oral drugs. GSK hopes its new approach will allow it to compete more effectively against Gilead Sciences, the US drugmaker that dominates the $26 billion-a-year HIV market.

AIDS prevalence alarming: study,,,2014-04-07,The Daily Star,"Almost 1.8 percent of the people of two south-western districts who have a track record of illegal trans-border movement in India have been diagnosed HIV positive, finds a study. The percentage is way higher than the national average of Bangladesh. A total of 2,146 males and females with symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were diagnosed in Satkhira and Jessore between May 2012 and April 3 this year, said Prokriti Nokrek, technical coordinator (monitoring & evaluation and documentation) of Care Bangladesh, which conducted the study. “Of those, 16 were diagnosed with Aids in Satkhira and 22 in Jessore -- two south-western districts of the country having borders with India. Six of them were children,” said Nokrek at a workshop in the capital yesterday. The study titled “Vulnerability to HIV & Aids: A social research on cross border mobile population from Bangladesh to India” was conducted under EMPHASIS, a regional project, involving Bangladesh, Nepal and India. According to government statistics, till December 2013, 3,241 Bangladeshis were found HIV/AIDs positive, which is less than 0.1 percent of its population, whereas the HIV prevalence is 0.3 percent in India and 0.4 percent in Nepal. “Though HIV prevalence in Bangladesh is low, its rate is higher among the mobile populations,” said Abu Taher, team leader of the project. The National Aids and STD Programme Report-2006, Bangladesh, stated that approximately 67 percent of identified HIV-positive cases in the country are returnee migrant workers and their spouses. Abu Taher said, “There is a growing concern that mobile populations are forming a bridge between Bangladesh and the high prevalence areas of India and Nepal”. He said it is not possible to determine the number of total Bangladeshis, who had illegally migrated to India and returned home later. However, many Bangladeshis from the bordering districts go to India for work on better wages, but some of them get engaged in risky sexual activities, he said. Women go to India mainly to work as housemaids, but many are forced to brothels or dance bars, which may ultimately expose them to HIV infection, Taher added. Mirza Manbira Sultana, regional research manager of EMPHASIS project, said though labour migration has become an important development agenda, it is causing major health risks as well. “It is imperative that the authorities immediately intervene to reduce such health risks like HIV/Aids,” she said.",{},"['mobile', 'bangladeshis', 'alarming', 'taher', 'india', 'districts', 'hiv', 'diagnosed', 'aids', 'prevalence', 'study', 'bangladesh']","Almost 1.8 percent of the people of two south-western districts who have a track record of illegal trans-border movement in India have been diagnosed HIV positive, finds a study. “Of those, 16 were diagnosed with Aids in Satkhira and 22 in Jessore -- two south-western districts of the country having borders with India.

Life skills education for youths can check HIV/AIDS risks: Studies,,,2009-04-30,The Daily Star,"The new findings of two studies have revealed that life skills education (LSE) for vulnerable youths can protect them from risk behaviour related to HIV/AIDS, says a press release. The studies found that the programme on LSE for youths aged between 15 and 24 years was well received by communities and the peer-based approach functioned positively among them in 12 selected districts of Dhaka and Khulna divisions. The findings of the studies, jointly carried out by the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP), ICDDR,B and Save the Children-USA, were disseminated at a seminar at ICDDR,B in the city on Tuesday. The researches were conducted under HIV/AIDS Programme: Prevention and Strategic Responses project, a collaborative project between the health and family welfare ministry and Save the Children-USA, supported by the Global Fund. The studies also showed that safe sex practices improved among young people who were trained on life skills by enabling them to face critical situation using intellectual abilities. A national survey conducted by the project in 2005 found that almost one in four unmarried Bangladeshi youths (22 percent) reported having premarital sex. The studies suggested that 30 percent of youths had ever had premarital or extramarital sex, with a higher proportion in the urban areas (33 percent) compared to the rural areas (25 percent). The use of condoms during last sex was 56 percent among youths who had ever had sex. However, LSE intervention improved knowledge and use of condoms among sexually active young people by more than 10 percent. The youths participating identified the correct steps of using condoms and the drug addiction and HIV/AIDS as the most important sessions.

Media should play stronger role in HIV/AIDS awareness,,,2012-09-14,The Daily Star,"The media should play a stronger role in creating awareness of HIV/AIDS among mass people, as it is the easiest and most powerful way to reach people from all walks of life, speakers said at a discussion in Chittagong yesterday. They said medias role in creating awareness is not up to the mark but they are expected to be more efficient in this regard. They were speaking at a media dialogue “Orientation of the media persons on HIV/AIDS” organised by Modhumita Project, an organisation working with HIV/AIDS patients, held at Regional Public Administration Training Centre. Referring to a 2011 data of UNAIDS, the speakers said although the countrys sex workers and their clients are most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, the number of them actually affected by the virus is substantially less than others. Sex workers constitute only 2.7 percent of total affected whereas migrants, who top the list, make up 31 percent of HIV positive. On media role, they said news concerning HIV/AIDS is not well treated by media and even the news items that are published are devalued and not up to standard.

Cure for HIV reportedly 3 years away,A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from,,2016-04-03,The Daily Star,"A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from infected cells and prevent the disease from returning. Scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University are confident that within the next three years they will be able to start human trials, the UK Daily Telegraph reported. British experts believe that this treatment, which has only been tested in labs, would allow the body to effectively “cure itself from the inside,” the newspaper reported. Human immune cells that were tested in the labs have showed no alteration to any other part of the genetic code. “The fact that for the first time we have been able to completely eliminate segments of the viral genome in the laboratory demonstrates that we should be able to eliminate it in the human body,” lead researcher Professor Kamel Khalili told The Telegraph. He reiterated that based on the recent findings, clinical trials could start within the next three years. The new technique is called Crispr/Cas9. It involves targeting the genetic code of HIV which inserts into cells, according to The Telegraph. Scientists then take the Cas9 protein and edit it so it can recognise viral code. The patient’s blood is then taken and scientists would inject Cas9, which would then seek out the HIV virus in the cells. The protein then releases and enzyme and snips out the virus. Scientists are confident that replacing 20 percent of immune cells with genetically altered cells would be enough to cure the virus.",{},"['virus', 'reportedly', 'cells', 'trials', 'cure', 'hiv', 'scientists', 'viral', 'able', 'telegraph', 'human', 'away']","A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from infected cells and prevent the disease from returning.

"33 infected with HIV in Uttar Pradesh after ""quack"" uses tainted syringe","At least 33 people have tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau town of Uttar Pradesh after an unqualified medical practitioner injected some of them with an infected syringe, a government official says.",,2018-02-07,The Daily Star,"At least 33 people have tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau town of Uttar Pradesh after an unqualified medical practitioner injected some of them with an infected syringe, a government official said. The 33 were confirmed from among 566 people tested at government-organised HIV screening camps on Jan. 24, 25 and 27, according to SP Choudhary, chief medical officer (CMO) of Unnao district, which includes Bangarmau. The camps were set up after several suspected HIV cases showed up during routine tests at the district hospitals in Bangarmau late last year, he added. ”We ask HIV patients various things to know the source of infection,“ Choudhary said. ”When we asked these patients whether they had used common syringes, some of them told us about a doctor they went to who uses the same syringe on all his patients.” Arun Pratap Singh, a Bangarmau police official, said an investigative file had been opened against the suspect doctor identified as Rajendra Kumar. Singh said Kumar had gone into hiding and police were searching for him. He said the doctor could be charged with carrying out a negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases, voluntarily causing grievous harm by using dangerous weapons or means, and practising medicine without having registration as a medical practitioner with the state government. Choudhary said he was not sure how many of the 33 cases were connected to Kumar, but that an investigation by a state government committee was continuing. “Patients have told us this man is about 35 years old and would go around on a bicycle, giving out pills and injections to treat colds, coughs and other ailments. He is a quack,” Choudhary said. A shortage of doctors in India leads many patients to depend on unqualified practitioners, many of whom work out of hole-in-the-wall clinics in rural areas. The Indian Medical Association estimates that about 45 percent of the people in India who practice medicine have no formal training. Critics have in the past blamed a lack of stringent criminal penalties that allow quacks to thrive. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state run by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has a sketchy healthcare record in a country whose spending on medical care ranks among the lowest in the world as a percentage of GDP. Dozens of deaths from encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh last year led to a firestorm of criticism of the states chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, who took office early last year.

Religious leaders urged to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS,,,2008-10-19,The Daily Star,"The speakers at an inter-divisional dialogue here yesterday called on the religious leaders to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and anti-social activities. Regarded as the most trustworthy and respected persons, religious leaders and teachers have easy access to all classes of people in society, they said. The religious leaders can explain the sexual behaviour in the light of their respective religions and make the people aware of safe physical relationships to help prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the speakers added. The inter-divisional dialogue titled The role of religions in preventing HIV/AIDS and other diseases was organised at the local circuit house. Joint Secretary of the religious affairs ministry AHM Afzal Hossain presided over the dialogue attended by religious leaders, intellectuals, academicians and women leaders. Divisional Commissioner of Chittagong Hossain Jamil was present as the chief guest while Deputy Commissioner Ashraf Shamim was the special guest at the dialogue organised in association with Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, Chittagong division. The divisional commissioner said, ""We have to have a scientific outlook and religious approach to prevent STDs and other disease."" Addressing the dialogue, Afzal Hossain said it was the first inter-religious dialogue the government had organised focusing on HIV/AIDS and other diseases. He hoped that leaders of different religions and organisations would help the government reach out to the general public and build a healthy nation. The dialogue scheduled to be held in six divisional cities was also organised simultaneously in Sylhet and Barisal yesterday and it would be finally organised in Dhaka on November 1, he informed. Dr AFM Khalid Hossain of MES University College in Chittagong, Child Specialist Dr Dilip Dey, Bangladesh Buddha Samity Vice President Prof Jitendra Lal Barua and Dr Sanai Pru Tripura of Leprosy Mission at Khulshi presented keynote papers focusing on the prevention of STDs and other diseases in the light of their respective religions. They said a total of 3.32 crore people were identified HIV- positives across the globe till the end of 2007. Some 2.01 crore people, including 3.30 lakh children died of AIDS so far, adding that three-forth of these tragic deaths took place in the Sub-Saharan countries in Africa, causing huge losses of human resources and financial growth of the region. As per the latest UNAIDS statistics of 2007, around 6800 people are being infected with HIV in the world a day, they added. Some 25 lakh people were infected with HIV only in 2007. Mostly the adolescents and youths aged 15 to 24 years fell victim to AIDS. Socio-economic discrimination and ignorance of religious rules made the young people most vulnerable to these diseases. Director of Islamic Foundation Chittagong Abul Hyat Md Tareque gave the address of welcome at the dialogue which was also attended by Principal Syed Abu Noman, Prof Anowara Alam, Dr Jin Byodhi Bhixmu, Moulana Ahmudur Rahman, poet and journalist Bishwajit Chowdhury, journalists Helal Humayun and Hasan Akber, Prof Monirul Islam Rafiq and Prof BM Mafizur Rahman.",{},"['raise', 'hossain', 'chittagong', 'prof', 'hivaids', 'religions', 'religious', 'organised', 'stds', 'urged', 'awareness', 'dialogue', 'leaders']","The speakers at an inter-divisional dialogue here yesterday called on the religious leaders to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and anti-social activities.

“Megher Koley Rode” Generating awareness on HIV/AIDS,,,2008-08-13,The Daily Star,"In her latest film, Megher Koley Rode, director Nargis Akter has followed the ""formula"" of ""mainstream cinema"" and has dealt with a contemporary global issue. Done in conventional ""Dhaliwood style"", the film features dances, playbacks and fights in a decent manner, and addresses the wrong perceptions of HIV/AIDS. For the most part, the cast and crew of the film includes are also from the mainstream movie industry. Megher Koley Rode is full of drama and action. USP of the film is proportionate acting by mainstream actors such as Riaz, Poppy, Ahmed Sharif, Diti and Kabori. Even the debutant Tony Dias performed well. Director Nargis Akter deserves plaudits for managing her actors to perform realistically. Nargis Akters story and screenplay, especially the dialogue diction, have been aptly done. Two Bangladeshi students -- Rodela (Poppy) and Nijhum (Tony Dias) -- studying at a Malaysian University face a problem regarding accommodation, as the Malaysians deny to rent apartments/ houses to an unmarried couple. Dramatically they meet a Bangladeshi expatriate (Diti), who is a psychiatrist by profession. She solves the problem. A triangular love story is introduced when Uday (Riaz), after completing his Bar at Law degree from UK, comes to meet his best friend Nijhum in Malaysia. Riaz in the character of a flirtatious, fun loving, young chap has performed spontaneously throughout the cinema. Poppys performance in the multidimensional character of Rodela is worth mentioning. Perhaps the audience has never seen Poppy perform with such conviction, though she is a popular film actor and has won national awards in acting. Her portrayal of aesthetic sentiments as per the requirements of actions deserves plaudit. Tony Dias also performed well in the role of an unsure, insecure individual who always goes by his parents decisions and cannot even express his love for Rodela. Realising Nijhums deep love for Rodela, Uday decides to go back to London, though this is for the first time he has been in true love. The triangular love story has been visualised in the intriguing locations of Malaysia. A new drama begins when Nijhum and Rodela decide to go back to Bangladesh and marry. On the wedding night when the bride is waiting for the groom, he does not come suspecting Rodela is HIV positive, as his relative seeing the picture of Rodelas parents identifies them as aids victims who died when Rodela was born. Nijhums parents create pressure on their son to divorce Rodela on the following day of their wedding. The incident leads the cinema to a lengthy court scene, which sometimes appeared monotonous. For a change Ahmed Sharif, who usually plays negative characters in mainstream films, is seen delivering a credible performance. As per the formula, Uday comes from London to defend Rodela. Playing a gynaecologist, seasoned actor Kabori proves to the court that Rodela is not a HIV positive. If the mother is properly treated under the supervision of an expert doctor, a newborn does not necessarily carry the virus. However, the film has a few flaws. Actions are not properly portrayed in many scenes such as the scene featuring Khurshiduzzaman Utpal (playing Riazs maternal uncle in the film), meets his ex-fiancé Diti after 12 years.

This year, as 18,000 scientists, policymakers, advocates and people living with HIV return to Durban, South Africa, AIDS 2016 will highlight the latest accomplishments and challenges in a rapidly expanding area of scientific inquiry that few could have imagined at the first Durban conference – the prospect of developing safe, effective, and globally scalable approaches to curing or achieving sustained remission of HIV infection. “HIV cure research has the potential to alter the future of this epidemic,” said Nobel Laureate Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, co-chair of the IAS Towards an HIV Cure Initiative. “With 37 million people currently living with HIV worldwide, and another 2 million newly infected each year, an effective approach to curing or achieving sustained remission of HIV infection would be a groundbreaking advance in global health.

Adolescents falling through gaps in HIV services,,,2013-12-01,The Daily Star,"More than 2 million adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 years are living with HIV, and many do not receive the care and support that they need to stay in good health and prevent transmission. In addition, millions more adolescents are at risk of infection. The failure to support effective and acceptable HIV services for adolescents has resulted in a 50% increase in reported AIDS-related deaths in this group compared with the 30% decline seen in the general population from 2005 to 2012. The new recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) ""HIV and adolescents: Guidance for HIV testing and counselling and care for adolescents living with HIV"" are the first to address the specific needs of adolescents both for those living with HIV as well as those who are at risk of infection. The recommendations have been released recently on occasion of World AIDS Day 2013 which is being observed today. Expert from WHO said that adolescents face difficult and often confusing emotional and social pressures as they grow from children into adults. Adolescents need health services and support, tailored to their needs. They are less likely than adults to be tested for HIV and often need more support than adults to help them maintain care and to stick to treatment. Adolescent girls, young men who have sex with men, those who inject drugs or are subject to sexual coercion and abuse are at highest risk. Experts identified many barriers, including harsh laws, inequalities, stigma and discrimination which prevent them from accessing services that could test, prevent, and treat HIV. About one-seventh of all new HIV infections occur during adolescence. Unless the barriers are removed, the dream of an AIDS-free generation will never be realised. WHO recommends governments review their laws to make it easier for adolescents to obtain HIV testing without needing consent from their parents. The guidelines also suggest ways that health services can improve the quality of care and social support for adolescents. And they highlight the value of involving this age group to create an adolescent-centered approach to the services that work for people of their age. Young people need to be better equipped to manage their HIV infection and take ownership of their health care. Zimbabwe has set an example of such leadership by developing adolescent friendly services, and as a result they achieved good treatment outcomes among adolescents. Experts urge all countries to be inspired by these examples and strengthen support for adolescents living with HIV.

Misleading AIDS info dangeraous for nation,,,2010-11-29,The Daily Star,"Disseminating accurate information on HIV/AIDS and their usage in daily life are the key to prevent spread of the deadly disease, panelists told a roundtable yesterday. As there is no treatment of the disease, prevention is the only way to ward off the fatal infection, they said, adding that wrong or misleading information about it can turn out to be dangerous for the nation. The HIV situation in the country, however, is far better than in neighbouring countries with the prevalence of HIV/AIDS one percent, they said, stressing the need for continuing the prevention programmes. Speakers also noted that media has an immense role in filling the information gap and making the young people aware of how the killer virus is transmitted. The roundtable titled “Jante hobe-janate hobe” (Know and let know) was jointly organised by daily Prothom Alo, Prothom Alo Bandhushava, National AIDS/STD Programme and Save the Children at Prothom Alos office in the capital. ""Information is the main vaccine against the disease,"" said Dr Nizamuddin Ahmed, director of HIV/AIDS department of Save the Children, USA. Talking about government measures, he said Bangladesh is the most successful country in Asia and second in the world in preventing HIV/AIDS. The knowledge about the disease has increased; usage of condoms has doubled and the topic has been incorporated in school curriculum from grade 6 to 12, he added. Prothom Alo Joint Editor Abdul Qaiyum said the disease spreads mainly for lack of awareness. The infection rate of AIDS is increasing in Asia while it is decreasing elsewhere in the world, he added insisting that awareness is a must to fight it. Hasan Mahmud, deputy programme manager of National AIDS/STD Programme of the government, said government has been working to prevent the disease integrating all the stakeholders. The main objective of the programme is to keep the prevalence rate at the same level, he added. ""We have to keep the process of dissemination on, as the more the people know the less the risk will be,"" said Habiba Akhter Chowdhury, chairperson of PLHIV Network of Bangladesh. She said the migrant workers who are extremely vulnerable to the disease must be informed properly about the disease before they leave for overseas jobs. Abu Yusuf Chowdhury, chairperson of STI/AIDS Network of Bangladesh, said time has come to cut dependency on donor agencies and mobilise internal resources to continue the fight against it.

There are over 20 anti-HIV drugs available worldwide that can restore health, prolong life of the person living with HIV/AIDS and significantly reduce transmission of the virus to those not infected. However, drugs do not eradicate HIV and people are exposed to its potential toxic effects for life. Moreover, the expense to adhere to therapy for indefinite period is enormous specially in resource-poor setting. Developing an effective vaccine is another potential area to end epidemic. But success of this effort is still far away and has not yet shown very promising result. In these contexts, keeping the quest to cure HIV is crucial and the efforts need to be intensified to get a potential solution to end the epidemic and save money and resource for other emerging crisis. A number of recent advancements in proving an effective cure that shed light and renew optimism to peruse cure research. The case of Timothy Brown, the so-called “Berlin Patient”, who received a stem-cell bone-marrow transplant in 2007 and is now considered to be cured of HIV has proved that a cure is at least possible. There is also a rare group of HIV infected people who appear to have naturally cured their own infection are being examined and researched extensively to find a clue for cure. The major challenge to cure is the latent HIV reservoirs — where HIV hides and persists in unreachable location that does not eradicated by drugs. Some recent researches have shown that drugs in combination can unmask latent virus that might allow clearance of infection and boost immune defense. Researches also revealed that benefit of early treatment that can successfully stop the need of drug after a certain period without viral rebound. A group of international experts convened by the International AIDS Society (IAS) have very recently developed a roadmap for research towards an HIV cure. It highlighted the need of more investment in cure research, establishment of large, multinational collaborations involving experts from multiple disciplines (basic and clinical scientists including those outside of the HIV arena), mentoring and supporting young researchers with out of box ideas and strong community support for advocacy.",{},"['virus', 'potential', 'quest', 'hivaids', 'cure', 'end', 'hiv', 'need', 'research', 'drugs', 'treatment']","Finding a cure for HIV was a dare dream for decades.

HIV positive people and stigma,,,2010-12-26,The Daily Star,"World Aids Day 2010 was recently observed. To create awareness, our government also observed the day in collaboration with the NGOs. But do we think really about the situation of the HIV positive persons in our country? They are often discriminated against and stigmatised in different ways. An HIV positive person is considered polygamous, even if he/she is not, in Bangladesh where polygamy is treated negatively by the society. He/she faces hatred, and is often shunned by his/her own friends and family. The cruelty towards the HIV positive people commonly results in no access to the job market, refusal in giving inheritance property, and even refusal by doctors to provide medical treatment. Afraid of being ostracised by the society HIV positive people often do not disclose their problems to anyone, which results in physical and mental suffering. To reduce the stigma and discrimination regarding HIV/Aids we have to speak positively about the sufferers. As citizens of this country it is our responsibility to take part in combating HIV/Aids, and there is a window of opportunity to prevent this pandemic. We must ensure provision of universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010 as our social responsibility. Since the onset of the epidemic, experience has clearly demonstrated that significant advances in the response to HIV have been achieved when there is strong and committed leadership. We should work on reducing the stigma on HIV/Aids. We have to advocate for the rights of those living with and affected by HIV/Aids through sensitisation of groups, communities and society for creating positive, friendly and supportive relationship with families and friends. We also have to support empowerment of the people with HIV so they can take control of their lives. We have to take the private sector on board. Health workers should not refuse to provide treatment to HIV-positive people. In our country the first case of HIV/Aids was detected in 1989. Since then, 2088 cases of HIV/Aids have been confirmed. 37 people died as of December 1, and the total death toll is 241 till date. The estimated total number of people living with HIV/Aids in Bangladesh is around 7,500 as of December 2009. We should acknowledge persons or organisations that have helped support the cause, and continue the good and supporting relationship between the government and NGOs. The main focus should be on sensitising our communities to respect and accept people living with HIV (PLHIV), and on preventing the spread of HIV. We should not be judgmental as to how they got infected. Most of all we should learn to love them, and then the rest will follow. The human rights and stigma situation has improved a bit because nowadays we can talk about sex workers, drug users, clients of sex workers, people living with HIV/Aids and adolescents. Refusal of services to them is prohibited in Bangladesh. Targeted interventions are inadequate because of lack of involvement of media, inadequate monitoring, evaluation and research, lack of proper planning and implementation of HIV and human rights programmes, absence of drug substitution, and lack of general understanding of people living with HIV/Aids. A positive role of civil society in addressing the issues can make a big change in combating HIV. The government should invest in research and documentation. Institutions should use the best practices and share them with the policy level stakeholders. The voice of the HIV positive people should be raised through media campaign. Entry training and in service training should be provided for HIV/Aids in education awareness and media. Political commitment needs to be strengthened To remove the stigma on HIV we need to organise talk shows to raise awareness. The programmes should be implemented for the target people or the clients according to the demand. Law enforcing agencies and the community should be involvement. There should be an active human rights watch groups for reducing stigma and discrimination, and legislation for sex work in brothels, streets and hotels until the government can provide them socio economic security. There should be implementation of existing policies.

Law and Our Rights,,,,,"Human Rights Monitor Whether HIV should be a valid ground for divorce Zahidul Islam AN Indian court holding that HIV is a valid ground for divorce caused a huge controversy recently. The Indian society seems still divided on the issue of how the HIV infected couple should be dealt with legally. The Indian government figures the number of people in India with HIV/AIDS at between two million and 3.1 million, while UN Aids estimates there were 5.7 million cases in 2006. Hence, this is a grave issue for India. Though I dont have any data near to hand this moment as to how many people are officially figured as AIDS patients in Bangladesh, certainly the number is increasing day by day. So, it is an equally important issue for Bangladesh. Hence, the aim of this article is to stimulate the public thought over the issue by describing an Indian example. Although I am yet to collect the controversial judgment that I have mentioned above, from the different Indian national dailies I can summarise the fact that a couple from Kerala had married in October 2000 and moved to the capital. Five months after their marriage, the wife was found to be HIV positive in a medical test conducted during her pregnancy. Tests showed the husband hadnt contracted the dreaded virus. The husband could not accept it, and moved to the court for granting him a divorce order. Following a long way of court proceedings, judgment came out on 1st November 2007, creating huge controversy among citizenry. What exactly was the decision of the court of law? In a single sentence the decision was that a person whose spouse is found to be HIV positive is justified in seeking a divorce. Delivering the judgment, additional district Judge Rajnish Bhatnagar said that a person cannot live happily with a spouse who has AIDS or is HIV positive. The judge thus granted divorce to a man whose wife was HIV positive, saying her ailment had prevented him from leading a happy married life as the disease is sexually communicable. The district court also held the petitioners wife guilty of not disclosing her HIV positive state before marriage. According to a Supreme Court ruling in 1998, people who are HIV-positive must inform future spouses. The court also observed that sex is an integral part of marriage and in this particular case the husband was deprived of that enjoyment. The HIV status of the wife no doubt resulted in non-enjoyment of sexual intercourse between the parties and marriage without sex is an anathema. However, reaction to the decision is mixed. While the majority of Indian general people seem to have welcomed the decision, AIDS activists have expressed dismay over the negative impact of the judgment. Though they have termed the decision to seek divorce as a matter of personal choice, they are concerned about the negative impact that the judgment might incur on societys perceptions of HIV positive people. While commenting on it, Dushyant Meher, and AIDS activist and AIDS programme coordinator of Salaam Balak Trust, said that this is a conflict between the rights of an HIV positive person and a healthy person. In this case, the court has given precedence to the rights of the healthy person. He added that it also needed to be understood that the woman too has a right to family life. Parenthetically, I would like to mention another comment by an AIDS activist Anjali Gopalan, who pointed out in almost all cases where the man is HIV positive and the woman is not, the woman never seeks divorce. In response to the comment, some newspaper readers opined that here is no problem with law or court. If any wife seeks divorce from HIV positive husband, it is expected that the court will in the same way grant the wife the divorce permission. However, the central argument of the AIDS activists is that HIV/AIDS patients are particularly vulnerable members of our society. The vast majority of people of our society are still unknowledgeable about what is AIDS, and how it is transmitted. Majority of them think AIDS is just a sexually transmitted disease, which is just a result of indisciplined, unusual and irreligious sexual practices. But this is a fallacy. Unfortunately, this misconception or fallacy is dominant in our society. Still the people with HIV/AIDS are tested without their consent, their confidentiality is breached and they are discriminated against in providing medical treatment, in provision of services like employment etc. In the like way, in the society they lose their respect; they are avoided, if not boycotted. When this is the scenario, the judgment treating HIV as a ground of divorce will, on the one hand, help decline their social position, on the other hand, weaken their psychological strength. According to these AIDS activists, we must understand that HID/AIDS is not a crime for which one should get punishment, but it is a dreadful disease for which one needs proper treatment and social support, and judiciary should be concerned about their human rights. While this is the argument of the AIDS activists disagreeing with the judgment, the legal basis of the judgment is easily understandable. Almost all marriage laws - for example, personal laws of Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Persian, as well as Special Marriage Act - provide the venereal disease or sexually transmitted disease as a ground for divorce to either husband or wife. But at the same time, it is also true that it is neither just a matter of law nor a personal affair between husband and wife; it relates public health, society, religion and morality as well. The issue gives birth to many questions, such as, does the HIV positive patient who was once divorced on this ground have right to remarry? Or does an AIDS patient have legal right to marry when the disease is likely to affect his/her spouse? Does she have right to give birth to children, when the baby is like to be affected? Should there be a provision of producing AIDS certificate while entering into a marriage contract? Is it practicable in the socio-economic conditions in Bangladesh? Should there be a mandatory provision that the Bangladeshi people employed in foreign countries shall undergo HIV test when they are getting married or reuniting their families at home? Is it morally correct to do so? Or will it violate their human rights or right to privacy? Should their individual human rights be protected, or should the overwhelming public health interest be prioritised? It is therefore a grave public concern that warrants a huge public debate and adoption of a public policy. If the issue of separation or divorce on the ground of HIV/AIDS is yet to visit the court rooms in Bangladesh, certainly it will do it soon. So, we must think of it now so that we can adopt an all agreed prudent policy that will ensure human rights of the HIV patients as well as public health.

HIV threat gets ominous for improper info flow,,,2010-11-03,The Daily Star,"A significant number of young people in Bangladesh are vulnerable to HIV infection, as they are not getting proper information on how to prevent the disease, experts said. Blaming the absence of proper information dissemination process, they said the youth are engaging in risky behaviours like unsafe intercourse and certain drug abuse that pose a threat of spreading HIV. The opinions came up at a roundtable on Strategic Information and HIV Prevention Among Adolescents organised jointly by The Daily Star and the UNFPA at The Daily Stars conference room yesterday. The discussants said media could play a crucial role in filling the information gap and make the young people aware of how the deadly virus is transmitted. They stressed the need for public-private partnership, linkage between formal and informal sectors, central and local governments, modern and folk media working together to combat the HIV threat. The opinion of the young people should be considered while formulating HIV prevention policies and strategies, they observed. ""We need to make sure that the epidemic will not spread,"" said UNFPAs Country Representative Arthur Erken. Even after the inclusion of HIV/AIDS issue in textbooks, the teachers and parents often feel embarrassed to discuss it with adolescents, Erken said. ""Here comes the role of media, which can inform and educate people of all classes regarding the fatal infection,"" he added. The UNFPA representative, who moderated the session, also said the enormous power of social media like facebook could be used in disseminating information and that can be managed by the youths themselves. The message use condoms does not work much. The use of condoms should be considered as part of a healthy lifestyle. If condoms are sold from a lifestyle perspective, it will be more attractive and the message would be more positive, he said. Nizamuddin Ahmed of Save the Children, USA, said 25 percent of 160 million people in Bangladesh are aged between 15 and 24 years and a significant number of them do not go to any educational institutions. So programmes should be extended beyond the educational institutions, he added. Quoting a study, he said around 90 percent of young people know about HIV/AIDS but 25 percent of them do not know how it spreads, he said. Only 1.2 percent believe that they are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. The study was conducted on 12,000 young people of the country, he said. Criticising programmes on HIV/AIDS, he said most of the programmes halted midway due to fund crisis, management problems and other reasons. ""The average age of Bangladeshi children entering sex trade is 13 years… So they are badly in need of right information and right services,"" said Bridget Johnson, HIV/AIDS specialist of Unicef Bangladesh. Tasnim Azim, head of HIV programme of ICDDRB, said, ""We need to think how to integrate the HIV/AIDS with other issues."" Lack of youth-friendly health service centres and supportive and safe environment were blamed for making the youth vulnerable. They suggested conducting an in-depth study on school curriculum and to revise them. Khandaker Ezazul Haque, HIV officer of the UNFPA Bangladesh, presented the keynote paper.

The link between GBV and HIV infections,"WORLD AIDS Day (WAD) celebrated on the first of December every year since 1988 aims to increase awareness of the disease, fight the",,2015-12-01,The Daily Star,"WORLD AIDS Day (WAD) celebrated on the first of December every year since 1988 aims to increase awareness of the disease, fight the stigma associated with it, improve HIV education, and mobilize resources for the global response to the epidemic.The commemoration coincides with the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence campaign, no coincidence as the links between GBV and HIV/AIDS are very clear. On a global scale, but also in Bangladesh HIV is increasingly impacting adolescent girls and young women. They are vulnerable owing to violence, child marriage, lack of comprehensive sexuality education, inability to negotiate safe sex, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services – including condoms, HIV/STI testing and counselling, and treatment. Although the HIV prevalence in Bangladesh is low, still under 0.1%, the demographics of Bangladesh present considerable challenges to the HIV prevention program. Bangladesh is a densely populated country, with enduring poverty, low levels of education, gender inequality and high levels of cross border travel. In Asia Pacific between 2005 and 2013, new infections declined by 6%. But in Bangladesh the estimated new infections increased by 25% from 2001 to 2012 and the reported new infections in Bangladesh increased by about 1.5 times over the past 5 years. The estimated number of people living with HIV in Bangladesh is 9500. However only approximately one third of these people have been diagnosed as living with HIV and only 1150 people are enrolled in care. Bangladesh provides free anti-retroviral treatment to all who need it. In order for the treatment opportunities to really have an impact it is however paramount for people to know their HIV status. Bangladesh still has very limited health facilities which offer testing and counselling for HIV. HIV testing and counselling therefore needs to be upgraded and integrated into mixed models of community-based testing, this is possible by linking it to sexual and reproductive health services. About a third of newly diagnosed cases in 2014 affected women and in 10 percent of new cases the diagnosed person was between the ages of 19 and 24. The high number of external and internal migrants and the low level of accurate knowledge, especially young people have about HIV are contributing risk factors in Bangladesh.Addressing restrictive social norms that prevent women and girls from accessing sexual and reproductive health information and services and owning their sexual health is crucial. Concerted efforts are needed to change these gender norms and to make communities safe and supportive for young women and girls. We need to empower adolescent and young people with knowledge; only 13% of females and 23% of males between15 and 24 correctly identify ways of preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and reject major misconceptions about HIV transmission in Bangladesh. Based on the National Strategic Plan we know that Most At Risk Adolescents (MARA) are one of the key vulnerable populations for getting infected with HIV. Responding to HIV/AIDS also needs to address gender-based violence. Vulnerability to HIV is intertwined with GBV and therefore requires integrated actions. The rate of GBV in Bangladesh is high, as we know from a survey on violence against women from 2011. Actions to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls must also include HIV response. Prevention, screening and access to health, social services and post-exposure prophylaxis as well as diagnosis and treatment need to be part and parcel of health sector response to GBV. We also need to roll back punitive laws and policies that promote stigma and discrimination and disempower people from accessing services The Sustainable Development Goals call on us to leave no one behind. Investment is needed in local data and services to ensure that we reach the most vulnerable. We must invest in the holistic development of adolescents through education, health, employment and psychological well-being. We must ensure people in humanitarian crises, conflict and other emergency situations have access to an effective package of sexual and reproductive health services, including for prevention and treatment of HIV and STIs. We must intensify programming with key populations to reduce their HIV burden and protect the whole community. UNFPA continues to support governments and community organizations to strengthen integrated maternal and child health services, as well as community-led responses. We support the human rights of key populations to live free of violence, stigma and discrimination and to freely access services in order to protect their health, the health of their sexual partners and dependents, and ultimately, of the whole community. By focusing on what works, and by working together, we can end AIDS by 2030.

HIV awareness building imperative,,,2007-12-01,The Daily Star,"At a roundtable discussion on prevention of HIV/AIDS a must, speakers have called for open dialoguing at all levels of the society for sensitising people about HIV and its dreadful consequences. An atmosphere should be created so that open discussion can take place at all tiers of society, including at the family level. The discussion meeting participated by a cross section of the people including sex workers and representatives from various international organisations operating in the country stressed the need for shunning the tendency of treating the subject as something of a taboo. At the forum no less than the Adviser in Charge of Health and Family Planning pointed out that most people in the country often get panicked when they hear of HIV/AIDS and consider it as an evil omen. Those who have already contracted HIV often tend to hide the fact and hence it is difficult to assess the actual number of people afflicted in the country and the overall prevailing scenario. We are in full agreement with the observations made by speakers that there is no reason for complacency despite the fact that only minuscule percentage of the population lives under the looming threat of the disease. Bangladesh is a risk-prone area surrounded as it is by countries which have a rather high incidence of HIV/AIDS. We can also learn from them the ways they are grappling with the problem. There is no alternative to building extensive social awareness about the disease more so amongst the vulnerable groups like slum dwellers, floating destitute people, truck drivers, sex workers, etc. It is high time too that the media campaign on the preventive and curative aspects of the disease is also further geared up. Periodic monitoring of the schools and colleges should also take place to ensure that the teachers regularly teach the students the prescribed text on the subject. Allegedly, teachers themselves have often been found reluctant to teach the subject. There is yet another aspect government should pay urgent attention to. More and more easily accessible diagnostic centres should be opened for diagnosing people suspected of having contracted the HIV, free of cost.",{},"['building', 'discussion', 'workers', 'subject', 'country', 'hivaids', 'teach', 'speakers', 'hiv', 'disease', 'imperative', 'awareness', 'teachers']","At a roundtable discussion on prevention of HIV/AIDS a must, speakers have called for open dialoguing at all levels of the society for sensitising people about HIV and its dreadful consequences.

Strategic use of HIV medicines could help end transmission,,,2012-07-28,The Daily Star,"More strategic use of antiretroviral HIV medications can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus and reduce new infections dramatically, says World Health Organisation (WHO). On the basis of this evidence, WHO advice for more strategic use of antiretrovirals includes: * New guidelines for treating people with HIV who have uninfected partners (‘serodiscordant’ couples), recommending that antiretroviral therapy (ARVs ) be offered to the HIV-positive partner, regardless of the strength of his or her immune system, to reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission to the uninfected partner. Up to 50% of HIV-positive people in on-going relationships are estimated to have HIV-negative partners. * ARVs should be given to all HIV positive pregnant women, regardless of the strength of their immune system, and has them continue taking the medicines for life. This not only treats HIV infected women and prevents transmission to their infants, it can also protect their partners. * Evidence suggests that early treatment of HIV infected persons can make the virus silent, prevent the rebound of virus, reduce the need of lifelong medication. WHO is now reviewing recent studies that point to the potential health benefits of giving ARVs earlier, before the immune system starts to weaken. * In addition to more targeted treatment approaches recent studies suggest ARVs can also be used to protect people who are currently HIV-negative, but are at high risk of becoming infected like intravenous drug users, sex workers etc.",{},"['virus', 'transmission', 'women', 'infected', 'immune', 'system', 'end', 'hiv', 'partners', 'strategic', 'reduce', 'arvs', 'help', 'medicines']","More strategic use of antiretroviral HIV medications can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus and reduce new infections dramatically, says World Health Organisation (WHO). * ARVs should be given to all HIV positive pregnant women, regardless of the strength of their immune system, and has them continue taking the medicines for life.

Modern HIV prevention: What’s next for women?,"Recently, some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers gathered in Boston at the Conference on Retroviruses and",,2016-02-28,The Daily Star,"Recently, some of the world’s leading scientists and researchers gathered in Boston at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). “What’s next for women?” was the question on the minds of many, after results were released from two trials that looked at one of the most promising new HIV prevention tools of our time: the long-acting dapivirine vaginal ring, a female-controlled HIV prevention method that could potentially protect women for up to a month at a time. ASPIRE (MTN 020) and The Ring Study (IPM 027) looked at the safety and effectiveness of these women-controlled devices; their results were among the most anticipated data to be released at the conference. The news from CROI was encouraging and potentially far-reaching – trial results found the ring to be effective in preventing HIV infection among women (27% and 31% protection overall among the roughly 4,500 women enrolled in these two studies). This is truly a major advance for the field of HIV prevention, especially for women. It is clear – as was the case with oral PrEP – that we need to move quickly to open-label and demonstration projects to understand the real-world impact of this new intervention. The vaginal ring is one more addition to an already exciting array of antiretroviral-based biomedical options in the prevention toolbox that has ushered in a new era in HIV prevention. For the first time, a real prevention menu is beginning to take shape. Despite immense progress in diagnostics and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, every year roughly two million people worldwide become newly infected with HIV. The situation is particularly grim for women and young girls in sub-Saharan Africa, where women account for more than half of all people living with HIV, and the burden of disease continues to increase among young women. Offering a variety of effective prevention approaches to suit diverse needs for diverse populations at different times in their lives is the key to controlling the epidemic, at least until there is a vaccine and a cure. Interventions that address gender-based violence and the socioeconomic needs of young women must also be part of this comprehensive response. Our focus needs to remain inclusive, involving community mobilization and leadership at all levels. It must also be broad, encompassing the biomedical, behavioural, and structural components of combination prevention while respecting, protecting, and promoting sexual reproductive health and rights. There is still much more to be done. There is an urgent need to deploy the tools in the right way to the right people. At the same time, we must continue to explore new innovations that will improve and further expand the menu of prevention options for women. The exciting results from ASPIRE and The Ring Study bring new hope in this area.",{},"['results', 'modern', 'women', 'study', 'vaginal', 'whats', 'ring', 'hiv', 'needs', 'young', 'tools', 'prevention']","“What’s next for women?” was the question on the minds of many, after results were released from two trials that looked at one of the most promising new HIV prevention tools of our time: the long-acting dapivirine vaginal ring, a female-controlled HIV prevention method that could potentially protect women for up to a month at a time.

Early treatment for HIV 'makes virus 96% less infectious',,,2011-05-14,The Daily Star,"HIV carriers who start treatment before the virus can ravage their immune systems are 96 per cent less likely to infect their partner, a landmark new study has found. The findings are a breakthrough in combating the spread of HIV. In theory, if every person carrying the virus was treated at the earliest opportunity, the spread of Aids could almost be stopped in its tracks. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded the study, said: These findings strongly indicate that treating an individual sooner rather than later can reduce the risk of HIV transmission to a sex partner. Current medical guidelines suggest starting treatment when a sufferers CD4 T-cell count - a measure of the strength of the immune system - drops to between 350 to 500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood. But the new study suggests that immediate treatment can make carriers 27 times less likely to pass on the virus. In 2005 researchers enrolled 1,763 couples in 13 sites in Botswana, Brazil, India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, the US and Zimbabwe. Each couple had one partner who was infected with the virus and another who was not. Half of the infected partners began treatment with a combination of three HIV drugs. The other HIV-infected partners treatment was delayed until they showed signs of an Aids-related illness or their T-cell count fell to 250. An interim analysis of the study, which was due to continue until 2015, showed that of the 28 infections between partners, 27 had come from those in the delayed treatment group. Michel Sidibé, executive director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids, told The Guardian: This breakthrough is a serious game changer and will drive the prevention revolution forward.",{},"['virus', 'spread', 'partner', 'early', 'tcell', 'study', 'likely', 'showed', 'hiv', 'partners', 'infectious', 'makes', 'treatment', '96']","HIV carriers who start treatment before the virus can ravage their immune systems are 96 per cent less likely to infect their partner, a landmark new study has found.

AIDS threat looms up: Aggressive surveillance needed,,,2013-12-14,The Daily Star,"Health officials and concerned citizenry in the country are grappling with the national implications of AIDS crisis that hovers over lands beyond the borders of Bangladesh and have been trying to come up with means to combat the new threat that it poses to Bangladesh. Experts see clear indications that the disease that once was supposed to be confined to some specific areas is now spreading to wider residential neighbourhoods. The alarm bell is ringing at the door. Figures so far available in India are restricted to the so-called high risk groups-prostitutes, heterosexuals, drug addicts, truck drivers and migrants. Africa disproportionately bears the burden of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Although only 11% of the worlds population lives in Africa, roughly 67% of those living with HIV/AIDS are in Africa. In Africa there were 22.4 million people living with HIV and the country recorded 1.9 million new infections in 2008. An estimated 14 million children in Africa have been orphaned as a result of HIV/AIDS. Officially, no exact statistics are available that speak of the countrys middle class becoming AIDS victims as yet. Reports that pour in from the neighbouring country, India indicate that there are about 5.134 million HIV infected people in India, constituting about 0.6% of the total population. Although the percentage is small, the numbers are staggering, the highest of any country, overtaking South Africa. All these reports make people genuinely concerned, since in no time, the virus may cross the borders with the traveling people and can play havoc in the country. On the other hand, that the reported HIV positive numbers in the country still remain relatively quite low, not anything to cause alarm, is no surprise. It reflects the general level of ignorance and a sort of apathy of the people and administration. The actual number infected with the virus may be quite high. The majority of the people who are infected now dont even know they are ill. We are now talking about a generation that will have developed AIDS sometime after the year 2020 or later. And the country simply does not have the wherewithal to deal with any such crisis. Complacency and ignorance do not always pay as it did not in the CIS (previously USSR) countries. Unicef reports that abuse of injected drugs accounts for most of the regions infections of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. However it noted that sexual transmission is on the rise in Belarus and Ukraine. The total number of infections in the region more than doubled from 4,20,000 in 1998 to I million in 2001. While that is small compared to 28.5 million in sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of infection in some East European and CIS countries is the worlds highest. Most worrisome, the virus now percolates insidiously and afflicts low risk individuals like house wives and children of wealthy people. Speaking about India, a doctor who heads the Mumbai-based AIDS research and control centre says, “infected housewives and children are a clear indication of just how much the AIDS virus has advanced in India. He estimated that one out of 10 HIV patients is a housewife. In our country, the first HIV patient was detected in 1989. Till the end of 1996, the country registered just 79 HIV positive cases, officially known, out of which 15 were female. It was officially known from Health Ministry sources that 82 AIDS- infected persons died last year and the number of deaths so far recorded was 472 in the country. However, UNAIDS estimates that the number of people living with HIV in the country may be as high as 12,000. Although still considered to be a low prevalence country, Bangladesh remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic, given its overpopulation, dire poverty, gender inequality and high level of multiple sexual relationships. UNAIDS estimates that without any intervention the prevalence in the general adult population could be as high as 8% by 2025. Social researchers grimly say, “In our country with all the economic problems- rising unemployment and drug abuse, only AIDS was missing. Now we, too have not been spared. If the number continues to rise, it will be especially ominous for the country, since the country does not have medical facilities, physicians or drugs to adequately treat the disease. Noticeably, in the United States, it took more than a decade of massive public education and millions of dollars in research before the appalling number of HIV cases finally stabilized. Speaking about Bangladesh, the country today is so economically weak that it cant even treat the scourge of prevalent disease like diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis etc., let alone fund its anti-AIDS effort. “It is, as if, were standing on the beach, watching a giant wave coming right at us”, says one medical expert in the country. “We know it, we see it, and we can do almost nothing about it. We are just going to be swept away”. In our country what we have to be careful is about the possibility of transmission of this deadly scourge through “heterosexual” chains. At least in India as well as our country, that mode accounts for almost two thirds of almost all HIV positive cases. In India as well as in our country, promiscuity is the single most important way by which this scourge has the possibility of spreading. People must know its incubation period, that keeps the virus hidden for a long time and after a certain time it explodes in a virulent form almost as an epidemic. The most potent reason for its rapid transmission is because the symptoms take an average of five years to show up. So an infected person can pass the virus unknowingly to scores of people. This is unlike other sexually transmitted diseases where the symptoms appear in the first few weeks or months of infection itself and the other reason is that middle class never believed that they wee vulnerable to the insidious culprit. Shockingly, the old concept s of societal ethos, mores and morality seem to be breaking down. Most revealing, a recently released research data conducted by a West Indian based Institute on the sexual mores of middle class and upper class Indians reveals that of the 16,154 persons surveyed as many as 43 per cent of them admitted to having had pre-marital sex. Among those who were married, one out of five people said they had extra-marital relations. Most of these people in these groups did not use condoms while having sex since they did never comprehend that such behaviour exposed them to sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS. Experts attribute this shift in sexual behaviour of the middle or lower class of working people as changes in the work place as a major cause. Lack of housing facilities in the work place has spawned a breed of workers who spend half their working lives away from home. At the same time women have become an increasingly visible part in many places away from their homes. All these factors taken together, one can only see the settings for an increasing number of casual sex relationships. Till recently, many people in our country considered AIDS a scourge of the libertine West that posed no threat to a conservative society like ours based on monogamous marriages. Bangladesh, these days, has hundreds of thousands of sailors, construction workers and other professional groups who work abroad for a time and a continual tide of students and business men returning from overseas. The virus has either spread or is likely to spread from returnees carrying this insidious infection because they were not tested on their arrival. Most people in the country and the government prefer to ignore it. Unsurprisingly, the first AIDS case surfaced in the country in 1989 –the carrier being a returnee from abroad. Social scientists point out that the growing affluence of a certain class of people and the influence of movies have something to do with the changing moral values. And without contradiction, one can say that the influence of the West is not an escapable factor. Shockingly, we have borrowed the gloss but not the ability to fight a crisis. While in the West, maintaining multiple sexual relationship is now considered a “high risk” behaviour, in our country it has become just a symbol of liberation. At the same time, women are shedding their inhibitions and sexual ambitions of both the groups are running high. In the face of the impending AIDS threat that is likely to jolt the country by the end of the year 2025, as UNAIDS predict as the tide of migrant workers returning home continues to increase, the government from now on, will have to launch an intensive programme to halt the spread of the disease with some practical steps. Health ministry must ensure that hospitals and clinics conduct safe blood transfusion of patients and think seriously about screening those who they thought might be using drugs –focusing mainly on unemployed young men and IV drug users. Lastly, both the administration and people must contend with the fact that AIDS is no longer a medical problem, it is a social problem. And the startling rise in the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases, health officials contend, is an early warning about the spread of the dreadful AIDS. The National AIDS surveillance programme unveiled in 1997 has done a pretty good job by promoting safe blood supply, rational use of blood and blood products through screening, provision of care and support systems and amendment of laws to prevent discrimination of people living with HIV/AIDS. In most of the countries of the world, the AIDS virus has spread beyond the most vulnerable groups and into the societys mainstream. It robs economies of the workers, families of their support and children of their parents. The writer is a columnist of The Daily Star.

New vaccine helps prevent HIV infection,,,2009-09-24,The Daily Star,"For the first time, an experimental vaccine has prevented infection with the AIDS virus, a watershed event in the deadly epidemic and a surprising result. Recent failures led many scientists to think such a vaccine might never be possible. The vaccine cut the risk of becoming infected with HIV by more than 31 percent in the worlds largest AIDS vaccine trial of more than 16,000 volunteers in Thailand, researchers announced Thursday in Bangkok. Even though the benefit is modest, ""its the first evidence that we could have a safe and effective preventive vaccine,"" Col. Jerome Kim said in a telephone interview. He helped lead the study for the US Army, which sponsored it with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The institutes director, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned that this is ""not the end of the road,"" but said he was surprised and very pleased by the outcome. ""It gives me cautious optimism about the possibility of improving this result"" and developing a more effective AIDS vaccine, Fauci said in a telephone interview. ""This is something that we can do."" Even a marginally helpful vaccine could have a big impact. Every day, 7,500 people worldwide are newly infected with HIV; 2 million died of AIDS in 2007, the UN agency UNAIDS estimates. ""Today marks an historic milestone,"" said Mitchell Warren, executive director of the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, an international group that has worked toward developing a vaccine. ""It will take time and resources to fully analyse and understand the data, but there is little doubt that this finding will energise and redirect the AIDS vaccine field,"" he said in a statement. The Thailand Ministry of Public Health conducted the study, which used strains of HIV common in Thailand. Whether such a vaccine would work against other strains in the US, Africa or elsewhere in the world is unknown, scientists stressed. ""This is a scientific breakthrough,"" Thai Health Minister Witthaya Kaewparadai told a news conference in Bangkok. ""For the first time ever there is evidence that HIV vaccine has preventative efficacy."" The study actually tested a two-vaccine combo in a ""prime-boost"" approach, where the first one primes the immune system to attack HIV and the second one strengthens the response. They are ALVAC, from Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine division of French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis; and AIDSVAX, originally developed by VaxGen Inc. and now held by Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases, a nonprofit founded by some former VaxGen employees. ALVAC uses canarypox, a bird virus altered so it cant cause human disease, to ferry synthetic versions of three HIV genes into the body. AIDSVAX contains a genetically engineered version of a protein on HIVs surface. The vaccines are not made from whole virus dead or alive and cannot cause HIV. Neither vaccine in the study prevented HIV infection when tested individually in earlier trials, and dozens of scientists had called the new one futile when it began in 2003. ""I really didnt have high hopes at all that we would see a positive result,"" Fauci confessed. The results proved the sceptics wrong. ""The combination is stronger than each of the individual members,"" said the Armys Kim, a physician who manages the Armys HIV vaccine programme. The study tested the combo in HIV-negative Thai men and women ages 18 to 30 at average risk of becoming infected. Half received four ""priming"" doses of ALVAC and two ""boost"" doses of AIDSVAX over six months. The others received dummy shots. No one knew who got what until the study ended. All were given condoms, counselling and treatment for any sexually transmitted infections, and were tested every six months for HIV. Any who became infected were given free treatment with antiviral medicines. Participants were followed for three years after vaccination ended. Results: New infections occurred in 51 of the 8,197 given vaccine and in 74 of the 8,198 who received dummy shots. That worked out to a 31 percent lower risk of infection for the vaccine group. The vaccine had no effect on levels of HIV in the blood of those who did become infected. That had been another goal of the study seeing whether the vaccine could limit damage to the immune system and help keep infected people from developing full-blown AIDS. That result is ""one of the most important and intriguing findings of this trial,"" Fauci said. It suggests that the signs scientists have been using to gauge whether a vaccine was actually giving protection may not be valid. ""It is conceivable that we havent even identified yet"" what really shows immunity, which is both ""important and humbling"" after decades of vaccine research, Fauci said. Details of the $105 million study will be given at a vaccine conference in Paris in October. This is the third big vaccine trial since 1983, when HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS. In 2007, Merck & Co. stopped a study of its experimental vaccine after seeing it did not prevent HIV infection. Later analysis suggested the vaccine might even raise the risk of infection in certain men. The vaccine itself did not cause infection. In 2003, AIDSVAX flunked two large trials the first late-stage tests of any AIDS vaccine at the time. It is unclear whether vaccine makers will seek to license the two-vaccine combo in Thailand. Before the trial began, the US Food and Drug Administration said other studies would be needed before the vaccine could be considered for US licensing. Also unclear is whether Thai volunteers who received dummy shots will now be offered the vaccine. Researchers had said they would do so if the vaccine showed clear benefit defined as reducing the risk of infection by at least 50 percent. Those issues, plus how to proceed with future studies, will be discussed among the governments, study sponsors and companies involved in the trial, Kim said. Scientists want to know how long will protection last, whether booster shots will be needed, and whether the vaccine helps prevent infection in gay men and injection drug users, since it was tested mostly in heterosexuals in the Thai trial. The study was done in Thailand because US Army scientists did pivotal research in that country when the AIDS epidemic emerged there, isolating virus strains and providing genetic information on them to vaccine makers. The Thai government also strongly supported the idea of doing the study.",{},"['prevent', 'infection', 'thai', 'helps', 'infected', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'scientists', 'thailand', 'aids', 'study', 'trial']","""It gives me cautious optimism about the possibility of improving this result"" and developing a more effective AIDS vaccine, Fauci said in a telephone interview.

"Lack of transparency, accountability obstacle to fighting HIV/AIDS",,,2008-05-25,The Daily Star,"Experts at a seminar yesterday said it becomes a challenge to bring transparency and accountability in the institutions working with HIV/AIDS in the country as little progress is seen in last few years. Though Bangladesh received $60 million from Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) for 2004-2012 to combat the disease and already $41 million has been spent, the progress is very insignificant, they said. The experts said this at a seminar titled Keep the Promise of Universal Access by 2010 at Dhaka Reporters Unity in the city. Asian Peoples Alliance for Combating HIV and AIDS (APACHA) Bangladesh chapter organised the seminar as part of expressing its solidarity with the Global AIDS Week of Action (18-24 May) 2008. They further said if proper utilisation of the fund cannot be ensured, the country would face tremendous problem in combating the disease as the fund would be reduced from 2010 and by this time the number of HIV-infected people would increase much. Still only 15 percent of the total HIV/AIDS patients have received anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment, whereas it could be made possible to provide treatment to 1076 patients easily from a portion of the fund received, said APACHA Bangladesh chapter convener Dr Halida Hanum Khondokar. She said, “It becomes a challenge to bring transparency and accountability in the institutions working with AIDS.” If AIDS prevalence is seen more than 5 percent in any specific community in the country, it is considered as epidemic. In Bangladesh, the rate of HIV prevalence among the injective drug users (IDUs) is more than 10 percent, which is a matter of great concern, she added. The experts said even the media campaign is also vague and lacks information regarding AIDS. Criticising the advertise titled Banchte hole jante hobe, they said the advertise does not give messages to common people on what should be known, how and where to get the information and what would be the measures regarding AIDS. The 2008 UNGASS Country Progress Report that is prepared to present in the UN General Assembly High Level Meeting on AIDS from June 10-11 is a very weak report and shows sluggish advancement in spite of receiving enough fund, they added. “The government did not prepare the report. Rather it was prepared by a foreign consultant by spending a huge amount of money,” said Prof Nazrul Islam of Department of Virology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. Criticising the Country Coordinating Mechanisms (CCM), the speakers said in Bangladesh CCM is heavily dominated by government officials and also lacks monitoring and evaluation systems. They recommended the government to improve participation of civil society and a transparent system to select the CCM members. The recommendations include minutes to be provided to all CCM members, sub-groups to plan and establish transparent monitoring systems and distinct roles to avoid conflict of interests and mechanisms to reflect Global Funds participation principles.

Deadly HIV-TB co-epidemic sweeps sub-Saharan Africa,,,2007-11-03,The Daily Star,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV have merged into a double-barreled epidemic that is sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa and threatening global efforts to eradicate both diseases, according to a report released yesterday. Over-burdened health systems are unable to cope with the epidemic and risk collapse, said the report, which calls for urgent measures to curb its spread. A third of the worlds 40 million HIV/AIDS sufferers also have TB, and the death rate for people infected with both is five times higher than that for tuberculosis alone. The situation is aggravated by surging rates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB precisely in those areas where the rates of HIV infection are highest. MDR and XDR tuberculosis are resistant to some or all of the standard drugs used to fight the disease. ""Now the eye of the storm is in sub-Saharan Africa, where half of new TB cases are HIV co-infected,"" said Veronica Miller, co-author of the report and director of The Forum for Collaborative HIV Research, which issued the study. ""Unlike bird flu, the global threat of HIV/TB is not hypothetical -- it is here now,"" she said. One third of the worlds population carries the tuberculosis bacterium, but the disease remains latent in nine out of 10. HIV, however, changes the equation: Of those whose immune systems have been compromised by HIV, 10 percent will develop active tuberculosis each year, according to the report. ""In todays world, a new TB infection occurs every second. When one considers that much of this transmission occurs in areas with high HIV prevalence, the imminent danger of a global co-epidemic is clear,"" said Diane Havlir, head of the World Health Organisations TB/HIV working group. TB control has been severely destabilised in regions with high rates of HIV, the study says. In one community of 13,000 people outside of Cape Town, South Africa, the TB patient case load increased six-fold between 1996 and 2004, the researchers reported. ""There has been a staggering increase in TB in this community, and this has been replicated right across southern Africa,"" Stephan Lawn, a medical researcher at the University of Cape Town, said in a statement. The report called for urgent coordinated action on the part of governments, researchers, drug companies and local communities. The measures called for include fast diagnostic tests to detect all forms of TB in HIV-infected adults and children; new methods to rapidly map HIV and TB hotspots; new screening tools to identify new cases of drug-resistant TB; and better equipment for field laboratories in the most affected areas. There are approximately nine million new cases of tuberculosis in the world every year, according to the WHO. In 2005, the disease killed 1.6 million people. At the same time, an estimated 40 million people are living with HIV, according to the UN and the WHO. There were 4.3 million new infections in 2006 with 2.8 million (65 percent) of these occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2006, 2.9 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses. In South Africa, HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of child mortality and accounts for 40 to 60 percent of all deaths nationwide, according to UNICEF.",{},"['sweeps', 'rates', 'according', 'million', 'hivtb', 'subsaharan', 'tb', 'hiv', 'report', 'world', 'coepidemic', 'tuberculosis', 'deadly', 'africa']","Drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV have merged into a double-barreled epidemic that is sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa and threatening global efforts to eradicate both diseases, according to a report released yesterday.

Drug cocktail boosts HIV survival by 13 years,,,2008-07-26,The Daily Star,"Anti-HIV drugs have slashed death rates among people with the AIDS virus by nearly 40 percent since combination therapy was introduced in 1996, boosting their life expectancy by some 13 years, a study says. It is the biggest-ever assessment into the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy -- the triple cocktail of drugs that suppress, but do not eradicate, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Publishing on Friday in the British weekly medical journal The Lancet, researchers report on 14 ongoing studies into more than 33,000 HIV-infected people living in Europe, Canada and the United States. These people started antiretrovirals in one of three phases -- from 1996-1999; from 2000-2002; and from 2003-2005. From 1996 to 2005, 2,056 patients died, but mortality fell by around 40 percent in the course of this period. Life expectancy at the start was 36.1 years but rose to 49.4 years at the end. ""These advances have transformed HIV from being a fatal disease, which was the reality for patients before the advent of combination treatment, into a long-term chronic condition,"" says the paper. The team is headed by Robert Hogg, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. The study found that people who were treated earlier after infection and had a higher number of CD4 immune cells at the start of the therapy had a better life expectancy. Despite the greater overall survival chances, there remained a big gap in life expectancy between people on antiretrovirals and the general population, the authors found. In a rich country, an HIV-positive person starting the drugs at the age of 20 will on average live another 43 years, to the age of 63, while a non-infected person will survive to around 80, according to this data. The mortality figures culled in the study are not detailed enough to explain this discrepancy, the authors admit. Nor -- given most people with HIV are under 50 - are there yet any figures to compare survival among older HIV-infected people compare with non-infected counterparts.",{},"['virus', 'boosts', 'drugs', 'expectancy', 'start', '13', 'therapy', 'hiv', 'life', 'drug', 'survival', 'person', 'cocktail', 'study', 'patients']","It is the biggest-ever assessment into the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy -- the triple cocktail of drugs that suppress, but do not eradicate, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

FDA approves first HIV test kit for home use,,,2012-07-07,The Daily Star,"After decades of controversy, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new HIV test very recently for the first time that makes it possible for people to learn in the privacy of their homes if they are infected. The availability of an HIV test as easy to use like a home-pregnancy kit is yet another step in the normalisation of a disease that was once seen as a mark of shame and a death sentence. About one person in 5,000 would get a false positive test, and about one person in 12 could get a false negative. Any positive test needs confirmation in a doctor’s office, the FDA pointed out and people engaged in high-risk sex should test themselves regularly. Getting an infected person onto antiretroviral (ARV) drugs lowers by as much as 96% the chance that s/he will transmit the virus to someone else, so testing and treatment have become crucial to prevention.

New approach against HIV ‘promising’,The first human trial of a new type of HIV therapy suggests it could be a promising weapon in the fight against the virus.,,2015-04-09,The Daily Star,"The first human trial of a new type of HIV therapy suggests it could be a promising weapon in the fight against the virus. Reports in the journal Nature show infusions of so-called broadly neutralising antibodies could suppress the amount of HIV in a patients blood. The approach uses clones of immune proteins taken from a rare individual who has natural control of the disease. Scientists hope with further work this could bolster current treatments. Profound effects People naturally mount a defence against the virus by producing an army of protein based weapons - antibodies. But in most cases these are not powerful enough to defeat it. The international research team harvested copies of unusually potent ones, capable of neutralising many different strains of HIV. Patients given the highest concentrations were able to fight the virus for some time, dampening the replication of HIV in their blood. The strength of this protection varied - in some it lasted more than four weeks. In the journal the authors said: ""Our data establish that passive infusion of single broadly neutralising antibodies can have profound effects on HIV viraemia in humans."" But because of the viruss ability to mutate rapidly, in some patients it was able to outwit the therapy by changing structure over time. To overcome this scientists suggest using this treatment alongside current drugs or together with other antibodies. Immune jolt Prof Michel Nussenzweig of the Rockefeller University in New York, told BBC News: ""This is different to treatment out there already on two counts. ""First because it comes from a human - so it is natural in that respect. ""And secondly it opens up the possibility of giving the patients own weakened immune system a jolt. ""One part of the antibody could act as a red flag - pointing out to the body where the virus is hiding and sending signals to kill it."" They are now exploring whether the infusion could shield people from getting the disease in the first place. But he cautioned that studies into the antibody are still small and at an early stage. ""We have shown the approach is safe and effective. ""What this trial is telling us is that it is now time to look at the possibilities - from prevention and treatment to even cure,"" he said. Commenting on the findings, Prof Vincent Piguet from Cardiff University, said: ""This exciting novel study shows for the first time that antibodies may have a place in the line of therapies directed against HIV."" He described it as an ""important development in the fight against HIV"" but said the costs of antibody therapy and the emergence of resistance must be taken into account.",{},"['virus', 'neutralising', 'promising', 'university', 'antibody', 'approach', 'therapy', 'hiv', 'treatment', 'fight', 'antibodies', 'patients']","The first human trial of a new type of HIV therapy suggests it could be a promising weapon in the fight against the virus.

End to Aids in sight,"HIV-suppressing medication can make the AIDS virus “untransmittable” even among couples who have sex without using condoms, new research showed yesterday.",,2019-05-04,The Daily Star,"HIV-suppressing medication can make the AIDS virus “untransmittable” even among couples who have sex without using condoms, new research showed yesterday.

Lack of political will key obstacle to preventing AIDS,,,2007-08-23,The Daily Star,"Lack of political will and commitment contributes significantly to stigmatising and ostracising the HIV-positive people, preventing the social cohesion required in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Experts, practitioners and donors made this comment at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific yesterday, being held in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo. At the conference, Bangladesh was reported to have the highest incidences of trafficked women who are highly vulnerable to HIV. ""The lack of political will and commitment to do something about HIV is a significant factor in contributing to stigma. If political and social leaders show no concern for HIV, then why should their people?"" asked Noerine Kaleeba, chair of Actionaids International Board, at the opening plenary session. ""By discussing HIV openly, sensitively and rationally, leaders can make people sit up and listen,"" she said. Otherwise, the people affected with HIV face a kind of social death whereby an individual or affected family are ostracised by the community and cannot access various services, she added. HIV/AIDS-related stigma is one of the key obstacles to accessing care for persons and families affected by this pandemic as many of them do not know their status either due to lack of facilities, lack of appropriate information or due to fear of stigma, Kaleeba said. Bangladesh has many suspected unreported cases because of social stigma in both rural and urban communities, she said. Deputy Executive Director of UNFP Purnima Mane told a plenary session, ""Going beyond the silence into action is the only way we can face the future generations knowing that we are doing our best to ensure an AIDS-free generation."" She emphasised the urgency for all countries to make universal access to sexual and reproductive health and to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support a priority. ""The greatest impact can be achieved when we link prevention with treatment and care,"" she said. A UN Development Programme study on Human Trafficking and HIV unveiled at the conference found that a large number of trafficked women in South Asia also run the risk of contracting HIV. ""The highest reported incidence of this double burden is in Nepal, Bangladesh and India."" The study identified gender inequality, violence and the lack of economic opportunities for women, especially young women, as major factors increasing their vulnerability to both trafficking and HIV. The study recommends better coordination in national efforts to integrate trafficking and HIV interventions into key sectors, and to create laws and policies regarding the two issues.",{},"['care', 'key', 'lack', 'women', 'social', 'obstacle', 'affected', 'hiv', 'trafficking', 'stigma', 'aids', 'preventing', 'study', 'political']","Lack of political will and commitment contributes significantly to stigmatising and ostracising the HIV-positive people, preventing the social cohesion required in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

A shield against AIDS,"""It's magic,"" says Francois, smiling. ""Every time I take a pill I think about the people who aren't so lucky as to have this option.""",,2017-12-01,The Daily Star,"""Its magic,"" said Francois, smiling. ""Every time I take a pill I think about the people who arent so lucky as to have this option."" Taking a drug normally prescribed to treat AIDS as a way to shield against the deadly disease -- known as PrEP -- is catching on, and proponents hope that it will soon have a measurable impact in reducing the number of infections. ""Besides its undeniable benefits for individuals, we need to know if PrEP confers a collective advantage too with a lower number of new cases,"" said French expert Jean-Michel Molina ahead of World Aids Day on Friday. There are nearly 20 million people around the world taking anti-retroviral therapy (ART) medication today, and another 17 million who need it. HIV has infected 76 million people, and killed 35 million. The idea behind PrEP -- pre-exposure prophylaxis -- is simple: high-risk persons who are HIV-negative take Truvada, normally prescribed to patients already infected, in order to prevent the virus from taking hold. Target groups are men who have sex with men, and heterosexual couples in which one person is HIV-positive. The World Health Organization has also recommended that sex workers adopt a PrEP regimen. The United States, in 2012, and France three years later were the first two countries to authorise this form of preventative treatment. Others have followed suit, including Canada, Kenya, Brazil, Thailand, Australia, Belgium, Scotland and South Africa, where 19 percent of the population live with HIV/AIDS. Seatbelts and airbags In France -- the first country in which PrEP has available without cost -- ""about five in 10,000 people"" should be taking it, said Molina. So far, there has been no measurable effect: in 2016, France saw 6,000 new infections, the same level as for the last ten years. ""The number of people who have started PrEP -- about 3,000 -- is probably not enough to have had a statistical impact,"" Frances public health watchdog agency concluded recently. Prep can be taken regularly (one pill a day), or ""as needed"" before and after sexual encounters. But treatment protocols must be scrupulously respected to ensure protection. ""We dont yet have a vaccine against AIDS, but PrEP is a new and effective form of prevention alongside condoms,"" said Molina, who leads the ongoing Ipergay study for Frances AIDS Research Agency. Francois, 55, is gay and lives in Paris. He has been on PrEP for 18 months. ""The sword hanging over my head has vanished,"" he said in an interview. ""The day one forgets a condom or it breaks, I no longer have that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach."" In France, ""PrEPers"", as they are called, are required to have blood tests every three months, in part to scan for other sexually transmitted diseases not blocked by the treatment. PrEP is not without critics. The main objection is that it encourages risky behaviour, including sex without condoms. Generics ""It is important to protect against other STDs,"" said Molina. ""In a car, it better to use a seatbelt and have an airbag too."" Francois says he ""uses condoms with strangers,"" but not with regular partners. ""PrEPers who dont use condoms at all probably didnt use them before either,"" he speculated. Coverage of PrEPs cost under public health insurance has also been criticised as tantamount to subsidising reckless sex. ""A doctor shouldnt pass judgment, but rather protect health,"" retorted Molina. ""If PrEP helps to avoid infection, it has to be offered to patients."" Besides, he added, taking the drug preventively cost less in the long run than treating HIV-positive patients for life. The European patent for Truvada, made by US firm Gilead, expired at the end of July, bringing generics onto the market. As a result, the average price of treatment has dropped from 500 to 180 euros ($600 to $210). PrEP is prescribed in Germany, but is not reimbursed. In England, health officials have recently recruited 10,000 volunteers for a three-year study to gauge it effectiveness. ""PrEP alone will not stem the epidemic,"" said Molina. ""The three-pronged approach needed remains the same: treatment of HIV-positive patients, frequent testing of high-risk populations, and prevention, via condoms and now, PrEP.""",{},"['taking', 'france', 'health', 'prep', 'molina', 'shield', 'world', 'sex', 'aids', 'treatment', 'condoms']","Taking a drug normally prescribed to treat AIDS as a way to shield against the deadly disease -- known as PrEP -- is catching on, and proponents hope that it will soon have a measurable impact in reducing the number of infections.

AIDS: Epidemic bell ringing,,,2007-10-28,The Daily Star,"The battle against AIDS has taken in many directions over the last three decades. HIV infection continues to grow rapidly among high risk groups and there is concerning evidence of increasing new HIV infection rate despite prevalence rate said to remain low. Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries in the Asia-Pacific region where HIV/AIDS infections are rising. It was revealed at the recent 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP8) in Colombo 2007. This report gives us real cause for concern. Experts are predicting that the AIDS pandemic could be set to explode in the country. They identified political instability, human trafficking into prostitution, stigmatisation of those infected, conservative social attitudes and most importantly intravenous drug use as the key obstacles in the fight against the spread of HIV and make our people more vulnerable to HIV infection. “In our country, HIV has turned into a concentrated epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs). Spreading of HIV at a rate of 5 per cent among the high-risk groups is considered as concentrated epidemic. In 2000 the rate of HIV infection among IDUs was 1.4 per cent, in 2004 it raised to 4.9 per cent and in 2006 it reached to7.1 percent”, said Dr Yasmin Jahan, a consultant of the National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP). “Ironically the IDUs are the very people who supply blood for transfusions, thus fuelling the risk of spread to the generalised population. The trend illustrates a risky growth which needs strong intervention without undue prolongation,"" she added. “All sorts of high risk behaviour such as sharing of needles and syringes, resorting to drug use through injection, multiple sex partners and having commercial sex are prevalent among IDUs and make them the most vulnerable to spread infection. Current intervention programmes for the IDUs provided by different organisations can rehabilitate only a few portion of the 4.6 million IDUs in the country. This programme should be boost up immediately”, Dr Yasmin pointed out. According to the government statistics, a cumulative total of 874 cases of HIV/AIDS has been confirmed and reported as of 31st December 2006. A total of 240 AIDS cases were detected so far of which 109 had already died. Government agencies estimate that nearly 7,500 people are infected by HIV/AIDS. However, World Bank figures that nearly 12,000 people are affected by HIV in Bangladesh, with around 700 deaths in the past year. A government survey found that out of 216 new HIV positive cases identified in 2006, unemployed people were on top of the list at 39.35 per cent followed by housewives at 21.29 per cent and businessmen at 10.18 per cent. The data shows that unemployment is also causing spread of HIV/AIDS. ""All the statistics regarding HIV are based on high risk population. Nobody knows the actual condition of HIV infection among general population, as we have no data. The continued focus on high-risk groups has created a false sense of security and complacency in the general population including policy makers. Bangladesh has many suspected unreported cases because of social stigma in both rural and urban communities. Many people living with HIV/AIDS are unwilling to be tested and even though there are private and public laboratories carrying out HIV testing. Among the high-risk groups HIV testing is also challenging as they have their right to give consent and nothing should not be done against their will to protect their right. The daunting epidemic burden and momentum, however may be masked by the large population leading to low reported prevalence, which has resulted in considerable complications among government and developmental stakeholders. This is a key challenge fighting HIV/AIDS”, expressed Dr Mozammel Hoque, an HIV adviser of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC). “Another major concern in the region, in the context of HIV/AIDS, is the large scale of movement of people within and across national borders and trafficking of women and children. Bangladesh has been reported as one of the top countries having the highest incidences of trafficked women who are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. This sector remains relatively under focused and there is no strong measure to curb trafficking. Many countries require people to get mandatory testing for HIV infection before travelling but for those returning from countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence have no arrangement for voluntary counseling which is badly required in present situation. There is evidence of high rates of HIV transmission to wives from their husbands after their return from abroad”, he added. Lack of proper knowledge and risky sexual behaviour on HIV/AIDS facilitates the deadly virus to spread at an alarming rate. According to the existing data on knowledge and behaviour, only 17 per cent of the most-at-risk populations have correct knowledge about prevention and most people misconceptions on HIV/AIDS. A survey among adolescents and young people (15-24 years) in 2005 revealed that only one out of three males in urban and one out of four in rural areas had correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Nearly 59 per cent of married women and 42 per cent of men of age 15-54 group have no idea as how to avoid HIV. Statistics on commercial sex workers also shows that although these women have every intention of using condom and understand the risk of not protecting themselves. In most cases it was found that their clients refused to use condoms. Rakhi, (not a real name) a sex worker from a city suburb says, “Most of my clients do not enjoy sex with a condom. Since they are buying sex, they rule the business”. Many experts point out that a decade ago, India had almost the same low level status but it now has an uncontrollable epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The Indian government was initially in denial voice regarding the fact that India could have so many people living with HIV/AIDS. Experts doubt that Bangladesh may not remain as low prevalent country for long. We should get prepared to take action now.",{},"['ringing', 'infection', 'spread', 'rate', 'hivaids', 'idus', 'hiv', 'bell', 'sex', 'aids', 'risk', 'cent', 'population', 'epidemic']","HIV infection continues to grow rapidly among high risk groups and there is concerning evidence of increasing new HIV infection rate despite prevalence rate said to remain low.

Progress card of Bangladesh,,,2014-07-27,The Daily Star,"Findings of a study co-authored by icddr,b scientist Dr Aliya Naheed and recently published in the prestigious journal The Lancet reveal that, fewer people are dying from TB and malaria in Bangladesh, and at the same time, more Bangladeshis are being infected with and dying from HIV/AIDS than in the past. Published in The Lancet on July 22, the study — Global, regional and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 was conducted by an international consortium of researchers led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The new estimates show that worldwide, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria kill fewer people than they have in the past, and declines in new cases and deaths from these diseases have accelerated since 2000. Worldwide, deaths from HIV/AIDS declined at a rate of 1.5% between 2000 and 2013, while tuberculosis declined at a rate of 3.7% over the same period. In contrast to global trends, the study further reveals that deaths from HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh increased by a rate of 1.9% between 2000 and 2013. Deaths from TB and malaria have fallen at a faster rate than the global average at 6.7% (compared to 3.7% globally) and 11.1% (compared to 3.1% globally), respectively, between 2000 and 2013. Dr. Aliya Naheed, Associate Scientist with icddr,b’s Centre for Equity and Health Systems said, “Bangladesh has worked hard to improve the diagnosis and treatment of TB. We’ve also invested in malaria control efforts, and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria provided important support for our national malaria program since 2007. Now we need to prioritise our growing challenge with HIV/AIDS”. The researchers also found that there were a total of 204 TB cases per 100,000 people in Bangladesh in 2013, and 193 new cases of TB per 100,000 were diagnosed that year. By comparison, there were 7 cases of HIV/AIDS per 100,000 in Bangladesh in 2013, and less than 1 new infection per 100,000 for that year. Furthermore, new cases of HIV/AIDS and deaths from the disease primarily occurred in males. In 2013, there were 390 deaths from HIV/AIDS in males compared to 181 in females. TB deaths and new infections in Bangladesh were also largely concentrated in males; total TB deaths last year involved 12,257 males compared to 3,288 females. Similarly, new cases and deaths from HIV and tuberculosis are more common in males at the global level. The study also assessed trends in annual malaria cases and deaths throughout the world. From 2000 to 2013, Bangladesh had a large decline in malaria deaths, dropping from 114 in 2000 to 32 in 2013. The Millennium Declaration in 2000 brought special global attention to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria through the formulation of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6. The Global Burden of Disease 2013 study provides a consistent and comprehensive approach to disease estimation for between 1990 and 2013, and an opportunity to assess whether accelerated progress has occurred since the Millennium Declaration.",{},"['deaths', 'cases', '2000', 'hivaids', 'global', 'card', 'malaria', 'progress', 'tuberculosis', 'study', 'tb', 'bangladesh']","In contrast to global trends, the study further reveals that deaths from HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh increased by a rate of 1.9% between 2000 and 2013.

Time for anti-AIDS steps: Nafis Sadik,,,2003-01-16,The Daily Star,"Dr Nafis Sadik, special envoy of the UN secretary-general, said Bangladesh needs timely investment in preventive measures to maintain low HIV and AIDS prevalence. She was speaking at a press conference yesterday in the city. She noted that despite low prevalence of HIV /AIDS, less than one per cent among sex workers, Bangladesh is a high-risk country for many reasons. The population age structure is extremely vulnerable to HIV, she said. There are thirty million people below the age of twenty years, and there is evidence that young people are experimenting with commercial sex and multiple partners. Yet, it is generally believed that only a few segments of the population are at risk of HIV, she added. Moreover, the low level of knowledge of the general population makes it difficult to create awareness about AIDS. Only 19 per cent of ever-married women and 33 per cent of currently married men had heard of AIDS. High infection rates among the drug users and unsafe blood transfusion are among the basic modes of HIV transmission, she added. Dr Sadik pointed out that a large number of Bangladeshi citizens are vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, since they are working as peacekeepers in many countries with a high HIV prevalence rate. Also the close proximity to India, Myanmar and Thailand and the associated migration between them, make Bangladesh vulnerable to an HIV epidemic, she added. Proper measures should be adopted to prevent prevalence of HIV, considering the risk factors. Education on reproductive health, culture and religion can reduce the risk, she said. ""People infected with HIV do not come forward to seek help since they think they will be stigmatised,"" said Dr. Sadik. ""It is society that should extend help to the victims by not condemning them."" She also stressed the need for rehabilitating the HIV infected people.",{},"['steps', 'vulnerable', 'hiv', 'risk', 'antiaids', 'low', 'aids', 'prevalence', 'nafis', 'cent', 'population', 'sadik', 'bangladesh']","Dr Nafis Sadik, special envoy of the UN secretary-general, said Bangladesh needs timely investment in preventive measures to maintain low HIV and AIDS prevalence.

AIDS: Concern for Bangladesh,,,2008-05-31,The Daily Star,"Bangladesh, with a population of over 140 million, is surrounded by India, and Myanmar, where the number of HIV positive cases has been growing at a high rate. Bangladesh is considered fortunate to be low-prevalent, but South-East Asia has the second highest incidence of HIV in the world after Sub-Saharan Africa. The HIV burden in the region is concentrated in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand, which, indeed, is a matter of concern for us. In this context, it needs to be recalled here that no HIV case was detected in the country up to June, 1988, according to London-based Panos Institutes ""AIDS and the Third World."" Afghanistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and Maldives are other Asian countries with no HIV cases up to June, 1988. Sounding a note of caution, the Panos said that the greatest risk to Bangladesh was from ""visiting sailors and soldiers."" Along with these, some of the countrys 40 million expatriate workers are seen as another risk factor today. The other day (27 May) there was a case report in a section of the press (BSS/The Independent) that a Bangladeshi worker was affected by HIV through unsafe blood transfusion in Malaysia and in non leading a secluded life in the country almost without any family and social cooperation. Dirty syringes are also described as a problem, since they also transmit other diseases like Hepatitis B. Sex is seen as the least important factor in Bangladesh because of our moral, spiritual and other attitudes. But with the passage of time there have, however, been some changes in attitudes and values in our country also. The number of reported HIV cases in Bangladesh till December last year was 1,207, while the number of AIDS cases was 365, according to official estimates. The number of deaths from AIDS in the country is 123 so far, while there are an estimated 1,500 HIV cases, according to official sources. Unofficial estimates would, however, put such figures much higher. What has been haunting those working in the field is that in a conservative Muslim majority country nearly 1,500 HIV positive cases have been reported, while there were none two decades ago. WHO has been providing technical and logistical support to Bangladesh to scale-up prevention, care, treatment and support to the people living with HIV/AIDS. About 2.5 million people have been afflicted with HIV in India, 339,000 in Myanmar, 193,000 in Indonesia, 70,000 in Nepal, and 541,000 in Thailand. Worldwide, over 5,700 persons die from the killer disease every day, mostly because of inadequate access to HIV prevention and treatment services. About 60 million people have been infected, and AIDS has already claimed more than 25 million lives. Of the estimated 33.2 million people with HIV in the world in 2007, about 7.2 million live in the South-East Asia region, which indeed is alarming. The awareness of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh still remains quite low. ""Only 19 percent of married women and 33 percent of married men had heard of AIDS,"" revealed a survey conducted about five years ago. WHO considers creating awareness on HIV/AIDS as a priority intervention at school level. Dr. Hanif Uddin, Deputy Programme Manager, National AIDS/STD Programme was of the opinion that todays scenario regarding awareness in the countrys married men and women would be between 50-60 percent. A survey is being conducted on the prevailing situation. According to Dr. Kamruzzaman Biswas, National Programme Officer, WHO: ""Family life education in Bangladesh is still in its infancy. As a first step, the WHO is supporting the National STD/AIDS Programme to orientate teachers on HIV/AIDS."" Dr. Kamruzzaman said: ""The majority of parents in Bangladesh are not at ease talking about sexuality and HIV/AIDS with their children. At the same time, teachers still do not feel comfortable about talking on these issues. But, in reality, students have a lot of questions in their minds related to the physiological and emotional changes during adolescence. They can get wrong information from their friends if parents and teachers fail. As education about HIV/AIDS has not gained the desired momentum through the formal education system, WHO is supporting awareness programmes for students."" Blood safety is one of the priority issues for prevention of HIV/AIDS, especially in Bangladesh, as professional donors still remain the major source of blood supply. Meanwhile, Bangladesh, with WHO, has taken up a project to prevent HIV infection in young people aged 15-24 . The activities covered in the proposal include providing HIV prevention information to young people through mass media, life skills education through youth organisations and clubs, integration of HIV prevention into secondary schools and higher secondary curriculum, and making health services more youth friendly. Dr. Kamruzzaman said: ""A social marketing programme for condoms targeted to young people will be introduced in 64 districts. Advocacy and sensitisation programmes will target religious and community leaders, parents, and policy makers. The proposal will also cover the much-needed research to generate the strategic information that is required to respond to the epidemic."" As there is no cure for AIDS, it is hoped that the government will take all necessary steps to create awareness among the people at all levels so that all the people become familiar with the killer disease. Bangladesh, with its limited resources, cannot provide all the facilities required for AIDS patients. Today, a variety of treatments that can delay the progression of the disease for many years are available, and they can improve the quality of life of those who have developed symptoms. The government should do its best to make such facilities available to those who need them.

Leveraging HIV/AIDS and NCDs for strengthened chronic care systems,,,2011-12-01,The Daily Star,"Even though HIV/AIDS remains the main cause of adult death in sub-Saharan countries, concentrated epidemic is being observed in Asian countries among the most at risk people like injected drug users. The burden of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCD) in such countries is also high and growing rapidly. This phenomenon is not something new, however, regrettably, most developing countries face the new challenges of NCD at the same time as the challenges of communicable diseases and threats to maternal and child health. This burden of two kinds of diseases -- both needing constant care -- is putting extra pressure on the health care system of these countries, which are already having hard time in providing the integrated and coordinated services required to address chronic care. Therefore, very few persons living with NCDs and HIV in resource-limited settings have access to appropriate health services, leading to deferred diagnosis and unnecessary death and disability. Global guidelines and conceptual frameworks for NCD programmes are available for integrated and unified activities. However, very few developing countries have national NCD programmes providing nationwide activities for NCD prevention, care, and treatment services. Because of this, the health systems in resource-limited settings are hardly able to deliver continuous services of any kind and typically provide only short-term care for acute symptoms or problems. Even though HIV and NCD are thought of as quite different challenges, both these diseases need constant care systems. Fortunately, due to the availability of global funds in the health systems throughout the developing countries, tools and approaches needed to support continuous care in the local context have been developed. These models and approaches can be used for tackling NCDs as well. However, it goes without saying that the lessons of HIV care will not be always suitable for all NCD programmes or in all contexts. However, rather than ""reinventing the wheel,"" resource poor countries may be able jump-start NCD programmes by adapting locally owned and locally validated approaches initially developed to support HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. One of the success stories of HIV programmes is leading to a remarkable expansion of HIV treatment, reaching 6.6 million people compared with half a million 10 years ago. This is a lesson that the NCD programmes can learn. At a global, or ""upstream,"" level, NCD experts have developed multi-sectoral partnerships inclusive of civil society and achieved a high-visibility platform in the United Nations meeting. But the key question is the same for both, should there be a global fund for NCD or should advocates press instead for NCD services to be included in primary health care programmes and for efforts to strengthen broader health systems? In both the cases, key lessons from HIV programmes include the influence of unambiguous conscription targets to leverage resources and promote accountability; the value of engaging civil society and recipients of services to improve programme quality and adequacy; the need for novel financing schemes; the importance of leveraging the private sector; the multiple challenges of primary prevention; the importance of access to diagnosis, care, and treatment; and the power of a rights-based framework. On the other hand the ""downstream"" resources include key tools, and on the ground strategies and systems developed to support the implementation of HIV programmes that could be tailored to support programmes and services for NCD. However, we have to keep in our mind that the magnitude of NCDs is much higher than HIV in many countries, therefore NCDs need more decentralised activities embedded at community and primary care levels. One way of leveraging these two challenges of the decade is to compile a ""package of care"" for each level of the health system, including features like the use of standardised step-by-step diagnosis, care, and treatment protocols; the promotion of simplified point-of-service diagnostic testing; the use of simple and powerful indicators for monitoring and evaluation; and the development of enrollment targets at facility, locality and national levels. Paradigms of systems used by HIV programmes that could be stretched or ""cloned"" for use in NCD initiatives include decentralised community-based diagnostic testing; appointment and defaulter tracking systems; laboratory networks and referral systems; task-shifting and task-sharing approaches; clinical mentoring and supportive supervision; and the systematic use of peer educators. However, not all of these will be applicable to every NCD programme or in every context, but many valuable, practical, contextually appropriate and easily adapted resources could be used to jump-start service delivery. The most important aspect of this leveraging issue is that there are important differences between HIV and NCD that may limit the relevance of some of these resources. Both diabetes and HIV are diagnosed via laboratory testing and treated at some stages with daily medications; both require regular clinical and laboratory monitoring and support for adherence and behaviour change. In contrast, some cardiovascular diseases and cancers may be considerably harder to diagnose and treat at the health centre and community levels. Issues of stigma may shape programmes for HIV and mental health more than those designed for other NCDs. If significantly more resources become available, it might not be difficult to implement large-scale NCD programmes of any kind. It does not matter if the NCD initiatives are organised as ""vertical"" disease-specific or ""horizontal"" health systems-strengthening programmes, or as an amalgam. Addressing the burden of NCD in developing countries like Bangladesh requires an intensive, well-resourced multi-sectoral effort. And overlooking the potential of local HIV programmes to catalyse NCD service delivery would be a mistake. Leveraging the experience of HIV prevention, care, and treatment initiatives may take different forms. In some contexts, amalgamation of services for all chronic diseases -- HIV and NCD -- would be the best approach. In others, programmes might not get integrated at the point of service but may draw upon similar systems, from monitoring and evaluation to procurement. The take home message is that strengthening health systems to deliver continuous care is likely to enhance the performance of both HIV and NCD programmes, and should be top priority.

New WHO guidelines to end AIDS in Bangladesh,,,2013-11-08,The Daily Star,"BANGLADESHS swift and targeted response to HIV has had significant successes, but more must be done. Our approach must be united, vigilant and proactive. The new 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and UNAIDS Treatment 2015 initiative are an exciting leap forward that put our goals of “Zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths” in focus. The global experience with HIV and AIDS is that it is not a problem that will go away on its own, or that can be managed as a status-quo; we must aggressively pursue the vision of an HIV free Bangladesh -- and we must do this now. The new WHO guidelines recommend that anti-retroviral treatment (ART), comprising of medicines that can control the virus, begin when a patients CD4 cell count falls to 500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. CD4 cells are the white blood cells that HIV attacks, and is used as an indicator of any persons immune status once diagnosed as HIV positive, as these blood cells are responsible for maintaining a persons immunity. This is a significant change from the former guidelines, which recommended that ART begin when the CD4 cell count decreased to 350. Essentially, the new WHO guidelines recommend that people living with HIV receive treatment earlier, as recent evidence indicates that earlier ART will help people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives, and substantially reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. The current provision of ART services to people living with HIV in Bangladesh is commendable -- once people are identified as HIV positive with a CD4 count of 350 or lower, they usually receive the treatment and care that they need free of charge. The new WHO ART guidelines recommend that ART begin at CD4 count of 500, thus the number of people who require treatment in Bangladesh will increase remarkably, which presents a challenge. Bangladesh needs innovative solutions to strengthen outreach, testing, and counseling services; and to ensure that these are in the upazilas that need them. Achieving universal access to quality facilities and services will secure the future of the “Treatment as Prevention” paradigm; which requires provision of ART to all HIV-positive people, sero-discordant couples and pregnant women, regardless of CD4 count, in order to reduce the risk of further transmission. The HIV/AIDS programme, led by the government of Bangladesh and supported by UNAIDS, WHO, Unicef and UNFPA, has had considerable success thus far and the overall prevalence in the country has remained below 0.1%. The prevalence of HIV in people who inject drugs (PWID) in Dhaka was 7% in 2007 and 5.3% in 2011, so it seems to be contained; and HIV prevalence has remained low (within 0 to 2%) in other key populations such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and transgender persons. However, the demographics of Bangladesh present considerable challenges to the HIV prevention programme. Bangladesh is a densely populated country, with enduring poverty, low levels of education, gender inequality and high level of cross-border travel. As the AIDS epidemic changes shape, so must the HIV prevention programme. Improved surveillance and a national management information system (MIS) will be the cornerstones of this new phase of Treatment as Prevention. Doctors, laboratory technicians, nurses and counselors need to be deployed to scale up existing services where more work can be done; community members need to be mobilised to enhance care and support services; and additional resources need to be targeted at the source of new infection, such as at-risk migrant workers. Ultimately, we are united in our vision of a Bangladesh free of HIV and AIDS; the new WHO guidelines and scaling up of the Treatment as Prevention paradigm may be the future, based on country context and stakeholder consultations to take place as per WHO recommendations.

Raise awareness among youths to prevent HIV/AIDS,,,2009-02-09,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a programme yesterday underscored the need for raising awareness on HIV/AIDS among the young generation to prevent the deadly disease. Though the HIV prevalence is low in Bangladesh, the country it is still considered as a high-risk country, they said adding that the country would not be able to afford the cost if the disease spread epidemic. They also said HIV/AIDS is not only a big problem to the public health it is also big obstacle in the way of development. It is imperative to know and disseminate the correct information about the HIV/AIDS among young generation to prevent HIV infection. Matra, an advertisement firm, organised the programme titled Janar Angikar Jananor Angikar at a city hotel to present the progress and achievement of the project titled Prevention and control activities among the vulnerable and highly vulnerable young people. Save The Children, USA, with the financial assistance of Global Fund, is implementing the project as managing partner. The project is a part of the National AIDS/STD Programme. Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr AFM Ruhul Haque was present as the chief guest while Sheikh Altaf Ali, secretary of the health ministry, ATM Fazlul Karim, secretary of the information ministry, Prof Dr Shah Monir Hossain, director general of Directorate General of Health Services, Rajat Gupta, chair of Global Fund Board, and Kelland Stevenson, country representative of Save The Children, USA, also spoke at the programme. Dr AFM Ruhul Haque said though HIV prevalence is low in the country we need to study the percentage as the HIV prevalence is high in the neighbouring countries. Praising the initiative and the campaign, he said apart from preventive activities treatment of the HIV/AIDS positive patients needs to be ensured as well.

Hope for HIV patients,,,2013-07-05,The Daily Star,"Two men who became free of HIV infection after bone marrow transplants have stopped taking Aids drugs without any sign of the virus returning, according to scientists. Talk of a cure is premature, the doctors told the International Aids Society conference in Kuala Lumpur. But the news will raise hopes that progress can be made towards a treatment that will not only keep the virus at bay but eventually eradicate it. The two men, who had longstanding HIV infections, were given bone marrow transplants at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Womens Cancer Centre in Boston because they were suffering from cancers of the blood. Tests showed that as their own cells were replaced by cells from the bone marrow donor, the levels of virus in their blood steadily dropped to undetectable. One of the men stopped taking antiretroviral medication to suppress HIV almost four months ago and the other seven weeks ago. They still have no detectable HIV in their blood cells. ""While these results are exciting, they do not yet indicate that the men have been cured,"" said Timothy Henrich, from the division of infectious diseases at Brigham. ""Long-term follow up of at least one year will be required to understand the full impact of a bone marrow transplant on HIV persistence,"" he said, adding that the virus could still be present in an organ such as the brain or in the gastrointestinal tract. ""If the virus does return, it would suggest that these other sites are an important reservoir of infectious virus,"" Henrich said. Even if the virus does not reappear, bone marrow transplants are not feasible for everybody.

Spreading messages of HIV/AIDS to the disadvantaged,,,2009-03-07,The Daily Star,"One of the vital factors for preventing against HIV/AIDS is to spread proper message to large number of population. It is estimated that about 56 million illiterate people of the country are at great risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. Educating them to fight against HIV/AIDS is very challenging. How will such a large number of disadvantaged population will protect themselves from the deadly disease? Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) has designed an intervention targeting disadvantaged population. With the support from UNESCO, DAM has produced a package of user-friendly materials, brochures, leaflets and posters to make the message clear on HIV/AIDS prevention, disclosed its executive director M Ehsanur Rahman. He said that non-formal education (NFE) is an effective tool to prevent HIV/AIDS among millions of illiterate and semi-illiterate people. The materials may be used to impart essential HIV/AIDS education to them who have the right to know the fundamental facts about the disease, he said. Rahman has appealed to the government to use NFE programme as a mass strategy to prevent transmission of the deadly disease into general population. Usually, general people feel shy talking about the issue. NFE, because of its scope for informal interaction, can be a media to share messages of HIV/AIDS and ways of prevention, he said. The new package of strategies combines emphasis on life skill development and change in practices through participatory teaching-learning process and training to make informed decision. The objectives are to improve the quality of learning regarding life skills and HIV awareness for youth, to increase and enhance community support for HIV prevention activities and to increase the capacity of district and community level stakeholders to support HIV prevention activities. In the mean time, workshops were held in six divisions of the country to identify essential learning needs and effective modes of learning. In addition, training manual and video materials on HIV/AIDS from different organisations have been collected to develop a pool of resource materials. An analytical report has also been prepared. Based on this curriculum, moves are going on to develop an effective teachers training manual and ICT material. At present, through the Bureau of Non-formal Education of the government, a massive project titled Post Literacy and Continuing Education for Human development (PLCEHD) is being implemented in various districts. The HIV/AIDS education package can be optimally utilised through this project to reach a large number of participants to contribute to the immense possibilities of combating HIV/AIDS.",{},"['support', 'nfe', 'materials', 'number', 'package', 'spreading', 'hivaids', 'training', 'disadvantaged', 'population', 'messages', 'prevention', 'education']","One of the vital factors for preventing against HIV/AIDS is to spread proper message to large number of population.

"Amid turning tide, AIDS claimed 1 million lives in 2016: UN","AIDS claimed a million lives in 2016, almost half the 2005 toll that marked the peak of the deadly epidemic, says a UN report proclaiming ""the scales have tipped"".",,2017-07-20,The Daily Star,"AIDS claimed a million lives in 2016, almost half the 2005 toll that marked the peak of the deadly epidemic, said a UN report Thursday proclaiming ""the scales have tipped"". Not only are new HIV infections and deaths declining, but more people than ever are on life-saving treatment, according to data published ahead of an AIDS science conference opening in Paris on Sunday. ""In 2016, 19.5 million of the 36.7 million people living with HIV had access to treatment,"" said the UNAIDS global roundup. This marked the first time that more than half of infected people were receiving anti-retroviral treatment, which subdues the AIDS virus but does not kill it. ""AIDS-related deaths have fallen from 1.9 million in 2005 to one million in 2016,"" said the authors, adding that ""for the first time the scales have tipped."" The year 2016 saw 1.8 million new infections, almost half the record number of some 3.5 million in 1997, said the report. In total, 76.1 million people have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, since the epidemic started in the 1980s. Some 35 million have died. ""Communities and families are thriving as AIDS is being pushed back,"" said UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe. ""As we bring the epidemic under control, health outcomes are improving and nations are becoming stronger."" As yet, there is no HIV vaccine or cure, and infected people rely on lifelong anti-retroviral therapy to stop the virus replicating. Without treatment, HIV-infected people go on to develop AIDS, a syndrome that weakens the immune system and leaves the body exposed to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, and some types of cancer. Treatment carries side effects and is costly, but allows infected people to be healthier for longer. - More work to do - Most progress has been made in east and southern Africa, the region that was hardest hit by the epidemic and where many interventions were focused. Since 2010, AIDS-related deaths in the region declined by 42 percent. The region accounts for half the worlds infected population, with women and girls disproportionately affected at 60 percent. Sixty percent of all people who receive anti-retroviral therapy live in east and southern Africa which, along with west and central Europe and the Americas, is on target to meet the so-called 90-90-90 targets set by the UN, said the report. By 2020, states the plan, 90 percent of infected people must know their status, of whom 90 percent must be on treatment. In 90 percent of those, the virus will be ""suppressed"" by medicine to the extent that it cannot function or replicate. By 2016, 70 percent of infected people knew their status, said the new report. Of those, 77 percent were on treatment, and 82 percent had virus suppression. UNAIDS expressed concern about two regions with worsening AIDS trends: the Middle East-North Africa, and eastern Europe-central Asia. Both are areas marred by conflict and political uncertainty. New HIV infections rose by 60 percent in eastern Europe and central Asia, and deaths by almost a third from 2010 to 2016. In the Middle East and North Africa, the number of AIDS deaths increased by a fifth in the last six years. ""Globally, progress has been significant, but there is still more work to do,"" the authors said in a statement. ""Around 30 percent of people living with HIV still do not know their HIV status, 17.1 million people living with HIV do not have access to anti retroviral therapy, and more than half of all people living with HIV are not virally suppressed."" Of the total infected population, over two million were children younger than 15, said UNAIDS. Only 43 percent of them were on treatment. New infections among children almost halved from 300,000 in 2010 to 160,000 last year, said the report. This was partly due to more and more HIV-infected pregnant women -- 76 percent in 2016 -- having access to drugs blocking virus transmission to their offspring.",{},"['virus', 'tide', 'deaths', 'lives', 'claimed', 'million', 'infected', 'amid', 'hiv', 'half', 'turning', 'aids', 'infections', 'treatment', '2016']","AIDS claimed a million lives in 2016, almost half the 2005 toll that marked the peak of the deadly epidemic, said a UN report Thursday proclaiming ""the scales have tipped"".

Study finds anti-AIDS vaginal ring partially protects women,"Women who inserted a vaginal ring coated with an anti-AIDS drug once a month were partially protected against HIV infection, researchers said Monday as they released long-awaited results from two large studies in Africa.",,2016-02-23,The Daily Star,"Women who inserted a vaginal ring coated with an anti-AIDS drug once a month were partially protected against HIV infection, researchers said Monday as they released long-awaited results from two large studies in Africa. The ring proved safe although the protection was modest, reducing overall HIV infection by less than a third. Surprisingly, the ring worked far better in women 25 and older, leaving researchers wondering if the youngest women, who got little to no benefit, simply didnt use the device properly. Women make up more than half of the nearly 37 million people worldwide living with HIV, most of them in hard-hit Africa, and scientists have long sought tools to help them protect themselves when their partners wont use a condom. Despite questions the studies raise, the nonprofit International Partnership for Microbicides said it considered the results promising enough to seek appropriate regulatory approval for wider use in parts of Africa. ""You cant just say, Until something is perfect, were going to wait,"" said Dr. Zeda Rosenberg, founding chief executive officer of IPM. ""We have to give women options."" ""For a woman to have a prevention tool that she can control is an incredibly important goal,"" added Dr. Jared Baeten of the University of Washington, who led a National Institutes of Health-funded study of the ring. ""I want rings, pills and other strategies to be on the shelf for women so they can make choices for whats going to work for them."" Aside from condoms, HIV prevention tools include taking a daily anti-AIDS pill. That so-called ""pre-exposure prophylaxis"" isnt widely available in poor countries, and other attempts at HIV-blocking vaginal gels havent yet panned out. But the age disparity found in the vaginal ring studies is so puzzling that the NIH plans to consult with outside experts on next research steps. While women need a discreet form of HIV prevention, ""its going to be absolutely critical"" to determine if the younger women really didnt follow instructions, or if there was some biological difference, cautioned Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIHs National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Vaginal rings are sold in the U.S. for birth control, but the anti-AIDS version tested in Africa contained no contraception. Instead, it slowly oozes an experimental virus-blocking drug named dapivirine into the surrounding vaginal tissue. Women would replace the ring once a month, when it was time for another dose. Two studies involving more than 4,500 women in Africa are being presented at the Retrovirus Conference in Boston, comparing women who used the dapivirine ring with those given an identical-looking but drug-free version. It offered modest protection, reducing by 27 percent to 31 percent the participants overall risk of HIV. But closer inspection of the large NIH-funded ASPIRE study in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe turned up something odd. Ring users who were 25 and older were 61 percent less likely to be infected while those ages 18 to 21 essentially got no benefit, Baeten said. While the ring is designed to stay in place for an entire month before being replaced, there are signs the younger women didnt use it as regularly, said Baeten, whose results also were published online Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. He said women had to get comfortable with the how to use a device theyd never seen before, but those who used the ring continuously saw protection that continued throughout the 2½-year study. ""The ring must be used consistently to achieve protection,"" the IPMs Annalene Nel told reporters Monday as she discussed the second study, called the Ring Study. Conducted in South Africa and Uganda, that study likewise showed a trend toward greater protection for women over 21, she said. While that study isnt completed yet, the IPM said South African regulators asked researchers to switch all the remaining study participants to the dapivirine-coated ring rather than the placebo version. Early studies of those daily anti-AIDS pills also found less protection in younger people, who did better at sticking with the tablets only after their effectiveness was proven, said Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, which advocates for a range of HIV prevention tools. He said there is ""a global imperative"" to answer remaining questions about the ring.",{},"['partially', 'studies', 'women', 'finds', 'vaginal', 'ring', 'hiv', 'protects', 'antiaids', 'africa', 'study', 'prevention', 'protection']","Women who inserted a vaginal ring coated with an anti-AIDS drug once a month were partially protected against HIV infection, researchers said Monday as they released long-awaited results from two large studies in Africa.

The red ribbon,,,2007-12-02,The Daily Star,"The Red Ribbon is the global symbol for solidarity with HIV-positive people and those living with AIDS. World AIDS Day, observed December 1 each year, is dedicated to raising awareness about the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection. UNAIDS and the Who estimate that the total number of people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has reached its highest level. As of 2006, there were an estimated 40.3 million people living with HIV. AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. Despite recent, improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3.1 million lives in 2005, of which more than half a million were children. The concept of a World AIDS Day originated at the 1988 World Summit of Ministers of Health on Programs for AIDS Prevention. Since then, it has been taken up by governments, international organisations and charities around the world. Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted, and is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world, while HIV-2 is less easily transmitted and is largely confined to West Africa. Both forms of the virus are believed to have originated in West-Central Africa, and jumped species (zoonosis) from primates to humans. HIV/AIDS infection in Bangladesh, so far, is within fair limit, but is appreciatively wide open to increase owing to prevalence of certain behavioural patterns and risk factors. A Who report on Bangladesh still considers it a low HIV/AIDS prevalent country. The Who estimates there are 13,000 HIV-positive people in the country, and HIV prevalence among the adult population is less than 0.01 percent. The swift rise of HIV/AIDS has been marked among the high-risk groups, including sex workers and injecting-drug users (IDUs). For example, in a pocket of central Bangladesh, the HIV prevalence rate among the IDUs jumped from 1.4 percent to 8.9 per cent in a three-year period. According to the latest information available with the National AIDS/STD Program (NASP), 874 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed as of December 31, 2006. According to National HIV Surveillance findings, the rate of HIV infection among the street-based sex workers in central Bangladesh is higher than that of the sex workers in other parts of South Asia. The majority of brothel-based sex workers report having sex without using condoms with some of their clients. In central Bangladesh, 9.7 percent and in south-eastern Bangladesh 12 percent female sex workers have been found to be infected with syphilis. The high rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) confirms the low rate of condom use and the presence of other risky sexual behaviours that facilitate the spread of HIV infection. According to experts, the level of HIV infection among the IDUs poses a significant risk, as it can spread rapidly within the group and then, through their sexual partners and the latters clients, among the general population. Another major concern is the significant number of IDUs who sell their blood professionally. Bangladesh relies on professional blood sellers to meet most of the blood transfusion needs of its people. Lack of proper knowledge on HIV/AIDS is another high risk factor. Only 17 percent of the most-at-risk groups have correct knowledge about prevention of the disease, but most people have misconceptions about it. A baseline survey of adolescents and young people (15-24 years) in 2005 found that only one out of three males in urban and one out of four in rural areas had correct knowledge on HIV/AIDS. Nearly 59 percent of married women and 42 percent of men of the age group, 15-54, years have no idea about how to avoid HIV. Therefore, it is imperative to give priority to education, poverty alleviation, and regular media coverage for disseminating knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and to offer sex education to the adolescents and the young under an academic program, suggested Mohammad Shafiqur Rahman and Mohammad Lutfor Rahman, researchers at the Dhaka University Institute of Statistical Research and Training. Meanwhile, an initiative has been taken to develop a multi-sector response to HIV/AIDS. Strategic action plans of the NASP set forth specific guidelines on a range of HIV issues, including testing, care, blood safety, and preventive measures for youth, women, migrant workers, and commercial sex workers. The government also prepared a National Strategic Plan for combating HIV/AIDS for the period 2004-2010 under the guidance of the National AIDS Council and with the involvement and support of different stakeholders. Infectious Diseases Hospital at Mohakhali provides treatment to HIV/AIDS patients, who can also get services at discount from the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and the Armed Forces Pathology. The government also has established voluntary counselling and testing centres in every district and upazila. As many as 380 NGOs, AIDS service organisations, and civil society bodies have been implementing various programs/projects across the country to contain scourge.

Candidate AIDS vaccine passes key early test,The near 40-year quest for an AIDS vaccine received a hopeful boost yesterday when scientists announced that a trial drug triggered an immune response in humans and shielded monkeys from infection.,,2018-07-08,The Daily Star,"The near 40-year quest for an AIDS vaccine received a hopeful boost yesterday when scientists announced that a trial drug triggered an immune response in humans and shielded monkeys from infection. Shown to be safe in humans, the candidate vaccine has now advanced to the next phase of the pre-approval trial process, and will be tested in 2,600 women in southern Africa to see whether it prevents HIV infection. While the results so far have been encouraging, the research team and outside experts warn there are no guarantees it will actually work in the next trial phase dubbed HVTN705 or ""Imbokodo"" -- the isiZulu word for ""rock"". ""Although these data are promising, we need to remain cautious,"" study leader Dan Barouch, a Harvard Medical School professor, told AFP. Just because it protected two-thirds of monkeys in a lab trial doesnt mean the drug will protect humans, ""and thus we need to await the results of the... study before we know whether or not this vaccine will protect humans against HIV infection,"" he said. The results of the Imbokodo trial are expected in 2021/22. ""This is only the fifth HIV vaccine concept that will be tested for efficacy in humans in the 35+ year history of the global HIV epidemic,"" added Barouch. Only one so far, RV144, yielded some protection. RV144 was reported in 2009 to reduce the risk of HIV infection among 16,000 Thai volunteers by 31.2 percent -- deemed insufficient for the drug to be pursued. For the latest study, published in The Lancet medical journal, Barouch and a team tested the candidate drug on 393 healthy, HIV-free adults aged 18 to 50 in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States. The participants were randomly given one of seven vaccine combinations or a placebo ""dummy"" alternative. They received four shots each over 48 weeks.

What made them leave?,,,2014-07-27,The Daily Star,"The 200-year-old Kandapara brothel in Tangail town wears a deserted look following the eviction of about 600 hundred sex workers. Photo: Star Tangail municipal mayor Shahidur Rahman Khan Mukti has come up with a most intriguing theory explaining why more than 600 sex workers left the Kandapara brothel in a single night. If he is to be believed, these women left the brothel in the district because they decided to quit the work they have been doing for years. What motivated them all of a sudden into deciding, and collectively too, to go for a change of profession is not explained. At the level of the local residents, though, there is a different story. They assert that Shahidur and his men forced the sex workers out in order to grab the land of the brothel and its adjacent areas. Having been thus forcibly evicted on the night of July 12, these sex workers find themselves in double trouble -- they have nowhere to go and they have no income. Many have taken shelter on the streets of Tangail sadar. Others are working as floating sex workers. One of them is 25-year-old Punnyo (not her real name). She said she made the streets of Tangail sadar her home along with some 1500 brothel residents, including children, aged sex workers and middlemen. She claimed she was sold to a sex trader in Kandapara by her lover, who betrayed her trust, a few years ago. ""Inside the brothel, customers had to pay and I had some kind of guarantee of financial security. But now, heroin addicts assault me on the street, force me to have sex with them and leave without paying."" Akhteruzzaman, director of Population Service and Training Centre, an NGO implementing the health ministrys national HIV-AIDs prevention programme in 12 brothels of the country, said such unplanned eviction of the sex workers was fraught with great risks. ""We used to supply every active sex worker with condoms for free,"" he said. ""Sex workers are at risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). We used to give them two strong antibiotics every three months as per WHO and health ministrys guidelines."" Both the programmes have now been hampered, he said, adding: ""How can we locate them now?"" Akhteruzzaman cited a study by ICDDR, B that shows floating sex workers are at greater risk of HIV-AIDs and STDs than those in brothels. After the eviction, Punnyo and a group of about 150 other sex workers are constantly on the run in fear of retribution by local goons and those who drove them out. ""They are driving us away from this town,"" said Punnyo. She described how on Monday night someone posing as a customer contacted her and made a deal to buy her sex for Tk 30, about eight times less than she got in the brothel. As she went to the agreed place, the man beat her up and left. ""Im hungry. I dont have a place to live and I cant go back home,"" she said, ""I left the brothel at 9:00pm on Saturday night, without a penny. So unlike many sex workers who were a little well-off, I could not move to other brothels in Mymensingh or Jamalpur."" In fact, there is no way to go back to the Tangail brothel either. Visiting Kandapara on Wednesday, this correspondent found about 20 labourers knocking down the rooms built on over 300 decimals of land. Asked why they were doing it, they said the owners had sold the bricks of the rooms. Abdul Mannan, one of the owners living close to the brothel, said he owned 10 decimals of land and that he sold the bricks of his rooms. ""I am not going to rent this place to sex workers any more,"" he said, adding that nobody had forced him or other owners to knock down the structures. ""I will go to the mayor and seek his advice on how best the land can be used,"" he added. One sex worker, who claimed to have owned 11 rooms there, said, ""How can I sell anything? I am running for my life,"" she said. According to her, of the 357 decimals of land there 310 decimals belonged to 49 sex workers. But the municipal mayor, Shahidur, said most of the land was owned by 51 locals. ""One or two of the owners might have been sex workers but now they live in other neighbourhoods."" Talking to reporters on Tuesday, he caused fresh surprise when he said he was not aware that the sex workers had been evicted. But he admitted to The Daily Star that he was present at a meeting where members of a local mosque committee had spoken about demolishing the brothel. ""I am the chairman of the mosque committee. I was attending the regular monthly meeting, where a few people stood up and delivered speeches on the issue,"" he said. ""Their non-violent movement had been going on for long, and we did not realise anything like this would happen. And there is nothing to be done if someone willingly quits his profession."" The district administration is aware of the eviction and its consequences. Mahboob Hasan, deputy commissioner of Tangail, told members of the Sex Workers Network on Tuesday that he would look into their demand for a resettlement of the evicted sex workers. But the victims do not see much of hope. ""Do you think I can ever get back to my land?"" said a female owner who rented out about 20 rooms in the brothel. ""I was forced to sell the bricks of the rooms at a loss of 40 percent. If we had the courage to stand up against the eviction, we would not have left the 200-year-old brothel on a single night,"" she said, requesting anonymity.

India PM hails success in battle against HIV,,,2011-07-05,The Daily Star,"Indias Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday hailed the countrys success in slashing new HIV/AIDS infections by half in the past decade, but warned against complacency. ""Our HIV/AIDS programme can justifiably claim a measure of success,"" he told a conference in New Delhi discussing means to combat the disease. But he added that new Ministry of Health figures estimating that 2.4 million Indians are still living with HIV means ""there should be no room for complacency"". ""With the introduction of antiretroviral treatment, HIV has become a chronic but manageable health condition,"" Singh said. While Singh was praising government efforts to combat the virus, around 100 people living with HIV protested outside the ministry of health saying efforts were insufficient. Despite the significant drop in fresh cases, India still has the highest number of people living with HIV after South Africa and Nigeria. So-called ""first-line"" antiretroviral therapy (ART) -- a cocktail of drugs to slow the effects of the virus on the bodys immune system -- has been widely available and free of charge in Indias public health system since 2004. More expensive ""second-line"" ART is also free, although access to it is limited to just a few centres across the country. ""Indias testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS have increased their reach,"" Singh said. Now, Indian health workers are focusing on prevention of transmission from infected pregnant women to their newborn children, making it a ""priority area,"" Singh said. Indias AIDS control programme has reduced new HIV/AIDS infections by 50 percent in the last 10 years and mortality rates amongst those infected with HIV have also fallen, Singh noted. The health ministry said the number of new HIV infections in India has fallen to to 120,000 annually from 270,000 reported in 2000. Indian pharmaceutical companies have helped to drive down the cost of life-saving generic drugs to treat people with HIV in India and other developing countries. Singh said one of Indias key strategies has been to scale up preventive education campaigns among high-risk groups such as sex workers. Other high risk groups include men having sex with men, Indias health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said. ""We can track female sex workers but it is almost impossible to identify men having sex with men. We need to take the message to them to further stabilise the epidemic,"" Azad said separately at the conference.",{},"['health', 'men', 'india', 'hivaids', 'indias', 'hails', 'hiv', 'infections', 'living', 'success', 'singh', 'sex', 'battle', 'ministry']","India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday hailed the country's success in slashing new HIV/AIDS infections by half in the past decade, but warned against complacency.

,,,,,"AIDS The Epidemic of Ignorance By Prathama Komal Nabi You could be next. Yes, you could be the next victim of a merciless monster that has already taken 33 million lives. It could be you. Then again it could also be me. The statistics concerning HIV/AIDS are devastating and the reality even more gruesome. Since the first case diagnosed in 1980, HIV/AIDS(Human Immunodeficiency virus/Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome) has infected over 40 million people worldwide, killed 33 million and orphaned a staggering 14 million. The UN has been working relentlessly to turn the tables and bring down the numbers. In 1996 the UNAIDS was created to unite six global agencies in their response to HIV/AIDS, after recognizing the growing complexities of the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The basics of HIV/AIDS: AIDS is the disease that kills and HIV the disease-causing agent. HIV or the Human Immunodeficiency Virus infects or destroys vital cells of the bodys immune system called helper T-Lymphocytes or CD4 cells. Since these play an integral role in the bodys immune system, the destruction of these cells leads to the eventual failure of the immune system. This is when AIDS or Aquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome occurs. In numbers, if the body has less than 200 CD4 cells or if the percentage is below 14%, the person has AIDS. However, the time period varies outrageously from person to person. Some die within months of being infected while others go on to live healthy, normal lives. Being infected with HIV is not the same as having AIDS. After being infected with HIV as the bodys immune system slowly starts to wear away, the person contracts Opportunistic infections. The infections are termed as ""opportunistic"" because these would not have occurred if the bodys immune system was fully functional. Some opportunistic infections are: a. PCP(Pneumocytosis carinii pnuemonia), a lung infection; b. KS(Kaposis sarcoma), a skin cancer; c. CMV(Cytomegalovirus), an infection that usually affects the eye; d. Candida, a fungal infection No cure for AIDS has been found out yet. However, there are drugs that can slow down the HIV virus, and slow down the damage done to the immune system. The aids virus in action Transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS One of the main reasons for which HIV/AIDS is spreading like fire throughout the globe is ignorance of the real facts of its transmission and prevention. Some are confused, some have very vague ideas, while some dont even know about HIV/AIDS. Stigma and discrimination concerning the disease has further fuelled the cloud of unawareness enshrouding this disease. People are afraid to have any sort of communication with an infected person, because they think that they will be infected as well. Because of the contempt and rejection that society shows, often the infected persons are pushed into isolation and are deprived of the proper medical treatment. The following lists the ways HIV/AIDS is transmitted: a. Sharing needles, IV drugs with an infected person or being injured by contaminated needles or other sharp objects. b. Using contaminated skin piercing instruments like a tattoo needles, acupuncture needles, etc. c. Receiving blood transfusions from an infected person or infected products, transplant of an infected organ. d. Contact with broken skin i.e., exposure to blood through cuts or lesions. e. Transplacental transmission, meaning mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy or through breastfeeding. f. Intercourse or copulation with an infected person. Contrary to general misconception HIV/AIDS is not spread through contact, shared food, clothing, or shaking hands. As with all problems the solution lies in its root. Similarly, the prevention of HIV/AIDS is intertwined with its methods of transmission. The following precautions can help in restricting the spread of HIV/AIDS- Using sterilised needles and syringes during blood transfusion, tatooing, acupuncture, etc. Of course, for drug users the best prevention would be to stop using drugs. Taking necessary safety measures while helping someone who is bleeding. e.g. wearing gloves, face masks and protecting any cuts or opens sores on the skin. For those pregnant women infected with AIDS, a special drug AZT is administered during pregnancy and delivery, which reduces the risk of having a HIV-infected baby to 2% from a 25% high. The baby itself is also given AZT. Implementing proper protection during copulation. Practicing monogamy and abstinence. Aids affected children in Thailand A global crisis: Not a corner of this globe has been spared the wrath of this cataclysmic scourge. The numbers however vary from region to region. Africa: The African countries south of the Sahara, with the some of the best HIV surveillance systems in the world, estimates that the number of newly infected adults and children in Africa reached 3.5 million by the end of 2002. There are now 16 countries in Africa in which more than one-tenth of the adult population aged 15-24 is infected with HIV. Horrifying is the fact that in seven countries in the southern cone of the continent, at least one in five is living with the virus. This is the highest rate since the epidemic broke out, says the UN report. With a total of over 5 million infected people South Africa has the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world. Asia: The largest of the seven continents, Asia continues to struggle through this epidemic. UNAIDS estimates that 700,000 adults, 450,000 of them men became infected in South and South-East Asia during the course of the year 2001. Overall, as of end-2002, the region is estimated to have 6 million adults and children living with HIV/AIDS. Eastern Europe and Central Asia: In countries of the former Soviet Union, the HIV epidemic continues to be heavily concentrated in injecting drug users. A conservative estimate of the number of adults and children living with HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union is 1.2 million in the year 2002. Caribbean: HIV is ravaging the populations of several Caribbean island states. In fact, some of them have worse epidemics than any other country in the world outside sub-Saharan Africa. Haiti is the worst affected nation in the region. Overall, around 8%of adults in urban areas and 4% in rural areas are infected with the epidemic. Others, like the Dominican Republic, has one in every 40 infected with HIV/AIDS, while the adult prevalence rate in the Bahamas is over 3.5%. United Kingdom: An estimated 34,000 people are infected with HIV/AIDS. However, one in three do not even know that they have been infected. A threat close to home: AIDS and Bangladesh: Hovering over the danger line, Bangladesh stands at low prevalence with 13,000 infected individuals(UNAIDS report, 2001) of which 4% are among the IDU(Injectable Drug Users). Globally, reaching 5% in any high risk group is seen as an epidemic. To avoid an epidemic, the experts say, Bangladesh needs to work on prevention efforts on a national level, including increased efforts towards the distribution of knowledge, promotion of artificial protection, and even behavioural changes. World Aids Day 2003: Live And Let Live: World AIDS Day was first observed on December 1,1988, after an international summit of health ministers called for a new spirit of social tolerance and a greater exchange of information about HIV/AIDS. Observed annually on December 1st, World AIDS Day serves to strengthen global efforts to address the challenges of the AIDS epidemic, which is spreading throughout every region of the world. Every year a particular theme is chosen for the World Aids Day and this years theme is ""Stigma and Discrimination"" and the UNAIDSs slogan this year is ""Live and let live"". ""Freedom from discrimination is a fundamental human right founded on principles of natural justice that are universal and perpetual. The basic characteristics of human rights are that they inhere in individuals because they are human, and that they apply to people everywhere."" -- UNAIDS You can make a difference: Right this moment HIV/AIDS could be taking down its next victim. This is where you come in. You can help in saving a life. Its the little things we all do that add up to make a difference.

HIV spreads in concentrated epidemic form among IDUs,,,2007-09-07,The Daily Star,"Though HIV prevalence is less than one percent in the country, it has already spread as a concentrated epidemic form among the injection drug users (IDUs), said the speakers at a roundtable yesterday. They said it is a must to increase awareness along with behavioural change and promote the use of condom among the adults as part of AIDS prevention. The roundtable titled Vulnerability of AIDS and safe relationship was organised jointly by the Prothom Alo and UNFPA at Biam auditorium in the city. Terming the IDUs as most vulnerable group, Rebeka Sultana of UNFPA said around 57 percent of drug users have relationship with sex workers, who attend around 40 others in a week. So they pose immense threat to spreading AIDS, she said. Besides, as it has been found that some 42 percent of the IDUs are married, there is also the possibility of transmitting the disease to their wives, she added. Rebeka said as sexual intercourse is the main route of HIV transmission in South Asia, use of condom should be increased in the country. A study has revealed that 80 percent of AIDS infection takes place through sexual intercourse, she added. "" Though the demand for condom has increased, the supply is not at all adequate,"" said Julia Ahmed of Womens Health Coalition, adding that AIDS programme started in the country long time ago, but lack of sustainable leadership and ensuring enough condom to vulnerable groups hinders the advancement of the programme. The speakers stressed the need for female condom as it can act as one of the tools of their empowerment and women can take their sexual decision by using it. However, it needs reduction of the cost of female condom and capacity building of women before using it. HIV/AIDS is also a health and socio economic issue and as such social steps to combat the disease need to be strengthened, said Sultana Kamal, former adviser to caretaker government, adding that raising awareness, supply of condoms and womens empowerment is also equally important in this regard. "" It needs coordinated efforts among the government and non-government organisations,"" she added. While moderating the roundtable, Joint Editor of the Prothom Alo Abdul Quayum said there are around 11,000 AIDS patients in the country. From this it can be assumed that the actual number of patient is far more than that as a large number of people do not expose it, he added. ""This also increases the chance of spreading the disease as other people cannot take any precautionary measures,"" said Quayum.

HIV-positives still face stigma,,,2009-12-02,The Daily Star,"Rahim (not his real name) had been suffering from tooth decay and he needed to undergo root canal treatment without any delay. But he failed to receive any treatment even in a month despite his desperate attempts to be cured. He visited five hospitals in the city but all of them turned him away. The reason: Rahim, 34, is an HIV-positive. Failing to endure unbearable tooth pain, he finally decided not to reveal his HIV status while seeking treatment and it worked. ""I had to adopt this unfair means, otherwise any hospitals or clinics would not treat me,"" said Rahim, now working with an NGO. ""I went to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Suhrawardi Hospital and three other private clinics at Mirpur. But they turned me away after I informed them of my HIV status. So, I decided to hide my HIV status. Finally, I could receive root canal treatment at a dental clinic in the city,"" he said, recalling that it was August 2007. As a migrant worker, Rahim had been in Saudi Arabia for five and a half years. After he was diagnosed with HIV during a medical check-up in 2004, the Saudi government sent him back. ""After my return to the country what hurt me most was that everybody tried to avoid me as if talking to me would cause them to contract HIV. Even the hospitals and clinics deprived me of the right to seek treatment,"" he said. Like Rahim, there are an estimated 1495 people who are living with HIV/AIDS in the country. They continue to experience stigmatisation in society and are deprived of their basic rights despite massive awareness campaign, treatment and other initiatives taken by the government and non-government organisations. ""Hiding ones HIV status is quite alarming and it could cause massive spread of the infection, as the doctors are yet to follow universal precaution completely. If they dont know whether the patient is an HIV-positive, their carelessness can increase the risk of transmission of HIV,"" said Prof Nazrul Islam, virologist and former vice chancellor of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). Habiba Akhter, executive director of Ashar Alo Society, said only the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) has been providing treatment to HIV-positives, but their entry to the other public and private healthcare centers is almost prohibited as even the doctors and nurses stigmatise them. The situation hasnt changed much since 1989, when the first HIV-positive person was identified in the country. According to a study, some 16.8 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS decided not to go to any hospitals to seek treatment.

AIDS epidemic a disaster for Africa: Red Cross,,,2008-06-28,The Daily Star,"Africas AIDS epidemic is so severe that it should be classed as a disaster comparable to floods or famine, the Red Cross said Thursday. In its annual ""World Disasters Report"", the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that there was ""no doubt"" that HIV/AIDS matches the UN definition of a disaster. About two thirds of the worlds HIV-positive cases are in sub-Saharan Africa. At least one person in 10 is living with HIV in nations such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zambia, the report said. The UNs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs classes a disaster as a ""serious disruption of the functioning of a society, causing widespread human, material or environmental losses which exceed the ability of a society to cope using only its own resources"". The Red Cross said such a crisis now exists in Africa. The consequences of the epidemic are felt by all of society and not just those who are sick, due to the economic strain and social tensions. ""Reflecting on the lives of most people living in sub-Saharan Africa raises more alarm than hope,"" the IFRC said. ""The virus is directly responsible for restraining and reducing human and resource capacities across societies because HIV infections and AIDS deaths are common among workers of all qualifications and expertise, and in all industries. ""Coupled with the high costs of caring for people living with HIV, those capacity constraints lead to withered health and education systems, declining food security, skilled labour shortages and an increasingly ramshackled infrastructure,"" the report warned. Lindsay Knight, who edited the report said: ""The HIV and AIDS epidemic is a disaster whose scale and extent could have been prevented. Ignorance, stigma, political inaction, indifference and denial all contributed to millions of deaths."" Mobility and migration are adding further difficulties in the management of the disaster. ""The HIV epidemic can spell disaster for both sending and receiving communities, as well as communities along transit routes,"" said the report. For instance, in countries with relatively low HIV prevalence, such as the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan, a larger proportion of returning migrants had the disease compared to the general populations. About 35 percent of all documented HIV cases in the Philippines were among returning workers who have worked overseas, while in 2006, they made up 42 percent of new HIV cases, the report noted. The World Health Organisation said this month that the number of people in developing countries receiving antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV had risen sevenfold in the past three years to nearly three million by 2007. But a WHO co-authored report found that much more needed to be done: despite the increase, an estimated 6.7 million people in need of anti-retrovirals were still unable to access medicines, out of a total of 9.7 million. The report, produced in conjunction with UNAIDS and Unicef, said that the rise was due to the increased availability of drugs, in part due to price cuts, but also to delivery systems better adapted to specific country needs. But there was also increased demand for the treatment, as the number of people tested and diagnosed with HIV climbed, the WHO noted. Earlier this year, a joint UN study found that more than two million children worldwide were living with the HIV virus in 2007, most of whom were infected before they were born.",{},"['red', 'africa', 'cases', 'disaster', 'million', 'report', 'hiv', 'living', 'aids', 'society', 'cross', 'epidemic']","Africa's AIDS epidemic is so severe that it should be classed as a disaster comparable to floods or famine, the Red Cross said Thursday.

Engineered stem cells kill HIV,,,2012-04-17,The Daily Star,"Expanding on previous research providing proof-of-principle that human stem cells can be genetically engineered into HIV-fighting cells, a team of UCLA researchers have now demonstrated that these cells can actually attack HIV-infected cells in a living organism. The study, published April 12 in the journal PLoS Pathogens, demonstrates for the first time that engineering stem cells to form immune cells that target HIV is effective in suppressing the virus in living tissues in an animal model, said lead investigator Scott G. Kitchen, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of hematology and oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and a member of the UCLA AIDS Institute. ""We believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals, in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body,"" he said. In the previous research, the scientists took CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes -- the ""killer"" T cells that help fight infection -- from an HIV-infected individual and identified the molecule known as the T cell receptor, which guides the T cell in recognizing and killing HIV-infected cells. However, these T cells, while able to destroy HIV-infected cells, do not exist in great enough quantities to clear the virus from the body. So the researchers cloned the receptor and used this to genetically engineer human blood stem cells. They then placed the engineered stem cells into human thymus tissue that had been implanted in mice, allowing them to study the reaction in a living organism. The engineered stem cells developed into a large population of mature, multi-functional HIV-specific CD8 cells that could specifically target cells containing HIV proteins. The researchers also discovered that HIV-specific T cell receptors have to be matched to an individual in much the same way an organ is matched to a transplant patient. In this current study, the researchers similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature T cells that can attack HIV in tissues where the virus resides and replicates. They did so by using a surrogate model, the humanized mouse, in which HIV infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans. In a series of tests on the mices peripheral blood, plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells, the researchers found that the number of CD4 ""helper"" T cells -- which become depleted as a result of HIV infection -- increased, while levels of HIV in the blood decreased. CD4 cells are white blood cells that are an important component of the immune system, helping to fight off infections. These results indicated that the engineered cells were capable of developing and migrating to the organs to fight infection there.

Prevalence of AIDS still low,,,2012-12-02,The Daily Star,"The World AIDS Day was observed yesterday in the country as elsewhere across the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and demonstrate international solidarity to end the pandemic. Theme of the day for 2011-2015 is ""Getting to zero: zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths"". The day was an opportunity for public and private partners to spread awareness about the status of the pandemic and encourage progress in its prevention, treatment and care in high prevalence countries and around the world, reports UNB. Different organisations observed the day though holding processions, awareness campaigns and discussions across the country while National AIDS Congress-2012 took place at Osmani Memorial Hall in the capital. Addressing the national congress, Health Minister AFM Ruhal Haque said Bangladesh was able to maintain its low prevalence status of HIV as the number of AIDS patients was still â€œless compared to other developing nationsâ€, reports BSS. ""Although we have been able to maintain low prevalence status of HIV, young generation and migrant workers are at risk to HIV infection,"" he added. In 2012, as many as 390 HIV infected patients were detected in the country while AIDS patients stood at 103, the minister said. He said the number of total HIV cases stood at 2,871 this year against 2,533 in 2011. Ruhal urged all to work together to achieve the target of zero new infections and zero AIDS-related deaths by 2015.

All parameters of health sector have witnessed a good progress during the tenure of the present government, Modasser said. UNFPAs Erken observed that most of the people of Bangladesh did not have enough knowledge about AIDS and HIV, while stigma, discrimination and the role of media were hampering the prevention of the disease. He stressed the need for educating people, particularly married women and young generation, about the disease as a prevention measure. Habiba said only 800 HIV patients out of 2,871 were brought under Anti-Recto Viral (ARV) treatment and many remained out of treatment because of social stigma. â€œIntensive awareness campaignsâ€ should be launched across the country to remove social stigma and misconception about the disease, she added.

Experts worried at increasing HIV cases among IDUs,,,2007-08-22,The Daily Star,"Expensive treatment, increasing inequality, social stigma and a weak human rights regime were identified as challenges to combating HIV/AIDS on the third day of a mega conference in Colombo yesterday. The concern was aired at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) in the Sri Lankan capital, where experts also said they are significantly worried at the increasing rate of HIV infection among the injecting drug users (IDU) in Bangladesh, as they fear it may go up astronomically without immediate action. The Asian Peoples Alliance for Combating HIV/AIDS (APACHA) criticised the World Trade Organisation (WTO) policies and the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TIRPS) as they impede the access to anti-retro viral drugs at affordable prices for millions around the world. APACHAs Asia Regional Coordinator Prabodh Devkota said, ""The debilitating human rights condition, increasing democratic deficit, unabated conflicts and religious fundamentalism in most of the countries in Asia pose great challenges to addressing the causes and consequences of HIV and AIDS."" ""The increasing inequalities in the region, mass exodus and exacerbating violence, particularly against women, are making the fight against the epidemic more complex,"" he added. ""People are dying from AIDS-related diseases because they have no access to food, medicine, care and support. Those who are struggling to escape the jaws of death are compelled to put up with stigma, discrimination and inhuman treatments: a mockery of democracy,"" he said. Meanwhile, the concern surrounding Bangladesh expressed at the launch of an IDU-focused HIV prevention programme in Saarc by the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS on the sidelines of the conference. ""With Bangladeshs IDU (HIV-infected) rates going above 5 percent, it is causing us serious worry,"" said Gary Lewis, from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. He added that past experiences show that IDU HIV-infection rates can jump from 5 percent to 60 percent within a year, as they did in Thailand. He said Bangladesh require intensive programmes to prevent the spread of HIV as these countries have insufficient coverage and a lack of policies, laws and customs. But, he said, a generalised epidemic is preventable and containable in South Asia as 99.6 percent of its 1.5 billion inhabitants are still not affected by HIV. Worldwide 39.5 million people are affected by HIV, with 630,000 deaths in Asia alone. Currently, there are 12,000 people affected by HIV in Bangladesh, with around 700 deaths in the past year, according to World Bank figures. The mega conference attended by 3,000 people again looked to share their experiences to prevent HIV in the region, with a greater focus on the obstacles posed by stigma and discrimination against people affected by HIV/AIDS and also the dearth of government and corporate efforts to deal with the scourge. South African Supreme Court Judge Edwin Cameron, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, warned that without a system for treatment and support for HIV positive patients, a country should not test patients for the virus as it only creates panic without a solution.",{},"['cases', 'hivaids', 'idus', 'idu', 'asia', 'hiv', 'increasing', 'experts', 'world', 'stigma', 'worried', 'rights', 'affected', 'bangladesh']","Expensive treatment, increasing inequality, social stigma and a weak human rights regime were identified as challenges to combating HIV/AIDS on the third day of a mega conference in Colombo yesterday.

Cambodia probes new village HIV outbreak,"Cambodia health officials yesterday were screening hundreds of villagers for HIV after 14 locals tested positive for the virus, sparking fears of a fresh outbreak.",,2016-02-23,The Daily Star,"Cambodia health officials yesterday were screening hundreds of villagers for HIV after 14 locals tested positive for the virus, sparking fears of a fresh outbreak. Nervous villagers from Peam, an hour north of the capital Phnom Penh, have flocked to a house where a team of health officials were taking blood samples. Ly Peng Sun, the director of the National Centre for HIV, said moves to test the entire village were made after 14 people screened positive earlier this month. ""More than 140 people have come for testing (today) and the results so far show around 50 people are HIV-negative,"" he added. HIV rates are high in impoverished Cambodia but the country has made significant gains against the virus in recent years. However fears are running high after a recent outbreak in another village left more than 200 infected. That outbreak was traced to an unlicensed doctor reusing dirty needles who has since been jailed. Some of those testing positive in Peam believe they may have been infected by a doctor, locals said. ""The villagers are nervous now. They suspect the doctor might have spread HIV,"" Phy Sobin, 33, told AFP by telephone after she tested negative. ""I used to get many injections from the doctor. I and my two kids tested negative for HIV, but my husband has not tested yet,"" she said, adding that her 67-year old aunt had been confirmed HIV-positive. However Ly Peng Sun said it was too early to say what caused the latest outbreak. The doctor at the centre of the previous outbreak in the western province of Battambang was jailed for 25 years, partly because some of his patients died after being infected. The case shone a spotlight on the chronically underfunded healthcare system in the impoverished nation.

“Prevention is better than treatment”,"Working for CARE BANGLADESH for the last eight years, Sakina Sultana sounds",,2015-12-01,The Daily Star,"Working for CARE BANGLADESH for the last eight years, Sakina Sultana sounds very enthusiastic talking about the current situation and hurdles that Bangladeshi women face in terms of the awareness of HIV/AIDS. HIV rates in Bangladesh are low, under 0.1%, however certain population groups, such as people who inject drugs (PWID) are more at risk of HIV infection. “FWID (females who inject drugs) are usually viewed as the most vulnerable, as they are at risk of GBV and HIV. That is they are usually the last to be provided with the drug in a group of drug users sharing needles.” says Sakina. The prevalence of AIDS is controlled and confined in Bangladesh making the number of HIV positive individuals low but not decreasing. “Donors seem uninterested in providing further funds for this reason”, says Sakina. Women become victims of gender based violence and inadvertently get infected with HIV for a number of reasons. Often most FWID will resort to sexual acts, unprotected in exchange for drugs or money to buy them. Many men will even inject women with drugs in order to coerce them into having sex. This often makes them victims of gang rapes and other forms of physical assault. Sometimes it is their own intimate partners who force them to have sex with others for the aforementioned reasons. Most female PWIDs are also victims of gender based violence. The lack of funds has led to a lot of downsizing and closing down of PWIDS centres around the country and currently there are only two such centres for FWID. “Society stigmatizes and alienates drug users and if the user is a woman, the effects are multiplied that only leads them to relapse again. This is a vicious cycle.” Says Sakina disappointingly. Although Bangladeshs prevalence is not something to be worried about, the fact that it is still present is a matter of concern for those who work closely on these issues. Due to lack of funding, HIV screening is also another factor amongst female external migrants. “Our neighbouring countries have a higher prevalence rate and there is a constant flow of external migrants from Bangladesh. As HIV screening is an ethical issue, it cannot be done without the consent of the individual and the social stigma related to the disease makes the whole process complicated.” says Sakina. Women make up a significant portion of the cross-border mobile population. The lack of necessary legal documents or proper education makes them easier to manipulate. Many will allow them to cross borders in exchange for sexual favours and reluctance has more so than often resulted in gender based violence. Projects such as Emphasis that work in cooperation with local NGOs, India, Nepal work on two mobility routes between Bangladesh-India and Nepal-India by delivering focused interventions at source, transit and destination points. A Regional Secretariat is based in Nepal to provide overall program direction and day to day oversight of country level program teams in Bangladesh. The project has yielded significant results supporting the importance of screening but funding is limited to make any big changes at present. Targeted interventionsto support families of drug users or the users themselves are insufficient in halting HIV infection rates. What Bangladesh needs is comprehensive programming that focuses on high risk groups, as well as the general population especially adolescents. “We are all aware of what HIV/AIDS is but little is being done to teach the masses about HIV infection and prevention.”",{},"['based', 'women', 'sakina', 'work', 'hiv', 'better', 'drug', 'users', 'victims', 'drugs', 'treatment', 'prevention', 'bangladesh']","That is they are usually the last to be provided with the drug in a group of drug users sharing needles.” says Sakina. Women become victims of gender based violence and inadvertently get infected with HIV for a number of reasons. “Society stigmatizes and alienates drug users and if the user is a woman, the effects are multiplied that only leads them to relapse again. Targeted interventionsto support families of drug users or the users themselves are insufficient in halting HIV infection rates. “We are all aware of what HIV/AIDS is but little is being done to teach the masses about HIV infection and prevention.”",https://www.thedailystar.net/supplements/unfpa-supplement/%E2%80%9Cprevention-better-treatment%E2%80%9D-180379
Big blow for Aids battle,,,2014-07-20,The Daily Star,"Joep Lange Joep Lange, the virologist, who was killed in the Malaysian Airlines crash in eastern Ukraine aged 59, was a pioneer in the field of HIV/Aids since the days when the epidemic was first identified in the early 1980s; in recent years he was at the forefront of the campaign to improve access to anti-retroviral drugs in poor countries. Lange was instrumental in the development of techniques of clinical care of HIV-infected patients from as early as 1982, when the disease, then spreading rapidly among gay men, did not even have a name. In the later 1980s, as a researcher at Amsterdam University Hospital, Lange led pioneering research into the risk of a carrier of HIV developing full-blown Aids, establishing that the risk is determined by the level of a protein known as “P24” in a carriers blood. He went on to lead early tests on the drug Retrovir, an antiretroviral which proved to be the first breakthrough in Aids therapy, significantly reducing the replication of HIV in patients. In a pilot study 18 Dutch HIV-positive men were given the drug; in 13 of them the count of antibodies against the virus (an indication of its presence) was reduced significantly by the treatment. Lange went on to lead a joint programme, involving research bodies in London, Copenhagen, Sydney and Amsterdam, which confirmed these early findings. Later he led research on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Partly due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy in richer countries, Aids is now largely a disease of the poor. More than 95 per cent of infections occur in developing countries. As head of Clinical Research and Drug Development at the Global Programme on Aids of the World Health Organisation in the 1990s, then as president of the International Aids Society from 2002 to 2004, and finally as founder chairman of the non-profit PharmAccess Foundation until his death, Lange criss-crossed the world speaking at conferences, advising local health workers and launching campaigns to provide affordable access to effective drug therapy in poorer countries: “If we can get cold Coca-Cola and beer to every remote corner of Africa, it should not be impossible to do the same with drugs,” he declared. Sometimes his campaigns took on an apocalyptic note. At a conference in London in 2004 he warned that while HIV/Aids did not by itself cause wars and insurgencies, it was nonetheless severely destabilising in other ways: “South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland will be potential basket cases if they dont act, and in the case of Botswana, if it doesnt act, it will cease to exist,” he said. Joseph Lange, always known as “Joep” was born at Nieuwenhagen in the Netherlands on September 25 1954 and studied Medicine at the University of Amsterdam, qualifying in 1981 and taking a PhD in 1987. As well as taking leading positions on many international bodies concerned with Aids, from 2006 he was a Professor at the Academic Medical Centre at the University of Amsterdam, where he guided more than 30 PhD students and published more than 350 papers in peer-reviewed journals. A founding editor of the academic journal Antiviral Therapy, he was also scientific director of HIV[e]Ducation, an online learning site for medical professionals. On Thursday morning Lange boarded Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 to attend an international conference on Aids in Melbourne, Australia, where he was due to speak on Sunday. Both he and his wife Jacqueline have been confirmed as among the crash victims, along with a large number of other delegates travelling to the conference. Lange was the doting father of five daughters. Among the many messages on Twitter posted by his colleagues, one friend recalled how she had often found him cooking for his daughters while on conference calls discussing HIV: “I asked him why he worked so much. He said “Do you know how much it costs to buy shoes for five girls?”",{},"['big', 'blow', 'lange', 'early', 'university', 'international', 'therapy', 'hiv', 'drug', 'aids', 'battle', 'research', 'amsterdam']","He went on to lead early tests on the drug Retrovir, an antiretroviral which proved to be the first breakthrough in Aids therapy, significantly reducing the replication of HIV in patients.

Fight ignorance to increase anti-HIV/AIDS awareness,,,2012-12-05,The Daily Star,"I think gloomily of over 400 organizations that claim to be working on HIV/AIDS while ignorance is widespread and damagingâ€¦â€¦ How can you build the 3rd storey of a house before laying the foundations? Too many have never had proper teaching about basic reproductive health. About 8 years ago, the Bangladesh Centre for Communication Programs (BCCP) brought out a wonderful Adolescent Reproductive Health suitcase of resources for 9 -19 year olds, including booklets, DVDs/Videos in 4 stages, beginning with Its your puberty and ending with marriage preparation and HIV/AIDS - though this was made optional. A team came to the school where I was Principal to show it to the teachers, many of whom said, â€œI wish I had been told these things!â€ and wondered how anyone could take exception to the material. I was given a huge list of schools that had agreed to use it and noted they were all Bengali-medium. (The resources were in both languages but I was told it is a difficult subject to teach in Bengali as so many of the words used are considered dirty whereas, in English, they are more neutral.) I asked the superintendent if our school could use it. The owner of the time had friends in politics and education and later reported, â€œThey laughed and said the resources had only been ordered to please the donors but they would lie on the shelves until they got dusty and then be thrown away as the parents would never agree.â€ Later, I wondered if schools could close for a day and have it as a voluntary programme for the children of parents who did agreeâ€¦.

Build awareness to combat Aids better,,,2012-11-19,The Daily Star,"The media should play a significant role in educating people on HIV/AIDS and raise awareness about it, as the people of the country have limited knowledge about the disease, said discussants at a roundtable yesterday. With reports, views and analysis, mass media could also contribute to break the silence which is decisive to remove the sense of social stigma about the infection and arrest transmission of the deadly disease, they observed. Doctors, development partners, NGO activists and government officials took part in the discussion styled â€œRole of media in HIV prevention in Bangladeshâ€. The Daily Star and UNFPA jointly organised the discussion at The Daily Star Centre in Dhaka. Addressing the roundtable, UNFPA Country Representative in Bangladesh Arthur Erken called for collaboration between HIV/AIDS prevention and service providers, and the media to disseminate information among people. Emphasising capacity building of the media, Arthur Erken, who moderated the discussion, said more human interest stories should be run on the issue. UNAIDS Country Coordinator in Bangladesh Leo Kenny said the media should run more investigative stories on the expenditure of fund provided by the development partners to fight HIV/AIDS. Popular faces and famous people should be involved in the awareness campaigns to help contain the disease, he added. The Daily Star Editor and Publisher Mahfuz Anam stressed gathering of knowledge and experience from Africa, Europe, the US and other countries on how the media there had handled the issue over the last few years. He also emphasised bringing regional and international experts for gaining knowledge. BBC Bangla Service Editor Sabir Mustafa said the media should run stories to educate people, but it should not be a part of any project with development partners as it might raise questions about the credibility of the initiative. He added that all the stories to be chosen for newspapers should be newsworthy. Associate Editor of the Prothom Alo Abdul Quayum said the campaign for disseminating information on HIV/AIDS should be strengthened keeping special focus on the expatriate Bangladeshi workers. Khandaker Ezazul Haque, HIV focal point of UNFPA, Bangladesh, said the media should play a supportive role to create a congenial atmosphere so that people can discuss openly about the disease. He said messages should be published in such attractive ways that they could draw peoples attention. Zeenat Sultana, deputy director of Bangladesh Centre for Communication Programme (BCCP), said messages like there is a link between early marriage and HIV infection should be focused in media. MS Mukti, executive director of Mukto Akash Bangladesh, urged media policymakers to bring out supplementary issues or programmes on HIV/AIDS on a weekly or monthly basis. Habiba Akhter, executive director of Ashar Alo Society, said information like where an infected can get service, test facility and information about the disease should also be covered by the media. Project Coordinator of Family Planning Association of Bangladesh Hasina Shipra said detailed information, not just a line or so, and messages should be published in the media. ABM Kamrul Ahsan, HIV and AIDS specialist of UN office on Drugs and Crime in Bangladesh, said it should be also taken care of that correct and complete information is disseminated. Kazi Ali Reza, officer-in charge of United Nations Information Centre (UNIC), said it was important that the people were told how they can remain safe from the disease. Md Enamul Haque, national consultant-HIV/AIDS of World Health Organisation, Bangladesh Country office, said there were many hidden cases of HIV infection in Bangladesh. If these cases are not identified, it is not possible to bring down the infection rate to zero.

Modhumita project was launched to strengthen HIV prevention, care and treatment services while Mamoni project for integrated safe motherhood, newborn care and family planning. The projects were launched at a programme titled USAID-Supported Health and Population Projects at a city hotel. Adviser to Prime Minister Prof Syed Modasser Ali as the chief guest called on non-government organisations (NGOs) to work together for achieving the targets of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5. The achievement in MDG 4 and 5 that aimed at reducing child mortality and improving maternal health should have to be sustainable achievement, he added. “Basically, the NGOs should work in such a way so that the infrastructure of the healthcare sector and services could be expanded.” Prof Modasser said the facilities of community clinics should be utilised to full extent. If there is any shortcoming in any community clinic, it should be brought to the notice of the government for immediate action. Presiding over the programme, DGHS Director General Prof Shah Monir Hossain said various NGOs are working in different areas, but the overall status of the areas are not changing. Misti McDowell, country director of Family Health International, and Kelland Stevenson of Save the Children also spoke. Denise Rollins, mission director of USAID, and Dr Mohammad Ali Belal, line director of National AIDS/STD Programme, briefly presented the programmes taken under the projects.

HIV drugs make breast-feeding safer,,,2008-02-10,The Daily Star,"A drug that helps prevent babies from catching the AIDS virus at birth can also protect them while nursing, researchers reported. Babies of HIV-infected women who were given the drug nevirapine while they breast-fed were half as likely to become infected, the researchers told a meeting in Boston of AIDS experts. Nevirapine is already widely used to protect babies at birth. A single dose given to the mother as she goes into labor and to the baby at birth cuts transmission by 47 percent. But babies continue to become infected after birth, via their mothers breast milk, which can carry the virus. In many developing countries breast-feeding is the only option. Dr Brooks Jackson of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and colleagues in Ethiopia, India and Uganda wanted to see if they could safely continue giving the drug to babies for as long as six weeks. They gave 2,000 new babies either nevirapine or a vitamin solution between 2001 and 2007. ""At 6 months of age, the risk of postnatal HIV infection or death in infants who received the six-week regimen was almost one-third less than the risk for infants given only a single dose,"" Johns Hopkins said in a statement.

Italy Makes Headway on HIV Vaccine,,,1999-01-05,The Daily Star,"There was a time in the history of AIDS when a vaccine against the disease seemed so remote. While it will still be a few years before anything is on the market, much progress has been made. Gemini News Service reports on work by Italian researchers, who believe they may be on the way to finding the key to cheap protection against HIV. Italian researchers have come a step closer to a vaccine against HIV, the Human Immonudeficiency Virus which leads to AIDS, after recent successful trials on animals and humans. In two different trials - one on monkeys by Barbara Bensoli of ISS, the Italian Institute of Health, and one of 14 HIV-positive volunteers by Alessandro Gringeri at the Policlinic Hospital of Milan - a new HIV vaccine seems to have proved effective both in the prevention and therapy of the disease. The Italian vaccine is based on an ""inactive"" protein - that is, deprived of its biological activity - of HIV, isolated from the virus of infected people. The Tat protein - the HIV transcriptional activitation protein - is essential for HIV replication. It is the ""core"" protein of the virus, feeding it and allowing it to grow and expand, passing from an infected cell to a healthy one. The Anti-Tat vaccine neutralises the Tat protein, which - according to the Italian researchers who developed it - effectively robs HIV of its malignant characteristics. The Italian researchers believe that this is the only really effective way to stop the virus. Currently, there are several vaccine candidates being researched worldwide that could be given to uninfected people exposed to HIV. However, none are expected to be available for at least a few years. Most recently, on 27 November, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative launched two projects to develop vaccines: one a partnership between Nairobi and Oxford universities, the other a collaboration between a US biotechnology company and the University of Cape Town. In the first Italian trial, the vaccine was injected in a group of seven uninfected monkeys. After two months, the researchers injected the vaccinated monkeys with HIV; five out of seven proved resistant. ""The Italians have prevented a high percentage of monkeys from getting the disease,"" commented Marc Girard, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. ""It is a great result, and nobody has managed to do the same. The Tat-protein should be added to the vaccines scheduled for human trials in 2000."" Their choice of active ingredient makes it different from previous vaccines, many of which have proved unsuccessful in trials. Most were based on parts of the Env-protein, the substance which coats the surface of HIV. In the wake of the first trials on monkeys, research from now on will be directed at finding the right dose of Tat protein to implement the vaccine, with further trials to be conducted on monkeys in the next few months. While the ISS has taken the cautious route of working on monkeys, the Policlinic Hospital in Milan has headed straight for human volunteers. Gringeri, a researcher at the Policlinics ""Angelo Bonomi"" Emophily Institute, gave 14 HIV-positive volunteers the Policlinics version of the vaccine. Unlike the monkeys, the volunteers immune systems were already affected and their T-cells - the cells in the body that produce the antibodies which resist disease - were already devastated by the virus. But even so, tests showed that they produced specific antibodies to HIV. The results have been sufficiently encouraging that similar experiments will soon be conducted in the USA as well. Gringeri is leading a pool of Italian and foreign researchers who have been working on Tat for the past year. Those involved include US researcher Robert Gallo, one of the early pioneers in AIDS research; Daniel Sazury of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and scientists at the University of Brussels in Belgium and the Rehovot research institute in Israel. The Gringeri vaccine is intended to be an immunisation therapy supporting the conventional ""tridrug"" treatment using protease inhibitor drugs (such as sequinavir, zidovudina and indinavir), currently used on HIV-positive patients in developed countries. The second phase of experiments with the Gringeri vaccine will continue with other HIV-positive people, to identify the right amount for the best response from the immune system. This phase will be probably concluded within the first few months of next year. From there, though both projects must move on to the most important, and most risky, segment of testing - mass trials on human subjects. Ensolis team from the ISS are already planning trials late next year both in Italian hospitals and in Africa, where both the prevalence of the virus and the need for a vaccine is most severe. In the worst hit African countries, about 20 to 25 per cent of adults are infected. Whereas the cost of existing treatments for pre-existing HIV cases is way beyond the means of the countries in Africa and Asia who most need them, Ensoli is determined to make her vaccine more widely available. While the vaccine formula will be sold to a pharmaceutical firm, Ensoli has said she will negotiate with the firm to ensure it is available at an affordable price. ""When all the human trials have been concluded and the right dose identified, the new vaccine has to sold at a very low fee in developing countries,"" she said. Likewise, Gringeris team is also in the process of planning mass human trials in collaboration with hospitals in the developing world, scheduled for the end of next year. If all goes well, the Anti-Tat vaccine will be given to healthy volunteers who are regarded as ""at risk"" - for instance, those with an HIV-positive partner, or those living in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the difficulties in producing a vaccine stems from the fact that HIV is constantly mutating and has so many strains.

The looming threat of AIDS,,,2010-12-11,The Daily Star,"Health officials and concerned citizens in the country are grappling with the national implications of the HIV/Aids crisis and have been trying to come up with an answer to combat the threat that it poses. Experts see clear indications that the disease that was once supposed to be confined to some specific areas is now spreading wider. Reports from Indias National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) suggest that India had 2.27 million HIV affected people in 2009. These reports make people genuinely concerned since the virus may have crossed the borders with the traveling people and has started playing havoc in the country. Recalling the days when the first Aids case was detected in the country in 1989 -- the carrier being a returnee from abroad -- officials in the government argued that Aids was a western disease that would not affect our uniquely moral society. Out of 219 people diagnosed to be carriers of HIV virus till 2002 at BSMMUH at Dhaka, 111 were returnees from abroad, 26 of them later developed full-blown Aids and 20 of them died. Compared with the infection figures in African countries and India, Bangladesh is still considered a low HIV/Aids prevalent country. It is estimated that there are about 13000 HIV-positive people in the country now as revealed by WHO sources. UN experts have indicated that a disaster is waiting to happen in the Asian region, including Bangladesh. There are some 5 million new cases each year, of which 58% people under 25. Bangladesh has hundreds of sailors, construction workers and other professionals who work abroad for a time, and a continual tide of students and businessmen returning from overseas. Understandably, the growing number of HIV cases in India calls for stepping up efforts to halt the spread of the disease through cross border transmission. The most worrying aspect is the trafficking of teenage girls to India who eventually come back to Bangladesh, carrying with them HIV infection, and spread the disease. Villages in Bangladesh, these days, to say nothing of the cities and towns, are not, in fact, the bastions of sexual probity they are quaintly imagined to be. Studies show that Bangladeshi society, long considered so conservative, is more footloose than is commonly admitted. Experts have clear indications that the killer disease that once prowled the red light areas now stalks the bourgeois neighbourhoods. The increasing incidence of HIV infection in the country as revealed on the eve of the ""World Aids Day"" baffles the people and gives an alarming signal for all. Social researchers say: ""In our country, with all the economic problems, rising unemployment and drug abuse, only Aids was missing. Now we too havent been spared."" If the number continues to increase, as it has done from 219 infected people in 2002 to 13,000 by the end of 2009, it will be especially ominous for the country since it does not have medical facilities, physicians or drugs to adequately treat the disease. In Bangladesh, Aids treatment is completely NGO-dependent. Sources close to the government revealed that some donor-assisted NGOs like Ashar Alo society, Open Sky Bangladesh, and Confidential Approach to Aids Prevention (CAP) are providing ARV medicine to some 452 AIDS- infected patients. Aids is now the fourth leading cause of death globally and the leading cause of death in Africa. But interventions seem dauntingly difficult because Asian societies keep the source under wraps, a vice that stems from ignorance and lack of proper education. Sex in our society is not a subject of polite conversation. Public health officials have long despaired of this taboo because it makes the task of raising public awareness of sexually transmitted diseases more difficult. In most cases in our country, marriages are arranged and sex education is non-existent. The actual number infected with the virus may be quite high. The majority of the people who are infected now dont even know they are ill. We are talking about a generation that will have developed Aids sometime after the year 2015. And the country simply does not have the wherewithal to deal with such a crisis. Promiscuity is the single most important way by which the scourge has the possibility of spreading. People must know its incubation period, that keeps the virus hidden and after a certain time explodes in a virulent form, almost like an epidemic. So, an infected person can pass the virus unknowingly to scores of people. Most people with such promiscuous behaviour do not use contraceptives while having sex since they do not know that it exposes them to sexually transmitted diseases. Most worrisome, the virus now percolates insidiously and afflicts low risk individuals like housewives and children of wealthy people. Experts attribute this shift in the sexual behaviour of middle class or lower income groups to changes of culture in the workplace as the major reason. Besides, lack of housing facilities in the work place has spawned a breed of workers who spend half of their working lives away from home and family. At the same time, women have become an increasingly visible part of the professional workforce in industries, garment factories, hotels and business houses. With all these factors taken together, one can only see the settings for an increasing number of casual sexual relationships. Social scientists point out that the growing affluence of the middle class and the influence of alien movies have something to do with changing moral values. Without contradiction, one can say that the influence of the West is not an escapable factor. We have borrowed the gloss, but not the ability to fight a crisis. While, maintaining multiple sexual relationships is now considered ""high risk"" behaviour in the West, in our country, it has just become a symbol of liberation. At the same time, women are shedding their inhibitions and sexual ambitions of both the groups are running high. In the face of the impending Aids threat that is likely to jolt the country by the end of 2020, the government from, now on, will have to launch an intensive programme to halt the spread of the disease. The health ministry must ensure that hospitals and clinics ensure safe blood transfusion of patients and think seriously about screening those who they thought might be using drugs -- focusing mainly on young unemployed men. Lastly, both the administration and people must contend with the fact that Aids is no longer a medical problem, it is a social problem. This is a county where people are more inclined to holding seminars and symposia and formulating policies on the World Aids Day every year, without trying to implement the policies. We only hope that the government this time will not cause any shift in the rationale of the national agenda. Md. Asadullah Khan is a former teacher of physics and Controller of Examinations, BUET.

Efficient use of fund vital to fight HIV/AIDS: Dr Nafis Sadik,,,2009-11-11,The Daily Star,"Special Envoy to the UN Secretary General for HIV/AIDS Dr Nafis Sadik yesterday said funds to combat HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh is increasing but the efficient use of that fund is important. Young people should be involved in the policies and programmes to control HIV/AIDS, she added. Dr Nafis said this at a special lecture on AIDS in Asia and the vulnerability of young people in Bangladesh at Nabab Nawab Ali Senate Bhaban at Dhaka University. “New resources are flowing to the HIV and AIDS control programmes in Bangladesh. But you should know about your epidemic and spent in those places where the epidemic is. Use of the fund is very important,” she said. Dr Nafis, who had served UNFPA earlier as executive director, further said that treatment alone cannot control HIV and AIDS, successful policies and actions are needed. Women are amongst the most vulnerable population in Asia and they are not responsible for their vulnerability, rather it is because of mens behaviour and attitude to them, she noted. She reiterated that a cultural change is needed to empower women in decision-making in their sexual life and change of mens attitude and behaviour towards women. About the vulnerability of young people, Dr Nafis said youths are most vulnerable to HIV and AIDS but they dont have proper knowledge about the disease. A study showed that only one out of five young people know how to prevent the disease, she said, urging the young people to speak up and make the policy-makers hear their voices as well as needs. “It is a matter of health care, not morality and it is a matter of human rights. AIDS should be seen as a disease which be treated properly,” she said. Earlier, speaking as the special guest at the lecture session UNFPA Country Representative Arthur Erken said Bangladesh is a low prevalence but high at-risk country. Awareness level among people, including students, is still very poor, he said, adding that proper information and knowledge are not given to the youths, though they are at high at-risk. Dhaka University Vice Chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique, Pro-VC Prof Harun-or-Rashid and Dr Salil Panakadan, country director of UNAIDS, also spoke at the session. After the programme, a film festival on AIDS was also organised at the same venue.",{},"['young', 'control', 'vital', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'fund', 'efficient', 'special', 'aids', 'fight', 'nafis', 'dr', 'youths', 'vulnerability', 'sadik', 'bangladesh']","Special Envoy to the UN Secretary General for HIV/AIDS Dr Nafis Sadik yesterday said funds to combat HIV and AIDS in Bangladesh is increasing but the efficient use of that fund is important.

The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 717,,,,,"Health Event International AIDS Candlelight Memorial Day in Bangladesh Lighting the path to a brighter future Every year the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial draws thousands of communities together across the globe to light candles and demonstrate support for those who have been affected by HIV/AIDS. The International AIDS Candlelight Memorial Campaign, a programme of the Global Health Council, based in USA, is a 12-month mobilisation project that encourages communities and individuals around the world to become more involved with HIV/AIDS work through participation in a worldwide memorial. The Memorial takes place every year on the third Sunday of May. The date for this years International Candlelight Memorial was May 21, 2006, 3rd Sunday of the month, where worldwide coalition of coordinators has joined for orchestrating local candlelight memorial, a program of the Global Health Council for that day. The communities all over the world gathered together in solidarity to light the candle and remember those who have been impacted by HIV/AIDS. The Theme of this years memorial was ""Lighting the Path to a Brighter Future"". The campaign has four main objectives: 1. To honor the memory who were lost to AIDS 2. To show support for those living with HIV and AIDS 3. To raise community awareness and decrease stigma related to HIV/AIDS; and 4. To mobilise community involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS. United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said, ""We must make people everywhere understand that the AIDS crisis is not over; that this is not about a few foreign countries, far away. This is a threat to an entire generation, that it is a threat to an entire civilisation..."" Memorial observed in Bangladesh This year Rotary Club of Dhaka East (RI District 3280), in collaboration with UNFPA, ACNielsen Bangladesh, Social Marketing Company, Sanofi-Aventis, STD/AIDS Network and many other NGOs working on HIV/AIDS commemorated the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial at Dhaka Press Club.

Breakthrough in hunt for HIV vaccine,,,2013-11-02,The Daily Star,"US scientists seeking to unravel the mysteries of HIV have made an important breakthrough after capturing the clearest image yet of a protein which allows the deadly virus to attack human immune cells, new research showed Tuesday. Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College have managed to obtain a detailed view of the atomic structure of the protein which envelops HIV, the virus which causes AIDS. The development could potentially pave the way for a vaccine, according to the findings published in the US journal Science. ""In order to develop a vaccine, you have to understand what bits on that very important trimeric protein can be recognizes by broadly neutralizing antibodies,"" said Scripps Institute cell biologist Bridget Carragher. ""And in order to understand that, you need to understand what the structure of the thing looks like. ""Then once you do, you can start designing a vaccine that will mimic that thing and elicit an antibody response and get the human being to fight the real virus when it comes along."" Although sophisticated antiviral drugs have been used to manage HIV infections in many developed countries, a vaccine against infection has proved elusive. The failure to find a vaccine is often attributed to the complex nature of HIVs envelope protein, known as Env. The delicate structure of Env has hampered efforts to obtain the protein in a form that allows for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to fully understand it. ""It tends to fall apart, for example, even when its on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,"" said TSRI biologist Andrew Ward. However the researchers were able to engineer a version of the Env trimer, or three-component structure, that has the stability required for atomic-resolution imaging. The scientists were then able to study the Env trimer using cutting-edge imaging and electron microscopy. The use of X-ray crystallography allowed researchers to examine the Env trimer in more detail than previous attempts. The data also shed light on the process by which Env assembles and later shifts shape during infection, and also allowed researchers to make comparisons with protein envelopes from other deadly viruses such as flu and Ebola.",{},"['understand', 'virus', 'breakthrough', 'tsri', 'structure', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'env', 'hunt', 'researchers', 'trimer', 'protein']","The development could potentially pave the way for a vaccine, according to the findings published in the US journal Science.

Youths most vulnerable to AIDS,,,2008-12-02,The Daily Star,"With a view to strengthening the campaign to combat HIV/AIDS and to create mass awareness, the World AIDS Day was observed in the country yesterday as elsewhere across the globe. National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP), Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare observed the day in a befitting manner with the theme Lead-Empower-Deliver. A rally began from the east end of Manik Mia Avenue in front of the National Parliament and ended at Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre (BCFCC). Stakeholders from government, non-government, national, international organisations and donor agencies participated at the rally. At the inaugural ceremony of the programmes at the BCFCC, Dr Ferdous Alam Shibib, programme manager of NASP, delivered the welcome speech while Dr Mohammad Ishaque Khan, line director of NASP, presented the keynote paper. Director General of DGHS Prof MA Faiz, Director General of DGFP Quomaran Nessa Khanam, Country Director of Save the Children USA Kelland Stevenson and WHO representative to Bangladesh Dr Duangvadee Sungkhobol were present as special guests. Speaking as the chief guest, Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare AMM Nasir Uddin said that the youths are more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and STIs and to disseminate information on HIV/AIDS and STI among the youth and adolescent people, the role of media is very important. He urged the journalists and different stakeholders, including professional bodies, association leaders, religious leaders, policymakers and development partners to come forward in preventing HIV infection in Bangladesh. “The HIV infected new cases during this year was found 288 while new AIDS cases was 111 and total death case was 42,"" he said adding that the overall infection and AIDS cases is low this year compared to that of last year. Highlighting different steps of the government in combatting HIV/AIDS, Mohammad Abul Kalam Azad, additional secretary and chairperson of the World AIDS Day 2008 programme, said, “We are working together to eliminate stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and AIDS.” The Life Skills Education Workplace Policy on HIV/AIDS for Garment Workers was also launched at a city hotel yesterday.

“End demand” for sex work,"Research suggests that “end demand” laws are reducing demand for HIV services, according to panellists sharing the effectiveness of “end demand” policies at a press conference that featured scientific abstracts and input from advocates.",,2018-07-29,The Daily Star,"Research suggests that “end demand” laws are reducing demand for HIV services, according to panellists sharing the effectiveness of “end demand” policies at a press conference that featured scientific abstracts and input from advocates. “End demand” laws are being adopted or considered in a growing number of countries. Typically, under these laws, sex workers themselves commit no crime, but clients and any third parties are criminalised. Supporters of “end demand” laws have argued that this approach will increase sex workers’ access to essential services, including HIV prevention and care. But two studies presented at the 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) poked holes in this assertion, citing evidence from Canada and France. “Given the importance of sex workers in the global response to HIV, I think these studies deserve careful consideration,” Linda-Gail Bekker, President of the International AIDS Society and International Chair of AIDS 2018, said. “If ‘end demand’ laws create new barriers to HIV prevention and care, that is a very significant concern.” Canada’s law did not lead to increased access to HIV care for sex workers Elena Argento of the University of British Columbia presented an analysis of the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (PCEPA), a policy adopted by Canada in 2014 that criminalises sex work clients and third-party advertising. The analysis revealed substantial evidence that criminalisation impedes access to services and support for sex workers, even though an explicit goal of “end demand” approaches is to increase access. The authors aimed to longitudinally evaluate the impact of the PCEPA on sex workers access to HIV care, primary care and community-led and sex worker-led services in Vancouver, Canada. There was no evidence of increased access to HIV-specific services among sex workers living with HIV following implementation of the new laws. The post-policy period was also correlated with significantly reduced odds of accessing health services when needed. The study concluded that “end demand” approaches may, in fact, exacerbate barriers to healthcare and community-led services. French “end demand” law had a variety of negative consequences A second study dealt with a 2016 French law criminalising sex workers’ clients. Opponents of the law cite the risk of increased vulnerability among sex workers and exposure to stigma and violence, which hinders their access to health and legal services and increases risks of exploitation in the sex industry. Based on these arguments, Médecins du Monde (Doctors of the World) fielded a survey aimed at evaluating the impact of the law on sex workers health, rights and well-being. An analysis presented by Hélène Lebail, of CNRS – Sciences Po, Centre de Recherches Internationales, showed that the law’s most direct effect has been an acute increase in the socio-economic vulnerability of sex workers, including: an increase in experienced violence; degrading working conditions; and negative health consequences. The authors also found a decrease in condom use and increased difficulty for sex workers to negotiate safe-sex practices after the law took effect. Additionally, HIV-positive sex workers faced difficulty accessing services. While it is still too early to evaluate the impact in terms of HIV infections, the research pointed to an increase in some sexually transmitted infections, notably of syphilis, among sex workers in France. The authors concluded that policy makers should consider these findings when designing new laws to mitigate harmful health effects.",{},"['workers', 'work', 'demand', 'end', 'hiv', 'services', 'access', 'sex', 'laws', 'law', 'increase']","Research suggests that “end demand” laws are reducing demand for HIV services, according to panellists sharing the effectiveness of “end demand” policies at a press conference that featured scientific abstracts and input from advocates. “End demand” laws are being adopted or considered in a growing number of countries.

What are we doing about the threat?,,,2008-07-09,The Daily Star,"FROM expert opinions and periodic survey reports of the National Aids/STD program of the government of Bangladesh, one can infer that it is quite serious and the facts deserve wider dissemination in society. It is often said that Bangladesh is sitting on a HIV time bomb that is ticking unheard in our midst. Maybe it is ticking very slowly at the moment but no one knows what might go wrong and trigger an explosion someday, maybe not too far into the future. HIV/Aids experts have identified the tell-tale signs of the killer disease in many people in Bangladesh, and they are imparting the knowledge in very many ways and words. We have to stop, listen, learn and take appropriate measures so that we can avert that explosion. The tell-tale signs According to the National Aids/STD Program (NASP), about 10.5% of injectable drug users in the capital city are afflicted with HIV/AIDS virus. Which means that among the 2000 drug users 200 are faced with the possibility of developing into Aids patients in future. Experts like Prof. Nazrul Islam have termed this ""Concentrated Epidemic"" in a small area. It might be concentrated in a small area but we are not feeling comfortable about it at all. One research report of ICDDR,B says that the rate of infection of HIV among the injectable drug users (IDUs) across the country is less than 1%. In Dhaka the average HIV infection rate among IDUs is 7%. And the unnerving fact is, there are about 40,000 drug addicts in the country and many of them are turning to pushing drugs with syringe and needle used by many. The fight against spread of HIV infection Well, we have heard of the dangers, but what is being done to prevent the spread of HIV among the people of the country? It appears that there are some ongoing HIV/Aids prevention programs in the country that claim to have attained success in creating wider awareness among the common people, especially among the vulnerable groups, about the life-threatening aspects of HIV/Aids. NASP is in the forefront in the battle against the disease, and is currently implementing the action plan known as National Strategic Plan for HIV/Aids, 2004-2010. The program is being implemented with financial aid from Geneva based Global Fund, launched in Bangladesh in 2004, through signing of an agreement between Save the Children-USA and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This financial support of Global Fund has proved to be crucial in our fight against the spread of HIV, and is providing medical service and other assistance to those already infected. From NASP we learn that in a phase-wise financing, Global Fund has provided required funds for the implementation of Round-2 (2004-2009) to prevent HIV infection among the young people of Bangladesh, and Rond-6 (2007-2012) to provide service and assistance to the high-risk population and vulnerable young people in order to prevent and control spread of HIV, and service to those already infected with HIV. For the implementation of these two projects, Save the Children-USA is working as a management agency with government organisations, 61 NGOs (national and international), and private sector and research organisations. Under the supervision of NASP, size estimation and mapping of IDUs and road/hotel/house-based sex workers have been conducted in 54 districts of the country. Under this program, relevant information and services will be provided to 10,000 IDUs through 70 drop-in centers, and to 25,000 sex workers through 100 drop-in centers. To battle the scourge of Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, an international endeavour was initiated in 2002 that came to be known as the Global Fund To Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) or Global Fund. The objectives of Global Fund are to reduce poverty in the developing countries of the world through prevention and control of these diseases; to assist these countries in achieving the targets of the Millennium Development Goal -- MDG-6; and to combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases. Bachtey holey jantey hobey The slogan ""bachtey holey jantey hobey"" to create awareness about HIV/Aidshas become quite a household slogan by now thanks to widespread media publicity. Since no treatment of Aids has yet been discovered, prevention is the only way to fight HIV infection. And getting correct information is essential for taking such preventive measures. This rationale worked behind NASP approving the slogan ""bachtey holey jantey hobey."" What I find most interesting is that a full chapter on HIV/Aids has been included in the curriculum of SSC and HSC (from class 6 to 12) to create awareness among the young generation. According to NASP, this is for the first time in Asia that HIV/Aids related messages have been included in the English and Bengali textbooks from class VI to class XII. Under this program, 44, 375 teachers of 8, 875 educational institutes have been given the required training. And under this program, a campaign titled ""Religious leaders and HIV/Aids"" is being conducted Youth-friendly health care This is possibly the most important component among all the intervention programs. A national benchmark for youth-friendly health care services has been agreed upon by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Directorate of Health, Directorate of Family Planning, National Aids/STD Program, Civil Surgeons, World Health Organisation, and other experts to extend required services through 124 government, non-government and privately owned health care centers. At the same time, a life skill learning program to prevent HIV/Aids is being carried out for nearly 100,000 young people through the youth clubs/organisations and NGOs enlisted with the Directorate of Youth. It is said that because of the successful implementation of prevention and control of HIV/Aids with the financial aid from Global Fund, the knowledge of the people has increased, and they have become aware and understand the risk factors more. At the same time, the Aids stigma and discrimination has decreased significantly. The rate of use of condoms among the high-risk groups has increased, and the rate of infection by STD has reduced. This program had contributed to the low prevalence of HIV infection in the past years. The programs will contribute to the efforts of achieving Millennium Development Goal- MDG-6: Combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases.

Know your status,"Shirajul Islam was trying hard to stay awake. In between yawning, he was scratching his scruffy beard, not knowing what to say. It was Wednesday; 2:00pm to be exact. He looked tired.",,2018-12-01,The Daily Star,"Shirajul Islam was trying hard to stay awake. In between yawning, he was scratching his scruffy beard, not knowing what to say. It was Wednesday; 2:00pm to be exact. He looked tired. This correspondent waited patiently for the 40-year-old to start speaking. He opened his mouth but words just did not seem to come out. “I was… I was in prison for a year for carrying drugs,” he finally said in between stuttering. “I left my wife and daughter in 2008; I dont know where they are.” “I mostly spent my nights on footpaths,” Shirajul said. He slowly raised his arm towards his worn-out shirt. He left his hand there as if he forgot what he was planning to do or say. Shirajul has been doing drugs for a long time. He could talk very little about his life, that too with coherence. This correspondent was speaking with him at a rehabilitation centre in Dhakas Chankharpool area. Though its quite impossible to say how it started, the officials at the centre said Shirajul told them that his addiction was a result of peer pressure. As the addiction became worse, he was injecting drugs and soon started sharing needles with other addicts living on the streets. A few months back, he was spotted by some NGO workers, who brought him to the rehabilitation centre and got his blood tested. All the years of injecting drugs took a toll on him. His blood test came out HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) positive. He now takes medication suggested by the doctors at the centre to control the virus. At the same time, to control his addiction, he takes prescription opioids as part of his therapy. At the rehabilitation centre, this correspondent met many others who have tested positive for HIV and come to the centre for medication. This centre mostly deals with drug abusers, many of whom pose a threat of spreading HIV. This correspondent also spoke to two other HIV positive persons. Abida sold flowers for a living. The 35-year-old also lived on the streets and eventually under influence of others, started injecting drugs. An NGO recently brought her to the centre. Her condition is better than Shirajul as her infection was detected early. Mohammad Ujjal, on the other hand, had been diagnosed with HIV around 20 years ago. He comes to the centre regularly for his medication. “Early detection of the virus helps me control it,” said the 45-year-old Dhaka resident. “I dont do drugs anymore and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle such as avoiding narcotics, eating well and getting enough rest.” Ujjal currently owns a business in the city. PWID Like the three, People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) are being detected through blood tests and medical check-ups by NGO workers with support from the government. Not just them, sex workers and others from groups vulnerable to the virus are also being tested. According to the authorities concerned, the more people with HIV are being detected the better, as it helps identify them and take proper preventive measures. They also opine that increase of HIV detection does not mean increase of HIV/AIDS cases. Instead, it means the capacity of reaching out to more people has increased. Dr Belal Hossain, deputy director of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, said, “We are working towards enhancing our ability to increase HIV detection. However, the prevalence of AIDS is still low in the country.” According to the Safe Blood Transfusion Act, no one can test blood of a person without their consent, he said. “So, we need to create more awareness among people.” In this regard, Lima Rahman, chief of party (HIV/ AIDS programme) of Save the Children, said, “We could not detect the majority of the HIV cases yet. Social stigma and a lack of awareness among people still prevail.” “It is important to test your blood, to know your status for proper treatment, so that husband does not infect wife or wife does not infect her child,” she added. INITIATIVES The government has adopted the Fast Track Strategy of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) and is determined to achieve the 90-90-90 goals by 2020. Under this strategy, at least 90 percent of HIV cases have to be detected, 90 percent of patients have to come under proper treatment and 90 percent of patients HIV has to remain under control. To make that happen, the government is working with different development partners. There are also 25 HIV test and counselling centres across the country. Moreover, Dr Belal Hossain said, “HIV affected persons can avail free treatment at six government hospitals.” Besides, The Global Fund, a non-profit organisation, is providing fund to run HIV-related programmes by Save the Children under the monitoring of DGHS. At present, Save the Children and icddr,b are the two organisations in the country, who are working with PWID, sex workers and other HIV affected persons. With the support of the government and Save the Children, there are also 50 rehabilitation centres, also known as drop centres, across the country for PWID and sex workers. Other than free medication, the centres also conduct training and awareness campaigns and distribute free contraceptives and syringes. According to UNAIDS data (2018), there are estimated 13,000 HIV affected persons in the country. Of them, only 5,586 had been detected so far, while 3,265 of them are receiving free medication. ANTIRETROVIRAL, METHADONE Antiretroviral and Methadone are also given by the government through the centres for free to HIV patients and PWID. Antiretroviral drugs are medications for the treatment of infection by retroviruses, primarily HIV. Methadone is a powerful synthetic analgesic drug similar to morphine in its effects but less sedative and is used as a substitute drug in the treatment of morphine and heroin addiction. HIV IN BANGLADESH The first-detected case of HIV was in 1989 in the country, but a national committee on AIDS had been formed in 1985 for early detection of AIDS. According to UNAIDS data (2017), Bangladesh stood at the 10th position in HIV deaths among Asian countries whereas Indonesia stood first. In 2016, Bangladesh lost around 1,000 people due to AIDS. AIDS claimed 62,000 lives in India the same year, the highest in Asia. Around 36.9 million people were living with HIV in 2017, which was 36.3 million in 2016, according to the UNIAIDS data (2018). WORLD AIDS DAY TODAY The theme of this years World AIDS Day is “Know Your Status” as getting tested gives a person the knowledge needed to protect themselves and their partners. Also, according to officials and development workers, if one learns that they are HIV-positive, they can start treatment that will help them stay healthy, live longer and take steps to reduce the risk of passing HIV on to others.

HIV cases on rise,,,2011-12-02,The Daily Star,"Four hundred and forty-five people have been infected with HIV this year and 251 new cases of AIDS confirmed, said Health Minister AFM Ruhal Haque yesterday. Currently, the country has 2,533 HIV-infected people and 1,101 suffering from AIDS, said the health minister at a seminar at Osmani Memorial Hall in the city on the World AIDS Day styled Getting to Zero-Zero New HIV infections. Zero Discrimination and Zero AIDS Related Deaths. According to National AIDS/STD Programme (NASP) statistics, 243 people were infected with HIV last year and 231 cases of AIDS confirmed. This year, 84 people have died from the disease while last year the number was 37, said Ruhal Haque. A total of 325 patients died in the country since the first case was detected in 1989, he said quoting the ninth surveillance report 2011 published at the seminar. Sixty-five percent male, 33 percent female and two percent transgender are infected with HIV and AIDS this year, the minister added. The minister urged religious leaders, teachers, students and the youth force to come forward and create awareness about HIV/AIDS in the society and reduce the number of people infected with the virus to zero. Dr Abdul Waheed, line director of National AIDS/STD Programme, presented the keynote paper, which showed the rise of HIV/AIDS infected patients is highest in Dhaka and Chittagong. Based on occupation, migrant workers (31 percent) are mostly infected, he said. In the presentation Waheed said, 24,00,000 in India, 7,40,000 in China, 98,000 in Pakistan, 64,000 in Nepal, 1,000 in Bhutan and 5,30,000 people in Myanmar are infected with HIV/AIDS. He focused on some risk factors for HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh including not using sterilised injections, unprotected sexual contact, blood transfusion, injection of drugs, external and internal migration and high HIV prevalence in neighbouring countries with porous borders. Humayun Kabir, secretary to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Prof Dr Khandaker Md Sefyetullah, director general of DGHS, Arthur Erken, UNFPA representative, Abu Yusuf Choudhury, chairperson of STD/AIDS Network also spoke at the seminar.

Urgent steps needed to tackle AIDS,,,2007-12-02,The Daily Star,"While global HIV prevalence--the percentage of people living with HIV--has levelled off, the number of new infections has risen in the country. Recently Bangladesh has been reported as one of the five countries in the Asia-Pacific region where HIV/AIDS infections are rising. HIV in high-risk groups There is concerning proof that HIV infection continues to increase rapidly among the high-risk groups specially injecting drug users (IDUs). And nobody knows the actual figure of HIV infection in general population as we have no survey on them. The continued focus on high-risk groups has created a false sense of security and complacency in the general population including policy makers. HIV has already turned into a concentrated epidemic (spread at a rate of 5 percent or more) among IDUs [7 percent]. The country has entered near to the epidemic more or less but is still considered as low prevalence states according to current statistics. This statistical jargon of ‘low prevalence’ does not have much meaning particularly when viewed against large absolute numbers in some of the neighbouring countries of the region. The daunting epidemic burden and momentum however may be masked by the large population leading to low reported prevalence. So it is imperative for the country to depict the actual portrait of the country with a stronger empirical data and contextualise the problems faced in regard to HIV/AIDS and view them in correct perspective. In order to keep the prevalence low, Bangladesh needs a strong and effective policy through legal frameworks, coordination and strong HIV prevention, better treatment and care. Yet much more remains to be done to achieve the goal of universal access. Global coverage of many of the key interventions against HIV/AIDS remains low, and the growth in the number of new infections and people in need of treatment continues to outpace the capacity of health services to respond. Our financial resources also fall short of what will be needed to achieve universal access, and the sustained political commitment needed to tackle AIDS over the long term is still lacking in the country. Meeting the needs of affected communities will require a comprehensive response that addresses both prevention and treatment simultaneously. Working towards universal access by 2010 to achieve standard in HIV prevention, treatment, care and support is a very ambitious challenge. AIDS programmes will have to be equitable, accessible, affordable, comprehensive and sustainable. In the efforts to achieve universal access, country must face huge challenges. Stigma and discrimination continue to impede prevention and treatment efforts. Among the most important priorities is the strengthening of health services so that they are able to provide a comprehensive range of HIV/AIDS services to all those who need them. Somewhere HIV prevention programmes are not reaching the people most at risk of infection, such as young people, women and girls, men who have sex with men, sex workers and their clients, injecting drug users, and ethnic and cultural minorities. Current HIV prevention works but needs to be focused and sustained. HIV testing and counseling Over the past 20 years, voluntary counselling and testing programmes (VCT) have helped millions of people learn their HIV status, yet a very few people in high risk groups of our country know that they are infected. Efforts are urgently needed to increase the provision of HIV testing through a wider range of effective and safe options. HIV testing is a critical entry point to life-sustaining healthcare services for people living with HIV/AIDS and service delivery models need to be expanded to testing in antenatal care, sexually transmitted infection clinics, in-patient wards as well as free-standing client-initiated testing centres. Treatment and care After the first detection of HIV positive case in the country in 1989, the treatment and care are still inadequate. An infected person faces many inequities and discrimination in treatment and care. These are the very people who keep themselves away from seeking treatment for stigma and thus fuelling the infection to the general population. We need to ensure that the infection does not spread from this source, in order to stop the internal transmission. The infected persons should be educated on how to take care of himself/herself. But these people unfortunately are not getting any treatment or cannot buy costly antiretroviral (ARV) drugs; sometimes do not get even proper food or a place to stay. We need to give urgent attention to this matter. In the early years of AIDS when it was seen as ‘gay disease’, Africa failed to gain attention of the global health agenda that west did. They recgnised when it took more lives than any other disease. Failure of timely recognition of African episodes of AIDS delayed the response of the countries to crisis, making it the most AIDS-burden region in the world. Let us not leave ourselves open to a similar fate. It is the high time to rethink seriously. Action must not only be increased dramatically, but must also be strategic, focused and sustainable.",{},"['care', 'infection', 'steps', 'urgent', 'country', 'tackle', 'testing', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'need', 'low', 'aids', 'needed', 'treatment', 'prevention']","HIV in high-risk groupsThere is concerning proof that HIV infection continues to increase rapidly among the high-risk groups specially injecting drug users (IDUs).

'Raise awareness about AIDS',,,2009-02-07,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a programme underscored the need for raising awareness about HIV/AIDS among the young generation, who constitutes a major portion of the population, to prevent the spread of the deadly disease. Although HIV prevalence is low in Bangladesh, it is still considered a high-risk country for HIV/AIDS infection, they said. The speakers also said HIV/AIDS is not only a big problem to the public health, it is also a big obstacle in the way of development. It is imperative to disseminate accurate information about the disease among young generation as prevention is the only way to prevent HIV infection. Matra, an advertisement firm, organised the programme titled Janar Angikar, Jananor Angikar at a city hotel to present the progress and achievement of the project titled Prevention and control activities among the vulnerable and highly vulnerable young people.

S Africa to host 2016 AIDS conference,,,2014-07-26,The Daily Star,"South Africas port city of Durban will host the 21st International AIDS Conference in 2016, marking the forums return to Africa after 16 years, organisers said yesterday. Gathering scientists, policymakers and grassroots workers, the biennial conference is the biggest single get-together on the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The 20th conference in Melbourne drew around 20,000 people, of whom 13,600 were delegates and the rest were members of the public who attended an outreach event called the Global Village, the International AIDS Society (IAS) said as the six-day event wound down. The July 17-22 2016 conference will return to a venue that saw ""a watershed"" in the history of AIDS, said Chris Beyrer, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland, who will co-chair the event. Charged with emotion, the 2000 conference was the first to be held in Africa. It took place at a time when each year, hundreds of thousands of Africans were dying for lack of HIV drugs that were available in rich countries but beyond the financial reach of poor ones. Stirred by apartheid campaigner and former South African president Nelson Mandela, it unleashed the effort to bring down the cost of the drug lifeline and helped roll back AIDS denialism in the host country. The 2016 conference will be co-chaired by Beyrer and Olive Shisana, who heads South Africas Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC). Main topics in 2016 are likely to include progress towards providing drugs to all badly-infected people and the plight of HIV-infected women in Africa, they said. ""Coming back to Durban, after what will be 16 years after the last conference in Africa, will be a historical opportunity to close that treatment gap,"" Beyrer said. The South African province of KwaZulu-Natal ""has the highest rate of HIV among women anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""Durban is ground zero for women with HIV, and thats why we feel its so critically important to be there."" The International AIDS Conference alternates with a conference on scientific aspects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, next held in Vancouver, Canada, from July 19-22 2015. Since 1981, around 78 million people have been infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, according to the UN programme UNAIDS. Thirty-nine million have died from AIDS-related illnesses. In 2013, around 35 million people were living with HIV, nearly 71 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Last year, 12.9 million people in low- and middle-income countries had access to HIV drugs, but at least 28 million are eligible for them under World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.",{},"['south', 'women', 's', 'million', 'international', 'hiv', 'conference', 'beyrer', 'aids', 'drugs', 'host', '2016', 'africa']","South Africa's port city of Durban will host the 21st International AIDS Conference in 2016, marking the forum's return to Africa after 16 years, organisers said yesterday.

GSK pays $1.4b for HIV treatments,GlaxoSmithKline has ended a frenetic week for the pharmaceutical sector with a $1.4 billion takeover of HIV drug development assets from Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,2015-12-21,The Daily Star,"GlaxoSmithKline has ended a frenetic week for the pharmaceutical sector with a $1.4 billion takeover of HIV drug development assets from Bristol-Myers Squibb. ViiV Healthcare, GlaxoSmith-Klines HIV business, will acquire two operations specialising in late stage treatments and early phase medicines. It is the latest acquisition in a record year for pharmaceuticals. Global deals have reached $677.5 billion, according to Dealogic, up 64 percent on 2014. Healthcare companies have been forced to buy or swap assets to bolster growing areas of their businesses and shore up their defences as generic versions of previously patented medicines are released in the market. Sales of Advair, an asthma treatment and a bestseller for GSK, are expected to decline following the introduction of a generic version in the US. In the first nine months of the year, GSK reported that sales of Advair fell 19 percent to £1.2 billion, whereas sales of HIV treatments rose 56 percent to £1.6 billion. The company had considered spinning off its 80 percent stake in ViiV Healthcare through a flotation that could have valued the business at £18 billion. However, it decided to hang on to the operation in May. GSK said it would make an upfront payment of $317 million to buy Bristol-Myers Squibbs late stage HIV drugs, with a further $518 million dependent on sales and royalties. The assets include Fostemsavir, which treats HIV infection and is at the final phase three development stage. That means that it can seek regulatory approval, which is expected to be filed in 2018. It will also pay an initial $33 million to acquire pre-clinical and early stage research assets and could hand over $587 million if certain development and sales goals are met. Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said it would spend $4 billion to buy a 55 percent stake in Acerta Pharma, a US-Dutch company which is developing a leukaemia treatment that is at the phase three stage. It has an option to buy the remaining 45 percent in the company. AstraZeneca, which last year saw off a £69 billion takeover bid from US rival Pfizer, also announced it would acquire a number of respiratory medicines from Japans Takeda for $575 million. This year has been marked with major deals in the pharmaceuticals sector. Last month, Pfizer announced a $160 billion merger with Botox-maker Allergen while in March, GSK said it would swap its cancer drugs portfolio with Novartis vaccines business.",{},"['assets', 'gsk', 'buy', 'healthcare', 'million', 'hiv', '14b', 'stage', 'billion', 'phase', 'sales', 'medicines', 'treatments', 'pays']","GlaxoSmithKline has ended a frenetic week for the pharmaceutical sector with a $1.4 billion takeover of HIV drug development assets from Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Body's anti-HIV 'training manual' offers vaccine hopes,,,2013-04-04,The Daily Star,"This photo has been taken from BBC. The bodys own ""training manual"" for successfully attacking HIV has been recorded by scientists and it is hoped it can be used to design vaccines. HIV mutates in order to survive the onslaught of a patients immune system. However, some patients develop highly effective antibodies that can neutralise huge swathes of HIV mutants. An analysis of the arms race between body and virus, published in the journal Nature, has shown how these antibodies are made. When someone is infected with HIV, their body produces antibodies to attack it. But the virus mutates and evades the offensive, so the body produces new antibodies that the virus then evades and the war goes on. However, after about four years of this struggle some patients hit on to a winner by targeting something the virus finds harder to change - an Achilles heel. ""Even though the virus mutates and there are literally millions of quasi-species of virus because of all these mutations, but there are parts the virus cant change otherwise the virus cannot infect - these are the vulnerable sites,"" Prof Barton Haynes, of Duke University, in North Carolina, told the BBC. At this stage of the infection it is far too late to make a difference for the patient as the virus is hiding in untouchable reservoirs. However, some researchers believe that vaccines that encourage the body to produce these ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" may give people immunity to the virus. Super antibody The research teams study is based on a patient in Africa who had a rapid diagnosis, about four weeks after being infected with the virus. They were eventually able to produce an antibody named CH103 that could neutralise 55% of HIV samples. It was not produced in one easy step. Rather it was the product of the war of the immune system and HIV trying to out-evolve each other. However, through regular genetic analyses of both the immune system and virus, researchers could piece together each of the steps that culminated in the production of CH103. It is like a training manual for the immune system. Prof Haynes said: ""What we were able to do was map out the arms race of both virus and antibody, and in doing so we have now a map. ""This is the first time weve been able to see the actual road map."" He said the challenge now was to see if re-creating those steps could lead to a viable vaccine. However, he said it would almost certainly need to be a vaccine combining multiple ""Achilles heels"" - in the same way that HIV therapies are a combination of drug treatments. Prof Jane Anderson, consultant at Homerton hospital in London and chair of the British HIV Association, said: ""The study gives important insights into the ways in which the human immune system responds to HIV infection and increases our understanding about the relationships between the virus and the human host. ""This is another welcome step on the path to develop vaccines against HIV."" Dr Sarah Joseph, who tests HIV vaccines at the Medical Research Council clinical trials unit, said: ""This paper is really interesting. Some people do make antibodies that neutralise a lot of HIV virus, bit it is not of use to them as they produce it way too late."" She said harnessing these antibodies ""could be a big deal"" and there was ""even talk about mass-producing antibodies and infusing people with them"".",{},"['virus', 'hopes', 'antihiv', 'offers', 'manual', 'immune', 'training', 'body', 'system', 'hiv', 'vaccine', 'produce', 'neutralise', 'bodys', 'vaccines', 'antibodies', 'patients']","The body's own ""training manual"" for successfully attacking HIV has been recorded by scientists and it is hoped it can be used to design vaccines.

The press release said Roches dedicated team from its headquarters in Switzerland will work onsite to build facilities at all four locations for the transfer of technology to take place. The companies will be able to produce Saquinavir, an antiretroviral drug, for supply throughout countries in the sub-Saharan Africa and to those defined as least developed by the United Nations, it said. Since its launch two years ago, Roche signed technology transfer agreements with nine companies across sub-Saharan Africa and the worlds Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

Leadership is a must to combat the scourge,,,2007-12-01,The Daily Star,"World Aids Day is a day to celebrate a shared hope that we can thrash the global AIDS pandemic and that we can make AIDS history. According to AFAIDS, 2007, UNAIDS estimates there are nearly 40 million people living with HIV, including 2.3 million children. During 2006 some 4.3 million people became newly infected with the virus. Around half of all people who become infected with HIV become so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35. Around 95 percent of the people with HIV/AIDS live in developing nations. Bangladesh has been recognised as one of the five countries in Asia, where HIV/AIDS infections are increasing according to 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP8) 2007 in Colombo. Bangladesh is a country of 150 million. Although Bangladesh is a low prevalence country for HIV/AIDS, all the factors that may allow rapid spread of infection leading to an epidemic are present here. These factors include poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, proximity, malnutrition, unemployment, slum housing, family fragility, physical and sexual abuse, high prevalence of STIs, sharing injecting equipment, high-risk behaviour, lack of awareness and knowledge (lack of proper communication strategy), very mobile populations, human trafficking into prostitution, stigmatisation of those infected, conservative social attitudes, and being surrounded by countries that have a higher prevalence. Sharing injecting equipment increases the HIV risk. In addition increased number of migrant workers (there is evidence of HIV transmission to wives from their husbands after their return from abroad), unsafe practice in health service, unsafe sex practice, low lack of voluntary blood donors and dependence on professional blood sellers further increase the risk. Our current situation According to government statistics, a cumulative total of 874 cases of HIV/AIDS had been confirmed and reported as of 31st December 2006. A total of 240 AIDS cases were detected so far of which 109 had already died. A government survey found that out of 216 new HIV positive cases identified in 2006, unemployed people were on top of the list at 39.35 per cent followed by housewives at 21.29 per cent and businessmen at 10.18 per cent. Injecting drug users (IDU) in Dhaka are at high risk of HIV/AIDS, according to new study by ICDDR,B. HIV prevalence in Dhaka has dramatically risen to 7 percent from 1.7 percent in last six years. Sharing of injection equipment is common in most IDU surveyed. The IDU are not isolated as they have sex partners, both commercial and non-commercial, they rarely use condoms and some sell blood. IDU are also mobile traveling from one city to another and sharing injection equipment in different cities. Mobility is major factor that increases the risk of acquiring and spreading HIV infection among the non-drug users. The adolescent and youth are also vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. A survey among adolescents and young people (15-24 years) in 2005 revealed that only one out of 3 males in urban and 1 out of 4 in rural areas had correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Nearly 59 per cent of married women and 42 per cent of men of 15-54 age group have no knowledge as how to avoid HIV. Future priorities Mandatory testing for HIV infection is common in many countries before traveling and those returning from countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Bangladesh should follow these norms. To prevent a major epidemic, Bangladesh needs to address HIV/AIDS using a multi-pronged strategy: first, formulating the national HIV/AIDS communication strategy; secondly, concentrating on groups most vulnerable to the infection; thirdly, working with the general population (community mobilisation and community supports); and fourthly, care and support to those already infected and affected by HIV/AIDS have to be provided (voluntary counseling). Dissemination and advocacy can also play a big role. We need to change our society through public policy research, public awareness, increased funding, and community education. Above all Bangladesh should immediately translate its HIV/AIDS policies into action to benefit the people and for that reason we need strong and an effective leadership. Otherwise HIV/AIDS will destroy the economic growth of the country. We the inhabitants of this planet are to work hard together to control this scourge because to conquer AIDS any where, it must be conquered everywhere- Late J.

The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 4 Num 59,,,,,"Call for regional cooperation to check trafficking in women, children Expressing concern over the alarming rate of trafficking in women and children, they said this growing trend would push the country towards more vulnerable position in terms of AIDS contamination. Health and Family Welfare Minister Dr. Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain inaugurated the two-day conference on Interrelation between Trafficking in Women and Children and HIV/AIDS: South Asian Perspective, organised by the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA). The minister said a large number of women and children are being trafficked to India, Pakistan and the Middle East countries. And most of them got affected by HIV/AIDS as they are forced to prostitution, slavery and sex slavery, he added. The minister emphasised the need for raising awareness about the deadly disease to check its spread as Bangladesh has been identified as high-risk country. The government has set up 98 centres for blood screening to prevent the spread of AIDS, he added. Major General Dr. ASM Matiur Rahman said the women and children become more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS after being trafficked to another country as they do not have control over their profession and working environment. Several socio-economic factors like poverty, low-level of literacy, gender inequality, high density of population, and increased mobility made the South Asian region more vulnerable to AIDS epidemic, he said. He called for proper law enforcement, gender equality and empowerment of women to reduce the vulnerability of women and children to HIV/AIDS. In his keynote paper, Prof. Nazrul Islam of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University said that Bogra, Brahmanbaria, Chapainawabganj, Coxs Bazar, Dhaka, Dinajpur, Gopalganj, Jessore, Lalmonirhat, Mymensingh, Narayanganj and Satkhira have been identified as areas from where the women and children are picked up. He said India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bhutan are also facing the trafficking problem and organised crime syndicates are involved in this crime. Ashok K Rao of Freedom Foundation, India, emphasised the need for proper rehabilitation of the trafficking survivors. He said that HIV-positive people face stigma, discrimination and exploitation in the society and they are deprived of human rights. He called for showing more sympathetic attitude towards them.

Graft-accused NGO set to get big project,,,2012-04-30,The Daily Star,"The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has recommended a local NGO for an HIV/AIDS prevention project worth Tk 24 crore even though three reputed organisations have terminated contracts with the NGO for indulging in corruption. Save the Children terminated its contract with Padakhep Manabik Unnayan Kendra (PMUK) on November 24 last year after financial irregularities and fraudulence were detected in an HIV/AIDS prevention project funded by The Global Fund. Save the Children, the principal recipient of the fund, was implementing the project through PMUK. On suspicion of corruption, The Global Fund in September last year probed and found that PMUK had forged bank statements and submitted fake documents to Save the Children to hide misappropriation and improper use of funds. Save the Children ceased all activities of the project immediately after the discovery. The Global Fund endorsed the termination and so did Bangladesh Country Coordination Mechanism, chaired by the health minister. Brac and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime Control also stopped funding PMUK in two projects. But health ministry officials, especially the seven-member tender evaluation committee (TEC) as a whole, bothered little about PMUKs corruption. Despite objection from a few members of the committee, PMUK was recommended for the project. As per the projects tender document, the bid of PMUK could have been rejected. Clause-5.5 of the tender document reads, “A consistent history of litigation or arbitration against the applicant or any partner of a joint venture may result in disqualification.” Sources claimed that a few officials of the ministry insisted on qualifying and recommending PMUK for the government project for their own benefits, which is believed to be monetary. “Two officials played a key role in qualifying PMUK. Some ministry officials warned them of disastrous consequences, but they were desperate to give the job to PMUK,” a top official told The Daily Star on condition of anonymity. Additional Director General of the Directorate of Health Services Saiful Islam, who is heading the TEC, said they had not taken the allegation of corruption against PMUK into consideration as the matter was pending with a court. “You cant term one corrupt, unless he is proved so in the court,” he insisted. PMUK has filed a case against the termination of its contract with Save the Children. Line Director of National AIDS/STD Programme Abdul Wahid, an influential member of TEC, echoed Director General Saiful Islam. He claimed that everything had been done following the Word Bank guidelines and the Public Procurement Rules 2008. Executive Director of PMUK Iqbal Ahammed avoided talking to The Daily Star on the issue. When called, he said he would call back in half an hour, but he never did. He did not even pick up the phone when The Daily Star called him several times afterwards. Health Minister AFM Ruhal Haque is well aware of PMUKs corruption, as the issue dominated different meetings, including the last one of Bangladesh Country Coordination Mechanism on February 2. The minister himself chaired the meeting which endorsed Save the Childrens termination of contract with PMUK. Country Director of Save the Children Michael McGrath shared some evidence of financial irregularities committed by PMUK at the meeting. According to the meeting minutes, he informed the meeting that PMUK had denied Save the Children and The Global Fund access to information and bank records. He also said PMUK had submitted fake documents, including quotations and bank documents. Faruque Ahmed, director of Brac Health Programme, informed the meeting that Brac had discontinued grants to PMUK in a project for fighting tuberculosis after corruption had been detected in Save the Childrens project. He said PMUK had to return the unspent money and assets of the project to Brac. The Global Fund had also paid for the tuberculosis project of Brac. Participants of the meeting were of the view that all should be more vigilant in monitoring financial issues and develop a system of transparency and accountability to prevent corruption and financial loss. The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime Control (UNODCC) had employed PMUK for an HIV/AIDS awareness programme among inmates of Jessore and Khulna central jails. The UNODCC was unsatisfied with PMUKs performance and after the discovery of its corruption, it terminated funding for the project, the UNODCC sources said. On October 28 last year, Fund Portfolio Manager of The Global Fund Artashes Mirzoyan wrote to the health minister, the health secretary and other senior officials concerned informing them of the wrongdoings by PMUK. The letter requested the health ministry to support Save the Children for uninterrupted continuation of HIV prevention services to most-at-risk groups in Bangladesh. The Directorate General of Health Services in January this year floated a tender for the “procurement of HIV/AIDS prevention services for injecting drug users”. Under the project, new syringes were supposed to be given to those who share syringes to take drugs. The drug users were also supposed to be made aware of HIV/AIDS among other diseases. Four consortiums of local NGOs bided for the project. The PMUK along with Social Advancement Service bid Tk 18.39 lakh for the project. A consortium comprising of Khulna Mukti Saba Sangstha (KMSS), Dhaka Ahsania Mission and Samaj Kalyan O Unnayan Sangstha bid Tk 18.56 crore and Light House and Marie Stopes bid Tk 22 crore. Microcredit NGO Peoples Oriented Programme Implementation also bid for the job. PMUK made the lowest bid, Light House second lowest as KMSS was disqualified on grounds of lacking the experience required. However, KMSS brought allegation of unfair evaluation against the TEC. It also lodged complaints against the TEC with the health minister, the health secretary and the World Bank. “We submitted documents to prove our experience in the field but the TEC did not consider,” said Afroza Akhter Monju, executive director of KMSS. The Global Fund launched a comprehensive investigation into the activities of Bangladeshi NGOs running projects with its money. The investigation is underway. Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), said the health sector is one of the most corrupt sectors in the country. He was surprised to know that PMUK was qualified and recommended for a project. “Minister, secretary and many other officials of the health ministry are very much aware about the PMUKs corruption. The ministry should not select such a corrupt institution for its project,” he told The Daily Star.",{},"['pmuk', 'big', 'health', 'project', 'ngo', 'corruption', 'save', 'children', 'set', 'graftaccused', 'fund', 'director', 'ministry', 'global']","The Global Fund endorsed the termination and so did Bangladesh Country Coordination Mechanism, chaired by the health minister.

First gene-edited babies claimed in China,A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life.,,2018-11-26,The Daily Star,"A Chinese researcher claims that he helped make the world’s first genetically edited babies — twin girls born this month whose DNA he said he altered with a powerful new tool capable of rewriting the very blueprint of life. If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics. A US scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes. Many mainstream scientists think it’s too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation. The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus. He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done. There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press. “I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He told the AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science. Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it. It’s “unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal. “This is far too premature,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. “We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal.” However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat.” “I think this is justifiable,” Church said of that goal. In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems. It’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it’s not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing. He Jiankui (HEH JEE’-an-qway), who goes by “JK,” studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies. The US scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He’s two companies. The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods. He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell. All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes. Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate. He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym “Bai Hua,” told the AP that it’s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed. Here is how He described the work: The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added. When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said. Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do. Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm. They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes. “It’s almost like not editing at all” if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said. Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered. “In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you’re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,” Musunuru said. The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ “main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,” Church said. Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it’s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said. There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials. It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program. The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he “absolutely” thinks they were able to understand the risks. Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine. “That might be a layman’s way of describing it,” he said. Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials. The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they’re adults. Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a “first” was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered. He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts. Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants’ HIV infection from being disclosed. “We think this is ethical,” said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel. Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He’s lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts. The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.” “I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”",{},"['embryos', 'risks', 'human', 'babies', 'china', 'claimed', 'gene', 'geneedited', 'hiv', 'chinese', 'pregnancy', 'research', 'participants', 'editing']","China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.

Photo: Star Unmarried adolescents making up nearly one-fourth of Bangladeshs population have no access to formal healthcare services on preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, said a high official of Directorate General of Family Planning (DGFP) yesterday. Addressing a discussion, Dr Ishrat Jahan, programme manager of Adolescent and Reproductive Health at DGFP, said the adolescents, aged 10 to 19 years, have no legal option to deal with unwanted pregnancies either. Fighting HIV infection in a comprehensive manner remains an unanswered challenge prompting a large section of the sexually active population to resort to informal and dangerous medical courses to cope with the situation, she said. Condoms must be promoted as an easy and effective measure with the dual purpose of birth control and STD prevention, she added. The Daily Star jointly with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) organised the discussion on integrated prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on reproductive health at The Daily Star Centre in the capital. Combining HIV infection prevention with family planning and regular healthcare services is a must to keep a low prevalence of AIDS in the country, said Dr Khandker Ezazul Haque, a technical officer of UNFPA. HIV screening must be a part of family planning, maternity and child healthcare services to encourage easy screening of the deadly virus, said Dr Halida H Khandker, executive director of Confidential Approach to AIDS Prevention. HIV service integration with regular healthcare must keep in mind the around 70 million youths constituting 60 percent of Bangladeshs population, said Kazi Ali Reza, officer-in-charge of United Nations Information Centre.

Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise,,,2007-12-02,The Daily Star,"The theme for World AIDS Day 2007 celebrated yesterday was focused on leadership, under the slogan, ""Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise,"" which is the worldwide campaign until 2010. This years theme of leadership encourages you to ""Take the Lead"" in responding to key issues surrounding HIV/AIDS issues such as stigma and discrimination; access to medicines and better prevention, treatment, support and care. Leaders with vision, passion, and perseverance, who lead with personal engagement, inspire others to become engaged and make a huge difference in the response of communities to and are better example in the response to HIV/AIDS. This type of leader is not stuck in a government office; this type of leader is found in your homes, your religious houses, your schools, and your offices. At home, in schools, at workplaces or worship spaces, you can ""Take the Lead"" in a compassionate, active and effective response to AIDS. Youth are the future leaders. Involvement of youth in AIDS programme whether it is awareness raising or any kind of activity is stressed by world leader. Here is the recommendation that includes four Strategy of Action for youth involvement. 1.Advocacy and presentation of action plan to immediate community gate-keepers/stakeholders 2.Mobilisation of resources within immediate community 3.Finalisation of modality and sequence of implementation 4.Commemorating the World AIDS Day. Therefore, as a youth, either young-young youth, old-young youth, or young-old youth, you should get involved yourself in your own capacity. There are programmes you can design in line with the theme, based on your community needs assessment, and the stakeholders’ analysis. World Scenario -According to latest statistics from WHO/UN, AIDS has killed more than 25 million people and an estimated 33.2 million people all over the world are living with HIV. -Out of this 30% are women and 10% are children(below 15 years). -Despite the improved access to ARV treatment and care, the AIDS epidemic is killing at least 5700 people per day all over the world. -Despite rampant awareness 6800 people are getting infected everyday all over the world. Bangladesh Scenario -In December 2006, the GoB reported that 874 people were living with HIV/AIDS in the country, with a total of 240 AIDS cases. -However, UNAIDS reported in June 2007 there were some 11,000 people living with HIV. -HIV has turned into concentrated epidemic among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), which reported 7 percent.

A challenging perspective,,,2010-04-08,The Daily Star,"FOR the first time in more than 35 years since Aids was identified the epidemic seems to have been arrested, according to the 2009 epidemic data. One of the major contributing factors for the reduction is the United Nations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/Aids signed in 2001. However, the diminishing rate of infection is just the tip of the iceberg and has not fully revealed the socio-economic consequences of HIV/Aids epidemic disrupting the productive flow of life. It is now established that HIV/Aids is not merely a health concern because its expansion encompasses all the dimensions unique to the individual it infects, the family it affects and the community that it impacts -- as such each epidemic is different. Therefore, the new paradigm for addressing HIV/Aids is to ""know your epidemic."" Declining trend of infection in one region cannot fully provide the global scenario as there are now an estimated 40 million HIV/Aids cases in the world. In 2008 alone 2.7 million new infections occurred and 2 million people died of Aids related illness. Fortunately, for Bangladesh, a ""high risk and low prevalence country,"" the national HIV/Aids program is prepared to contain it. It has progressed extensively, covering the various aspects of prevention, care and support and treatment. But Bangladesh, besieged by a myriad of socio-economic concerns, requires pre-emptive measures that must focus on evolving issues for immediate redress. The correlation between climate change and HIV/Aids may be an atypical notion, but the United Nations Millennium Development Goal integrating HIV/Aids as a development agenda suggests that global organisations are taking cognisance of the environment of risk determined by poverty and climate change impact. The most pervasive result of climate change and environment degradation is population displacement. Research findings show that the growth of environmental displacement in Bangladesh is likely to be close to about half of total population in 2020. Bangladesh is exposed to severe natural disasters; floods and droughts are regular phenomena that force people to migrate from rural to urban settings. They end up as climate refugees in the streets and proliferating urban slums. This influx has resulted in rapid and unplanned urbanisation in Bangladesh. According to International Organisation for Migration, Bangladesh, urban population may reach about 68 million, or 37 percent of the total population, by 2015. A substantive proportion of this segment becomes chronically mobile in search of work and subsistence. This landless and homeless mass merges with the existing ultra-poor, resulting in population increase in urban slums and burgeoning poverty. Evidence shows that HIV/Aids and poverty move in a vicious cycle of cause and effect and, therefore, the global efforts for containing the epidemic focus on poverty as a significant determinant for its spread. Population density mixed with poverty is the recipe for any communicable disease to spread. HIV/Aids is described as more of an urban phenomenon, hence the situation is conducive for an epidemic to set in. For Bangladesh this is very alarming. The revised National HIV/Aids strategy puts emphasis on the external migrant labour work force as a vulnerable segment and identifies this group as being the most at risk. But the majority of the people internally displaced due to climate change related factors remain outside the social security and HIV/Aids prevention program. NGOs, civil society and grassroots organisations are making efforts to reach the climate refugees in the urban streets and slums but, without a national policy and coordination of the government machinery, these endeavours remain sporadic and isolated. The national HIV/Aids program is a well coordinated mechanism engaging the stakeholders and developing innovative approaches for visible impact. For the first time, HIV/Aids prevention awareness has broken the denial and silence barrier in the country through mass media. This progress runs the risk of failure if the program does not acknowledge the multiplying challenges. The standard way of preventing and containing communicable disease is ""early warning rapid response system,"" which has to reach all, with focus on the high-risk segment. The national program effectively launched this design. Now the emphasis should be on strengthening the integrated approach to initiate the discourse on climate change and HIV/Aids from the perspective of ""climigration,"" and capture the most vulnerable, under-served and increasing number of people. In 2007, Bangladesh launched a National Action plan aimed at reducing the disease burden from current and projected risks due to climate change by empowering and equipping health system institutions in the country. Hence, there is no reason to delay the inclusion of climate change and environment degradation related displaced population. The 7th Round of National Serological Surveillance shows that there is a concentrated epidemic amongst the injecting drug users and in one locality within Dhaka 10.5 percent of injecting drug users where found to be HIV positive. Increasing poverty due to the impact of global economic recession, increase in climate related migration and accelerated mobility of population may change the course of the still low prevalence status and silently develop it into a generalised epidemic. Time is of the essence in addressing HIV/Aids ""right now, right here and in the right way."" Health research per se and HIV/Aids surveillance, specially at the national level, needs to widen their scope to find out the implications of climate change for future impacts on health and related issues, and develop a tiered health service system strengthening process that is dynamic, flexible, manageable and sustainable to address the evolving needs. Most importantly the government needs to focus on resettlement strategies and their implementation, mobilising the available resources and integrating them systematically into multi-sector operations. There has to be a concerted political will and effort to reach beyond the traditional frameworks of treating the root causes of HIV/Aids.

New AIDS drug shields monkeys: Study,"Scientists say new drug tested on monkeys provided astonishingly effective shield against animal version of AIDS, major gain in the quest for an HIV vaccine",,2015-02-19,The Daily Star,"Scientists said Wednesday a new drug tested on monkeys provided an astonishingly effective shield against an animal version of the AIDS virus, a major gain in the quest for an HIV vaccine. Macaque monkeys given the drug were able to fend off high repeated doses of the simian version of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they reported in the journal Nature. ""We... show a way to achieve long-lived, effective, vaccine-like protection from HIV 1,"" the main group of viral strains in humans, said study leader Michael Farzan, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida. The prototype drug, called eCD4-Ig, comprises two imitations of the receptors, or docking points, where HIV latches on to CD4 cells -- the key defences of the immune cells. The mimics latch on to the virus, tricking it into prematurely launching the docking procedure. The virus can only execute the procedure once, rendering it unable to attach to CD4 cells thereafter. The scientists likened the effect to closing the door to an intruder and tossing away the key. The drug provides ""very, very strong protection,"" Farzan told AFP by email. The paper reported on a 40-week experiment which showed that inoculated animals thrived even after being injected with four times the dose needed to infect macaques in a ""control"" group. Further research, to be unveiled at a conference in Seattle next week, found that the treated macaques ""continue to be protected from eight times and 16 times the infectious dose, more than a year after inoculation,"" Farzan said. The search for a vaccine has been one of the most frustrating chapters of the AIDS saga. A new compound has blocked HIV infection so well in monkeys that it may be able to function as a vaccine against AIDS http://t.co/I1cxR9AsM0 — The New York Times (@nytimes) February 18, 2015 Traditional antibody-based vaccine candidates have failed to put up more than a partial shield, partly because of mutations in the stealthy virus. The new prototype formula, though, targets sites on the virus so-called Env entry protein that are ""highly conserved"" -- a scientific term meaning that these sites do not mutate very much. Lab-dish tests have found that the drug also works on human HIV, which is very close to the simian version of the virus. ""Unlike antibodies, which fail to neutralise a large fraction of HIV-1 strains, our protein has been effective against all strains tested, raising the possibility it could offer an effective HIV vaccine alternative,"" said Farzan. He cautioned: ""Of course, we still need to do further safety studies in both macaques and humans"" before any trials can take place. Since 1981, about 78 million people have been infected by HIV, which destroys immune cells and leaves the body exposed to tuberculosis, pneumonia and other opportunistic diseases. Thirty-nine million have died, according to UN estimates. Treatment burden Antiretroviral drugs, invented in the mid-1990s, can treat infection, but cannot cure it or prevent it. Treatment is lifelong, carries side effects and for many health systems, the drugs bill is spiralling, said Anthony Fauci, head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH), whose parent organisation funded the research. ""This innovative research marks an important step toward our goal of putting HIV into sustained remission in chronically-infected people,"" Fauci said in a press release. The approach behind eCD4-Ig is based on the idea that two is better than one. Separately, the two mimics are not effective, but together they are. They are delivered into the body inside a harmless adenovirus that is used extensively in medical research. Once injected into muscle tissue, the virus uses cells to crank out the protective protein, in quantities that could last for years.",{},"['shields', 'virus', 'times', 'cells', 'version', 'hiv', 'effective', 'drug', 'vaccine', 'strains', 'monkeys', 'aids', 'research', 'study']","Scientists said Wednesday a new drug tested on monkeys provided an astonishingly effective shield against an animal version of the AIDS virus, a major gain in the quest for an HIV vaccine.

Corporate bodies urged to help prevent HIV/AIDS,,,2012-01-26,The Daily Star,"Corporate bodies should come forward to help prevent HIV/AIDS through raising mass awareness among people more vulnerable to the deadly infectious disease, business leaders and health experts said yesterday. Garment workers were among many other groups vulnerable to the disease and they required special attention, they said at a national seminar titled “Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in Preventing HIV/AIDS”. Marie Stopes and Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) organised the seminar at a city hotel, says a press release. BGMEA President Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin urged the local initiatives to team up with foreign organisations to help prevent HIV/AIDS. Appreciating the initiative of the BGMEA, Global Fund and Save the Children for implementing a project on prevention of HIV/AIDS through workplace interventions, Marie Stopes Country Management Consultant Anil P Tambay said BGMEA should continue its effort to prevent the disease in garment factories that contribute to the national economy through earning foreign currency.

The roundtable titled Fighting AIDS and Role of Leadership was organised by the Prothom Alo at its conference room in association with Grameen Phone, Asia Pacific Leadership Forum and UNAIDS on the eve of the World AIDS Day today. ""As of last year, 123 people died of AIDS, 365 others got infected and 1207 found HIV positive,"" said Abul Kalam Azad, additional secretary to health ministry, adding that the first HIV positive patient in the country was identified in 1989. The prevalence of HIV infection is still lower in Bangladesh than any country of the region, but there is nothing to be complacent about it because there is every element that can turn the situation worse, cautioned the health experts and civil society members at the programme. They said the drug users and sex workers are the most risky groups to spread HIV, but the efforts to free youths from drug addiction and to supply adequate condoms to brothels are not adequate. They emphasised that the authorities should frame a pragmatic policy on HIV/AIDs, while the government, NGOs and donors must join hands to formulate an action plan to create massive awareness, provide care and support to infected people and reduce the increasing rate of infection by 2015. ""A national policy on HIV/AIDS was drafted in 1991, but is yet to see the light.

Law & Our Rights,,,,,"HIV/AIDS & Human Rights ""The goal of realizing human rights is fundamental to the global fight against AIDS. And in a world facing a terrible epidemic - one that has already spread further, faster and to more devastating effect than any other in human history - winning the fight against AIDS is a precondition for achieving rights worth enjoying."" - Dr Peter Piot, UNAIDS Executive Director Several years of experience in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic have confirmed that the promotion and protection of human rights constitute an essential component in preventing transmission of HIV, reducing vulnerability to infection and the impact of HIV/AIDS. However, in practice: Fundamental human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, such as the right to non-discrimination, equal protection and equality before the law, privacy, liberty of movement, work, equal access to education, housing, health care, social security, assistance and welfare, are often violated based on their known or presumed HIV/AIDS status. Lack of respect for human rights continues to increase vulnerability to HIV infection of individuals and the whole society. Individuals or groups who suffer discrimination and lack of human rights protection are both more vulnerable to becoming infected and less able to cope with the burdens of HIV/AIDS. Refugees, migrants, prisoners, men who have sex with men, sex workers and injecting drug users may be more vulnerable to contracting HIV because they often are unable to realize their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Further, gender inequalities spur on the spread of the epidemic and its disproportionate impact on women. The response to the HIV epidemic is hindered due to lack of enjoyment of freedoms of speech and association; the right to information and education by infected and affected groups, and the civil society at large. Respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights is central to the AIDS agenda, and equally, HIV/AIDS needs to be at the centre of the global human rights agenda.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis found safe and effective for widespread use,New research presented at the HIV Drug Therapy Conference in Glasgow recently shows that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could be given to millions of people worldwide with no increased risk of safety issues during treatment.,,2018-11-04,The Daily Star,"New research presented at the HIV Drug Therapy Conference in Glasgow recently shows that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could be given to millions of people worldwide with no increased risk of safety issues during treatment. PrEP is a combination of two drugs that people can take before sex to prevent HIV infection. Existing evidence shows that people who take tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) as PrEP have a 90% lower chance of being infected with HIV than people not taking it. However, widespread use of TDF/FTC can be justified only if its preventative benefits outweigh potential risks of safety issues. These new results show that PrEP is safe to use. The researchers undertook a meta-analysis of 13 randomised trials with 15,678 participants. People at risk of HIV infection were given either TDF/FTC as PrEP or no treatment (the control, or placebo). There was no significant difference in risk of high grade or serious adverse events comparing PrEP with control. The risk of serious adverse events was almost the same for both groups: 9.4% for those on PrEP and 10.1% for those on placebo. There was also no significant difference in risk of renal or bone adverse outcomes. The risk of bone fractures was 3.7% on PrEP versus 3.3% on no treatment. The risk of significant renal dysfunction was 0.1% on PrEP and 0.1% for no treatment. “In 2016, there were 1.8 million new HIV infections worldwide and the same number again in 2017,” International AIDS Society President Anton Pozniak said. “Across a range of studies, men who have sex with men have one in 30 chance of contracting HIV in a year. Other particularly vulnerable populations’, such as people who inject drugs or sex workers, have a one in 50 chance of being infected with HIV. “Worldwide, there are only 300,000 people estimated to be taking PrEP. This is far too small a number to prevent 1.8 million new HIV infections. Clearly, to have a significant effect on the HIV epidemic, we need to scale up PrEP to reach tens of millions of people worldwide.” Other PrEP modalities, such as long-acting injectable drugs and antibodies, are being tested in order to offer more choices of how PrEP could be taken. “Globally, there is a new HIV infection every 18 seconds,” study co-author Dr Andrew Hill, from Liverpool University, said. “Every person newly infected will then need to be treated for life, and could transmit HIV to others. We need radical changes in our prevention strategy to cut new HIV infections down to zero.” The most widely used PrEP, a combination of TDF and FTC, costs only £40 per year to make. A generic TDF/FTC course is available in the UK for £300 per year and £50 in sub-Saharan Africa. With recent legal rulings, low-cost, generic PrEP is becoming more available. This provides an opportunity, with the decreasing costs making it increasingly feasible to provide PrEP to millions of people at risk of HIV worldwide. “The World Health Organisation updated its official guidelines in 2015 to include the use of PrEP as a prevention method,” Dr. Pozniak commented. “The data is clear and it’s time to globally implement this recommendation.” These results are supported by another recent analysis, which showed no difference in adverse events between TDF/FTC and a combination of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and FTC when taken for treatment with an additional antiviral drug.",{},"['prep', 'widespread', 'tdfftc', 'adverse', 'safe', 'effective', 'hiv', 'significant', 'need', 'sex', 'prophylaxis', 'risk', 'millions', 'treatment', 'preexposure']","PrEP is a combination of two drugs that people can take before sex to prevent HIV infection.

Global commitment needed to combat AIDS: Moriarty,,,2009-11-25,The Daily Star,"US Ambassador James Moriarty yesterday said the global community must recommit to working together to combat global AIDS as WHO estimates that over four million individuals in low and middle-income countries currently have access to antiretroviral treatment. In a statement marking the World AIDS Day, he said the US government, through the United States Agency for International Development, supports a $14 million health initiative called “Modhumita” to stem the transmission of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh. “Modhumita” programme prevents HIV by providing HIV-prevention services to two million at-risk people in this country. The programme provides these services through a network of 54 health centres that offer voluntary counseling and HIV testing and provide treatment and preventive services for sexually transmitted infections. Moriarty said in addition to providing medical testing and treatment, the centres also rehabilitate injecting drug users, offer job skills training to recovering drug users, and deliver HIV awareness messages. The envoy said the American people through the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) support more than half of these men, women and children on treatment. “Together, we have also provided compassionate care for more than 10 million people affected by HIV/AIDS, including more than four million orphans and vulnerable children, “he said. Moriarty noted that US has also supported prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes that have allowed nearly 2,40,000 babies to be born HIV-free. Moriarty said the US will continue PEPFARs essential work as a critical component of the Global Health Initiative. However, he said the United States cannot defeat HIV/AIDS alone. For nations facing this epidemic, he said potential for success is compromised with each life lost to AIDS. “For this reason, we must continue to work with countries and our global partners to overcome the many barriers that still stand in our way,” he observed.",{},"['health', 'moriarty', 'combat', 'hivaids', 'work', 'commitment', 'million', 'services', 'hiv', 'users', 'united', 'aids', 'needed', 'global']","US Ambassador James Moriarty yesterday said the global community must recommit to working together to combat global AIDS as WHO estimates that over four million individuals in low and middle-income countries currently have access to antiretroviral treatment. “Modhumita” programme prevents HIV by providing HIV-prevention services to two million at-risk people in this country.

“AIDS Jaago”: Films that awaken,,,2009-12-06,The Daily Star,"What could be more opportune on World AIDS Day (December 1) this year than a series of short films by well-known Indian film directors that combine a socially relevant theme with gripping storylines? Thats a brief rundown of “AIDS Jaago” (AIDS Awaken), a series of four short dramatic films, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on HIV-AIDS, which were screened at the American Centre in New Delhi. The films: “Migration” (directed and produced by Mira Nair, of “Monsoon Wedding”, “Mississippi Masala” and The Namesake” fame), “Blood Brothers” (directed by Vishal Bhardwaj the award-winning filmmaker behind “Omkara”), “Positive” (by Farhan Akhtar, a most prominent young filmmaker) and “Prarambha” (The Beginning) by renowned cinematographer and director Santosh Sivan. What binds the films together is that each of them convey their message forcefully, without the didactic droning that such works are prone to. In “Migration” we have a star cast of Shiny Ahuja, Irrfan Khan, Sameera Reddy and Raima Sen (grand daughter of legendary actress Suchitra Sen). This Mira Nair film reveals the criss crossing of rural and urban India through the rural protagonist Shiny Ahuja who migrates to Mumbai in search of work. His life is changed forever after an encounter with a bored homemaker (ably played by Sameera Reddy) whose husband (Irrfan Khan) is a closet gay. He returns to his village and his young wife (Raima Sen) only to discover that he is HIV positive and that his newborn child has also contracted the deadly virus. The films carry nuances not only of agony and despair but also of hope and courage. Take “Blood Brothers”, for example. With Siddhartha (of “Rang de Basanti”), Pavan Malhotra, Ayesha Takia and Pankaj Kapur in the cast, we get to see how a young man with a positive HIV diagnosis (which turns out to be negative later) allows his life to fall to pieces, while another man whose file has got mixed up with the former, knows that his is HIV positive, yet carries on with optimism and courage. More than rallies and long-winded discussions, films of this calibre can go many miles in dealing with the stigma and discrimination that are conjoined with the disease. Director Mira Nair, the brain behind the “AIDS Jaago project, has been quoted as saying, “We cannot underestimate the potential of films to change behaviour and transform the world.” Needless to say, more such films that raise awareness on this blight and demolish the numerous myths that surround the disease are necessary. As recent figures indicate, an estimated 33 million people live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. India and Bangladesh are regarded as the hotspots for the disease. The “AIDS Jaago” series could strike a responsive chord in audiences in the subcontinent. They could also act as a clarion call to a complacent public that believes that HIV/AIDS is a distant threat and all victims pariahs of society.",{},"['nair', 'positive', 'hivaids', 'mira', 'sen', 'films', 'series', 'aids', 'young', 'awaken', 'jaago']","What could be more opportune on World AIDS Day (December 1) this year than a series of short films by well-known Indian film directors that combine a socially relevant theme with gripping storylines?

"Workshops on Hygiene, HIV, STD and more","In the heart of Mymensingh, there exists a dingy confined hallway, with little scope to even see the sky properly. The place is called Nazma Boarding Brothel. Among the twenty brothel-villages that are legal in the country, Nazma Boarding is one of them.",,2017-08-18,The Daily Star,"In the heart of Mymensingh, there exists a dingy confined hallway, with a little scope to even see the sky properly. The place is called Nazma Boarding Brothel. Among the twenty brothel-villages that are legal in the country, Nazma Boarding is one of them. The ugly truth is that a lot of sex-workers inside the brothel have little to no knowledge about HIV and STDs whereas they are most vulnerable to these diseases. To help this disregarded group of people in the society, Awareness 360, a non-profit youth organisation, held a health awareness campaign on 9 August 2017 at Nazma Boarding Brothel. Shomy Hasan Chowdhury and Rijve Arefin were the co-ordinators of the project called Make Brothels in Bangladesh Safe and it was funded by Global Changemakers. The first session of the workshop included awareness on hygiene. The road that led to the workshop stage from the entrance of the brothel was filled with garbage. Rijve Arefin explained the importance of maintaining hygiene and not to throw garbage on the road. In the second session, Shomy Hasan Chowdhury talked about menstrual hygiene. The sex-workers were encouraged to talk about menstruation, a natural part of the female body. They were assured that there was no need to feel ashamed of a natural process. Also, they were provided with free sanitary napkins and instructed not to throw them out in the open after using. Next, information regarding HIV, STDs were provided to the sex-workers. The risks of having unprotected sex, the importance of using condoms and symptoms of STDs and HIV were demonstrated to them. They were informed further about the risks of using unclean and used syringe and made aware of the fact that conceiving a child while having HIV would transmit the disease to the unborn child as well. The special guest at the workshop, Former National Advisor, Food Safety Program of FAO-UN and Senior Assistant Director of Department of Fisheries, Hasan Ahmmed Chowdhury, spoke about food protection. Nutrition is very important in fighting against disease. Hence, he advised them to eat healthy, keep the kitchen clean and eat in a clean place. He also told them to boil their water and dishes and be aware in order to prevent any unwanted illness. Along with these, pamphlets and posters were distributed that included six steps of washing hands properly. In the process, the organisers had to make sure the sex-workers did not get bored. Few performances from the sex-workers were also encouraged to make sure they had a good time. They sang and danced and enjoyed themselves. To organise a workshop inside a brothel was very challenging. One of the coordinators, Shomy Hasan Chowdhury says, “We found a local contact in Nazma Boarding Brothel and through him, we talked to their committee members. Convincing them was pretty tough. Arranging the whole programme, travelling to Mymensingh from Dhaka multiple times were even tougher. We needed to get permission from the District Commissioner of Mymensingh because without his consent we would not be able to get Police Protection. After struggling through a rigorous process we managed both.” It was a day long workshop and we had to come back to our regular lives, while they were still trapped in that cramped brothel. Many stories were left to be heard for another day. Therefore, more of such workshops are needed to be organised and attention to be paid.",{},"['workshops', 'workshop', 'sexworkers', 'hasan', 'stds', 'hiv', 'hygiene', 'std', 'brothel', 'nazma', 'chowdhury', 'shomy', 'boarding']","The place is called Nazma Boarding Brothel.

MH17 crash: 'Total shock' at Aids researcher deaths,,,2014-07-18,The Daily Star,"Prof Joep Lange Dozens of passengers who died on board the crashed Malaysia Airlines plane are thought to have been heading to a major international Aids conference. They include Prof Joep Lange - a prominent and popular researcher and a former president of the International Aids Society (IAS). IAS said they would have ""truly lost a giant"". Delegates, who have already arrived at the conference in Australia said they were in ""total shock"". More than 14,000 scientists, campaigners and politicians are meeting at the Aids 2014 conference, which starts in Melbourne at the weekend. GIANT Joep Lange, was a professor of medicine at the University of Amsterdam, and has been involved in HIV research since the virus first emerged in the 1980s. He trialled antiretroviral therapies, which have now transformed HIV into a manageable disease. He also worked on preventing the virus passing from mother to child during pregnancy and labour. Prof Lange is described as a leader in his field, and between 2002 and 2004 was the president of the International Aids Society. Prof Peter Riess, who also worked at the University of Amsterdam, told the BBC: ""Joep was a close colleague and friend of mine. Everyone here in Melbourne is in total shock at what happened. ""In the early eighties when this strange new disease hit Amsterdam, both Joep and I were training at the time and were confronted with this new disease which then went on to shape our scientific and medical careers. ""Hes been really involved from the very beginning."" GREAT LOSS The plane, carrying 298 people, crashed in rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine on Thursday. Prof Langes partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren, was also reportedly on board. Dr Jeremy Farrar who leads the Wellcome Trust medical research charity said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the the deaths on flight MH17. ""Joep was a great clinical scientist, and a great friend of the Wellcome Trust who has long been a valued adviser. ""He was also a personal friend. He is a great loss to global health research."" The International Aids Society said the conference would go ahead with ""opportunities to reflect and remember those we have lost"". It added: ""The IAS is hearing unconfirmed reports that some of our friends and colleagues were on board the flight and if that is the case this is a truly sad day. ""The IAS has also heard reports that among the passengers was a former IAS president Joep Lange and if that is the case then the HIV/Aids movement has truly lost a giant."" TERRIBLE LOSS Zoya Shabarova, an advisor for the Aids Healthcare Foundation, is flying to the conference via Hong Kong. She told the BBC: ""Its a really terrible loss, unbelievable, he was a person with such a big heart, my colleagues and I, we cant comprehend this its a terrible loss to the HIV programme, the people, the patients. ""I want to send deep condolences to his family & all those on the flight."" Another delegate, Glenn Thomas, a media spokesman from the World Health Organization (WHO), was also on board. WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said: ""For the time being we would like to give his family time to grieve. ""We have lost a wonderful person and a great professional. Our hearts are broken. We are all in shock."" Dr Peter MacPherson, an HIV researcher at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said so many HIV researchers were on the flight that everyone was worried that friends and colleague were on board. ""I couldnt believe it when I heard last night, Im not travelling to Melbourne, but I have a number of colleagues travelling. ""I really dont know how many people attending the conference have been lost. ""Im just hoping it is none of my colleagues and friends - emails are flying around, people are sending emails, looking on Twitter and Facebook to try and find out what has happened. Everyone lost is a tragedy."" ""The global HIV community is a close community - standing up for non-violence, dignity and human rights.

Bangladesh's community clinics could be a model,Global leaders and activists in the fight against AIDS consider Bangladesh's community clinics as an opportunity and a possible model to reduce HIV infection as part of a global agenda to eliminate the virus by 2030.,,2016-03-15,The Daily Star,"Global leaders and activists in the fight against AIDS consider Bangladeshs community clinics as an opportunity and a possible model to reduce HIV infection as part of a global agenda to eliminate the virus by 2030. There are some 11,000 community clinics at the grassroots level meant to provide maternal and neonatal, family planning and nutritional services and establish linkage with the medium and tertiary level hospitals. Adopting a “Dhaka Declaration” on the closing day yesterday, the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) said it recognises Bangladeshs community clinics as a model to provide services to reduce maternal mortality and “as an opportunity to reduce mother to child transmission of HIV as well”. The congress emphasised greater integration of HIV response with regular health systems, mainstreaming it in development programmes. It requested donors, governments and bi-lateral and multi-lateral organisations to invest adequately. ICAAP acknowledged that resource generation for AIDS response should not be an exclusive responsibility of developing countries. “Rather, it should be a global shared responsibility for which resources should be allocated based on the relative vulnerability of societies, rather than prevalence rates alone and accordingly cooperate for such resource generation,” said Bangladeshs State Minister for Health and Family Welfare Zahid Maleque while presenting the Dhaka declaration. The ministry and Partners in Population and Development organised the three-day event at International Convention City Bashundhara. Some 2,000 participants from across the globe attended. According to World Health Organization, there were approximately 36.9 million people, including 2.6 million children, worldwide living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2014. Besides, 34 million people died from AIDS-related causes so far, including 1.2 million in 2014. Government statistics say Bangladesh has registered 3,674 cases of HIV infection since detection of the first case in 1989. However, experts say the estimated number of people living with HIV is around 9,500, making Bangladesh a low-prevalence country. However, existence of vulnerable communities such as sex workers and transgender people, of a large number of migrants and men having sex with men are still matters of concern. Zahid said there exists a lack of technical capacities to predict, understand and combat the HIV epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region. He called upon relevant United Nations agencies and other international organisations to support the national and regional HIV responses. He stressed on promoting health, dignity and human rights of key affected populations and engaging the communities in designing and implementing the programmes. Addressing as chief guest, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said treatment of HIV patients was extremely important because everyone has the right to live with dignity and healthcare. He said the poor, if infected with HIV, become the worst victims. “We want to eradicate poverty by 2024 and do the same in terms of AIDS,” Muhith said. Health Minister Mohammed Nasim said the Asia-Pacific region made significant progress in reducing infections and AIDS-related deaths, but there were still some pockets where the trend was slightly alarming, which requires immediate and focused intervention. UNAIDS Representative Dr Salil Panakandan said, “Fighting AIDS is not a finished job. We need to work together to end the disease by 2030.” Health Secretary Syed Monjurul Islam also spoke.",{},"['health', 'bangladeshs', 'model', 'million', 'international', 'community', 'hiv', 'global', 'reduce', 'aids', 'clinics', 'minister']","Global leaders and activists in the fight against AIDS consider Bangladesh's community clinics as an opportunity and a possible model to reduce HIV infection as part of a global agenda to eliminate the virus by 2030.

TB/HIV co-infection,,,2008-06-09,The Daily Star,"On June 9, for the first time, governments, public health and business leaders, heads of UN agencies and advocates are coming together at United Nations (UN) Headquarters to acknowledge addressing HIV/TB as an urgent priority . This first HIV/TB Global Leaders Forum, convened by Dr. Jorge Sampaio, the UN Secretary-Generals special envoy to stop TB, seeks to galvanise leadership at all levels. The 2008 ""Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World"" report and the 2008 ""Global Tuberculosis Epidemic report of World Health Organization (WHO)"" clearly mandates much heightened urgency in responding to TB-HIV co-infection. Bangladesh continues to have the 5th highest TB burden in the world. TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Approximately one-third of the nearly 40 million PLHIV are also infected with TB. In high TB and HIV burden settings, up to 80% of TB patients may be co-infected with HIV, and half of AIDS-related deaths are caused by TB. Without proper treatment with anti-TB drugs, approximately 90% of people living with HIV die within two to three months of becoming sick with TB, even if they receive anti-retroviral treatment. Worldwide, nearly a quarter of a million people die from HIV/TB co-infection each year. This dual threat is a barrier to keeping people healthy and productive, and impacts poverty reduction plans and the broader development agenda. However, adequate treatment of TB in PLHIV can prolong their life by at least two years. HIV weakens the immune system and makes it more likely that latent TB infection will progress to active TB disease. PLHIV are up to 50 times more likely to develop TB over their lifetime. In many countries insufficient laboratory capacity to test drug-resistance is a serious impediment in scaling up TB programmes. Developing laboratories to provide rapid diagnosis of anti-TB drug-resistance, particularly for PLHIV, is of utmost importance to improve TB responses. Many countries, including Bangladesh, are making impressive gains in treating people living with HIV, but this investment and progress is squandered by a preventable and curable disease -- TB. New strategies and tools are urgently needed to tackle the challenge of TB/HIV co-infection. WHO-recommended collaborative TB/HIV activities must be accelerated, and research stepped up to deliver a new generation of effective anti-TB drugs and diagnostics to keep co-infected people alive. Closer coordination between national TB and HIV programmes and services is vital.",{},"['antitb', 'hivtb', 'report', 'hiv', 'living', 'tbhiv', 'world', 'coinfection', 'plhiv', 'treatment', 'tb']","The 2008 ""Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World"" report and the 2008 ""Global Tuberculosis Epidemic report of World Health Organization (WHO)"" clearly mandates much heightened urgency in responding to TB-HIV co-infection.

Promise to fight,,,2009-01-03,The Daily Star,"Second SAARC conference on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases was organized by SAARC Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Centre (STAC) on 15-18th December, 2008 in Kathmandu. STAC started functioning in Kathmandu, Nepal since 1992 as one of the regional centres for SAARC with the objective to work for prevention and control of tuberculosis and HIV related tuberculosis in the region by coordinating the efforts of the National Tuberculosis Control Programmes of the member countries. Later on STAC has been mandated to work for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in the region (during birth it was named SAARC Tuberculosis Centre. HIV/AIDS was added in the name in 2006). While carrying out activities, STAC realised that it is also necessary to exchange knowledge based on research activities to have clear picture of the region and insight of newer ways. Keeping these in mind, STAC organised maiden conference in 2004 followed by the second one in 2008. The theme of this conference was HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and respiratory diseases. As HIV destroys ones immune system, infected person becomes prone to opportunistic infections like tuberculosis and other respiratory tract infections. In such situation patients have to fight against multiple pathology. That is why, efforts needed to be made to disseminate knowledge not only on HIV but also infections like tuberculosis that takes the chance of immune suppression caused by HIV. That is exactly what STAC attempted in second SAARC conference on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases. Delegates from SAARC countries presented paper elaborating HIV situation of their countries. In India, an estimated number of PLHA is 2.47 million. An estimated 85,000 and 70,256 people are living with HIV/AIDS in Pakistan and Nepal respectively. Though it is a matter of great relief that the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults is less than 1% in Bangladesh with an estimated number of infected 7500 we must not be complacent about the current data. HIV infection in Bangladesh is still believed to be confined among the vulnerable groups such as sex workers, injecting drug users because of their risk behavior. One presentation informed that 77.2% of male IDUs in Dhaka have reported borrowing or lending used syringes. Once the virus is leaked and spread in general population, we will have to face the HIV epidemic. We, as a nation have to be aware to prevent HIV infection. But what about those people who already are living with the virus? Do we have positive attitude towards them? Now time has come to stop scaring people in the name of HIV/AIDS. We have to understand that people can live with HIV infection. All we need to have a positive approach towards PLHA. Acquiring HIV is unfortunate, not crime. If Mr. Co-chairperson of that specific session, living with the virus can roam around the world (he has to attend a lot of conferences) raising his voice for the rights of PLHA, why not others can live. People with AIDS have to be within comprehensive coverage of ART. It is revealed from the conference that there is about ten times more DOTs center than ART centers in Nepal. ART needs to be made available at low cost to HIV positive people. They need to be given total support against all health hazards they could possibly suffer. If cushioned properly, people living with HIV/AIDS can also live a productive life. The writer is a Research Associate at James P.

Bangladesh and high-level meeting on AIDS,,,2011-06-08,The Daily Star,"From June 8 to 10, world leaders will convene in New York City at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) High Level Meeting on AIDS. The gathering of heads of states and other leaders from government, the scientific community, civil society and the private sector offers a unique opportunity to review progress, share lessons learned and chart the future course of the global AIDS response. The meeting comes at a pivotal moment in the history of the epidemic: Thirty years ago, in June 1981, scientists in the United States identified the first case of an immune system failure that would later be defined as AIDS. Ten years ago, at a landmark UNGA Special Session on AIDS, world leaders declared that AIDS was a ""global emergency"" and called for an ""urgent, coordinated and sustained response"" to the epidemic. Now, three decades into the epidemic, what is the global scorecard for the AIDS response? According to a recent report of the UN Secretary-General, more than six million people were accessing lifesaving antiretroviral treatment in low and middle-income countries at the end of 2010 -- up from just 400,000 in 2003. Over the past decade, the number of people newly infected with HIV declined by nearly 20%. And, for the first time in 2009, more than 50% of HIV-positive women were able to ensure that their babies were born HIV free. However, the report underscores that the gains are fragile. The HIV epidemic continues to outpace the response, with an estimated two new HIV infections for every individual starting treatment. Global AIDS resources have flat-lined, and critical sources of leadership and accountability remain untapped. To accelerate progress in the AIDS response, the secretary-general has called on the global community to adopt six goals for the year 2015 -- targets that will be reviewed and endorsed by participants in the June High Level Meeting on AIDS: * Reduce by 50% the sexual transmission of HIV -- including among key populations, such as young people, men who have sex with men, and in the context of sex work -- and prevent all new HIV infections as a result of injecting drug use; * Provide HIV treatment for 13 million people; * Reduce by 50% tuberculosis deaths in people living with HIV; * Eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child, keep mothers alive, and improve the health of women, children and families. * Ensure equal access to education for children orphaned and made vulnerable by AIDS; and * Reduce by 50% the number of countries with HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay and residence. In recent years, Bangladesh has made significant progress towards these goals. From an early start, even before the first HIV infection was detected in the country, Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in keeping HIV infections low. We started our response with quality targeted interventions for most at risk populations, implemented through a human rights based approach and partnering NGOs and civil society. This has helped us keep HIV infection levels low for more than twenty years since the infection was first detected in the country. We have ensured that people who require antiretroviral treatment get them, and the school textbooks have included HIV and life skills education for all school children. Despite these achievements, there is no room for complacency. Bangladesh has a young population and HIV awareness levels among them are often low and substantial numbers of people including international migrants are vulnerable. Vulnerability increases when women are not in a position to exercise their full rights or when they are subjected to gender-based violence. We are committed to ensuring universal access to services for these young and vulnerable populations. The AIDS response requires a long-term commitment and for this we must ensure predictable and sustainable sources of funding. The government of Bangladesh is committed to ensuring universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services to everyone in Bangladesh. We must promote evidence, informed and rights-based approach that is responsive to changing dynamics of the HIV epidemic in Bangladesh. We would ensure that women and people from marginalised sections of the community are given priority in the national AIDS response that is part of the countrys Sixth Five Year Plan. Our government will move to integrate AIDS services in the community clinic service delivery mechanism in phases to benefit the rural population. Most importantly, we shall try to minimise stigma and discrimination that is rife against people living with HIV and other population groups who are vulnerable to HIV infection.

Experts gather in Bali to discuss fight against AIDS,,,2009-08-09,The Daily Star,"Experts from 65 nations gather in Indonesia yesterday to assess progress in the battle against HIV/AIDS amid concern only a quarter of those in need in Asia and the Pacific are getting treatment. The International Congress on AIDS in the region, which will be opened by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on the resort island of Bali, will look at how to ensure ""universal access"" to antiretroviral treatment, congress chairman Zubairi Djoerban said. He said that only 25 percent of the 1.7 million of people with HIV/AIDS in the Asia-Pacific region who need the treatment are receiving it. ""Were still far away from our target,"" he said. ""Were not talking 100 percent, which is the ideal. If Latin America can treat 62 percent of sufferers there, we should strive towards that."" An estimated five million Asians are living with HIV, especially in southeastern countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines and Indonesia, according to a UN report released last year. The congress, which runs until Thursday, will also serve to demand commitment from governments to tackle the disease that killed 380,000 people across Asia in 2007, Djoerban said. ""We ask for commitment from the countries to achieve the targets they have set and if they say they cant, well discuss new efforts to help them reach their goals,"" he added. ""We can discuss prevention and treatment but with no leadership and commitment from countries and the community, we wont achieve much."" While there are some bright spots in the region, such as Cambodia, where HIV prevalence has declined through condom use, new infections are growing steadily in populous countries such as Bangladesh and China, the UN report said. In Indonesia and South Asia, Djoerban said the biggest threat was the lethal combination of dirty needles and unprotected sex. ""Were concerned about India, Indonesia and Pakistan, where there is overlapping of drug injecting and unprotected sex... this includes sex workers taking drugs and drug users not using condoms,"" he said. ""New infections are offsetting positive results from preventive actions."" In Indonesia, where HIV/AIDS cases have tripled since 2005 to 26,632, according to official figures, prisoners and prostitutes have joined injecting drug users to become among the groups most at risk. A third of 254 prison deaths in the country in May this year were due to HIV/AIDS. Meanwhile, one of the worst HIV epidemics outside of Africa is under way in Indonesias remote eastern province of Papua, where 2.4 out of every 100 people are infected due to an influx of migrants workers and a booming sex industry. However, HIV prevalence in the region is still low compared with Africa. ""In South and Southeast Asia, the HIV prevalence is 0.3 percent.

New anti-HIV drug ‘promising',,,2007-10-27,The Daily Star,"A prototype drug, tested on lab-dish samples of the AIDS virus, has shown great promise in attacking HIV from an unprecedented direction, French researchers reported yesterday. The drug inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at a key point -- when it uses the hijacked machinery of an infected immune cell to reassemble its genetic code. This process, called splicing, joins together sections of viral code to form pre-messenger RNA, which is a precursor for messenger RNA (mRNA). This molecule provides the blueprint for cranking out viral proteins and enzymes which are essential for replication. Once these are created, baby viruses can be reproduced en masse within the cell, eventually breaking out and heading into the bloodstream, where they go on to infect other cells. The scientist found that a test molecule, called IDC16, interferes with a human splicing protein called SF2/ASF that is used to do the pre-messenger RNA cut-and-paste. As a result, the reproduction process was braked at the start. In lab-dish tests, IDC16 blocked replication of different strains of HIV-1, including samples from patients who are resistant to the famous ""cocktail"" -- combination therapy -- of anti-HIV drugs. The paper appears in the US open-access journal Public Library of Science (PLoS) Pathogens. In a press release, Frances National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), which is backing the project, said IDC16 was ""extremely promising."" The ""cocktail,"" first introduced in 1995, has been a lifeline for millions of people by attacking the protein gp120, which is on the surface of the virus, and enzymes that are used in other phases of the replication process. The problem, though, is that HIV mutates, making these proteins a shifting target for drug engineers. The authors, led by Jamal Tazi of the Institute of Molecular Genetics in Montpellier, are confident that IDC16 throws up a way of sidestepping mutation. ""Instead of attacking the components brought along by the virus, we use the machinery that it uses in the cell,"" Tazi told AFP. By aiming at splicing, other viruses could be targeted, Tazi added.",{},"['virus', 'promising', 'called', 'antihiv', 'idc16', 'splicing', 'hiv', 'cell', 'drug', 'rna', 'attacking', 'tazi']","A prototype drug, tested on lab-dish samples of the AIDS virus, has shown great promise in attacking HIV from an unprecedented direction, French researchers reported yesterday.

Adolescents: health risks and solutions,"Around 1.2 billion people, or 1 in 6 of the world’s population, are adolescents aged 10 to 19. Most are healthy, but there is still substantial premature death, illness, and injury among adolescents.",,2018-09-30,The Daily Star,"Around 1.2 billion people, or 1 in 6 of the world’s population, are adolescents aged 10 to 19. Most are healthy, but there is still substantial premature death, illness, and injury among adolescents. Promoting healthy behaviours during adolescence, and taking steps to better protect young people from health risks are critical for the prevention of health problems in adulthood, and for countries’ future health and ability to develop and thrive. The main health issues include: Early pregnancy and childbirth The leading cause of death for 15– 19 year old girls globally is complications from pregnancy and childbirth. Better access to contraceptive information and services can reduce the number of girls becoming pregnant and giving birth at too young an age. Laws that specify a minimum age of marriage can help. HIV More than 2 million adolescents are living with HIV. Although the overall number of HIV-related deaths is down 30% since the peak in 2006 estimates suggest that HIV deaths among adolescents are rising. Better access to HIV testing and counselling, and stronger subsequent links to HIV treatment services for those who test HIV positive, are also needed. Mental health Depression is the third leading cause of illness and disability among adolescents, and suicide is the third leading cause of death in older adolescents (15–19 years). Violence, poverty, humiliation and feeling devalued can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Building life skills in children and adolescents and providing them with psychosocial support in schools and other community settings can help promote good mental health. Violence Violence is a leading cause of death in older adolescent males. Globally, 1 in 10 girls under the age of 20 years report experiencing sexual violence. Promoting nurturing relationships between parents and children early in life, providing training in life skills, and reducing access to alcohol and firearms can help to prevent injuries and deaths due to violence. Alcohol and drugs Harmful drinking among adolescents is a major concern in many countries. It reduces self-control and increases risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex or dangerous driving. Setting a minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol and regulating how alcoholic drinks are targeted at the younger market are among the strategies for reducing harmful drinking. Drug use among 15–19 year olds is also an important global concern. Drug control may focus on reducing drug demand, drug supply, or both, and successful programmes usually include structural, community, and individual-level interventions. Injuries Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death and disability among adolescents. In 2015, over 115,000 adolescents died as a result of road traffic accidents. Young drivers need advice on driving safely, while laws that prohibit driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs need to be strictly enforced. Exercise and nutrition Iron deficiency anaemia is the leading cause of years lost to death and disability in 2015. Iron and folic acid supplements are a solution that also helps to promote health before adolescents become parents. Regular deworming in areas where intestinal helminths such as hookworm are common is recommended to prevent micronutrient (including iron) deficiencies. Developing healthy eating and exercise habits in adolescence are foundations for good health in adulthood. Tobacco use The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuring smoke-free environments are crucial.",{},"['risks', 'health', 'death', 'solutions', 'adolescents', 'reducing', 'cause', 'leading', 'hiv', 'age', 'young', 'tobacco']","Promoting healthy behaviours during adolescence, and taking steps to better protect young people from health risks are critical for the prevention of health problems in adulthood, and for countries’ future health and ability to develop and thrive.

New AIDS drug shields monkeys,,,2015-02-20,The Daily Star,"Scientists said Wednesday a new drug tested on monkeys provided an astonishingly effective shield against an animal version of the AIDS virus, a major gain in the quest for an HIV vaccine. Macaque monkeys given the drug were able to fend off high repeated doses of the simian version of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they reported in the journal Nature. The prototype drug, called eCD4-Ig, comprises two imitations of the receptors, or docking points, where HIV latches on to CD4 cells -- the key defences of the immune cells. The mimics latch on to the virus, tricking it into prematurely launching the docking procedure. The virus can only execute the procedure once, rendering it unable to attach to CD4 cells thereafter. The scientists likened the effect to closing the door to an intruder and tossing away the key. The paper reported on a 40-week experiment which showed that inoculated animals thrived even after being injected with four times the dose needed to infect macaques in a ""control"" group.",{},"['shields', 'virus', 'cells', 'docking', 'version', 'hiv', 'procedure', 'drug', 'scientists', 'monkeys', 'reported', 'aids']","Scientists said Wednesday a new drug tested on monkeys provided an astonishingly effective shield against an animal version of the AIDS virus, a major gain in the quest for an HIV vaccine.

He also advocated purity for the nations youth and strengthening religious practice. ""I believe prevention of AIDS would be easy if we didnt do things strictly prohibited by Islam,"" he said. Chowdhury also raised religion during his keynote speech, referring to the doomed cities of Sodom and Gommorah. Chowdhury later dismissed a suggestion his focus on lewdness neglected other methods of transmission, like tainted blood transfusions or shared needles. ""Abstinence is not psychological,"" he said. ""But any sort of uncontrolled activities with regard to sex will lead to this type of infection. We must have control."" Chowdhury also used slides to introduce the audience to the beautiful but deadly HIV virus and showed statistics charting the epidemics course across the world. He said Bangladesh should take advantage of the window of opportunity to counter poverty, illiteracy, ignorance and superstition which helped the HIV virus take hold.

Towards 'zero discrimination',,,2013-12-03,The Daily Star,"While welcoming the solid progress being made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, United Nations officials marked World AIDS Day with urgent appeals for the international community to work even harder to end stigma, discrimination and complacency, to stop new HIV infections among children and to ensure access to care and treatment for all those that need it. “On this World AIDS Day, I am more optimistic than ever. Much of the world is accelerating progress in responding to HIV,” said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, with major drops in new infections and deaths and progress in realising the target of ensuring 15 million people have access to antiretroviral treatment by 2015. “This is crucial to halting and reversing the AIDS epidemic for good,” he added. But, the UN chief continued, as revealed in the UNAIDS 2013 World AIDS Day Report, there are still worrying signals that some regions and countries are falling behind. While advances are being made in reaching vulnerable populations through efforts to eliminate stigma and discrimination, there is still much to do to end this problem. “To create conditions for an AIDS-free generation, we must also step up efforts to stop new HIV infections among children and ensure access to treatment for all mothers living with HIV,” said the Secretary-General, particularly urging action to end the discrimination and violence against women which cause terrible harm and increase risk of HIV infection and death from AIDS. Meanwhile, at a World AIDS Day event earlier in Melbourne, Australia Mr. Sidibé and UNAIDS Global Advocate for Zero Discrimination, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, previewed the zero discrimination campaign, calling for a global transformation.

Service to 1.69 lakh high-risk people uncertain,,,2009-07-08,The Daily Star,"Service to some 1.69 lakh high-risk people for HIV/AIDS becomes uncertain as the World Bank (WB) warned the government of discontinuing the HIV/AIDS Targeted Interventions (HATI) project due to poor performance of National AIDS and STD Programme (NASP). NASP failed to complete bidding procedure for six targeted interventions even after seven months, which was supposed to start from January 2009. So, the WB on June 16 warned the government of discontinuing the project if the process cannot be completed by June 30. “We dont want service disruption as it will lead a huge number of high-risk group to a vulnerable condition and also would tend to increase the prevalence of AIDS/STD in the country,” said Dinesh Nayar, team leader of HNPSP (Health Nutrition and Population Sector Programme). Under the HATI project, the injecting drug users (IDUs), brothel, street, hotel and residence-based sex workers and their clients and MSMs (males having sex with males) were provided services to control HIV/AIDS by around 200 NGOs. The time frame of service providing was fixed initially for 18 months from January 2009-June 2010 after completion of the 2nd phase of the project in December 2008. But the dilly-dallying of the NASP to select NGOs to provide service to those high-risk groups lead 120,000 population to be deprived of getting services from April 2009 under three packages, including intervention for street-based sex workers, hotel and residence-based sex workers and internal migrant/client of sex workers as the activities are closed since April 2009. The reason is that the NGOs that could not win the bidding process stopped working while the new NGOs, which won the bidding, are yet to go through final agreement and cannot start their activities yet. But the rest three packages, which include interventions of brothel-based sex workers, IDUs and MSMs that continued their activities till June, might be stopped now, raising the toll of vulnerable people to 1,69,000 as fresh bidding is yet to be completed. Without showing any apposite reason, NASP re-tendered for these three packages cancelling prior proposal from interested NGOs and bidders again submitted the proposal to NASP. But if the government fails to choose the NGOs properly within a very short time and if the WB does not continue the project, the future of approximately 169,000 target population will be uncertain, said the activists working with the vulnerable groups, adding that many of the Drop in Centres (DICs) have been closed by this time from where the high-risk groups used to receive services. Talking to The Daily Star, Programme Manager of NASP Abdur Rahman, however, said WB would not create any problem as in a meeting on June 25, the government and the WB reached an understanding that the bidding would be completed within a very short time soon after revising the operational plan. He further said that service is not interrupted anywhere. But the fact is that Care Bangladesh has already stopped its activities under the HATI project. “The 32 DICs which were run by the Care directly to provide services to the IDUs have been closed from June 30,” said Selina Ferdous, team leader of Care Bangladesh, adding that they sent a letter to the government regarding this in 1st week of June and as the government neither responded to the letter nor signed any agreement with them, they stopped providing services. “HIV prevalence would increase if the beneficiaries are deprived of getting services,” said Prof Nazrul Islam of Virology department at BSMMU, adding that very few people were brought under the coverage and if they are dejected in this way, it will be harmful for society. The achievements of last five years would be wiped out if the programme is halted even for few days, according to experts. The NGOs continuing their activities under HATI project also apprehended that taking the chance of weaknesses of HATI, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) is capturing the targeted interventions. For this reason, those who would win the bidding process wont have any place to work for. However, Save the Children USA, which is managing the fund and technical side of GFATM fund, said it has been working with 45 NGOs and as per the government decision, it is working with a small group of IDUs at a specific point at old Dhaka in the city where the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is highest among the IDUs. “We are working here just for an interim period,” said Deputy Director in Programme Implementation and Management Amjad Ali. Considering AIDS a national priority issue, the government established NASP as a separate wing under the health and family welfare ministry. But negligence of the high officials of NASP tends to turn the programme a vulnerable one. In the last six months, two programme managers and two line directors were changed in the NASP leading to stop the programme.",{},"['nasp', 'workers', 'ngos', 'wb', 'project', 'uncertain', '169', 'working', 'bidding', 'programme', 'sex', 'service', 'highrisk', 'lakh']","Service to some 1.69 lakh high-risk people for HIV/AIDS becomes uncertain as the World Bank (WB) warned the government of discontinuing the HIV/AIDS Targeted Interventions (HATI) project due to poor performance of National AIDS and STD Programme (NASP).

Law and Our Rights,,,,,"Law event AIDS 2010: Rights Here, Right Now THE largest global AIDS conference, which takes place in Vienna 18 to 23 July, emphasises the central importance of protecting and promoting human rights as a prerequisite to a successful response to HIV. Under the theme “Rights Here, Right Now”, the biannual conference “AIDS 2010” also stresses that concrete human rights measures are needed to protect those most vulnerable to and affected by HIV such as women and girls, people who use drugs, migrants, prisoners and sex workers. “The lack of respect for human rights, including stigma and discrimination, is fueling the epidemic. It is perhaps the greatest barrier to developing an appropriate global response to HIV,” said High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in a video to be screened at the conference. For example, more than 50 countries worldwide continue to have laws prohibiting the cross-border movement of people living with HIV. Experts say that such laws are discriminatory, contrary to sound public health principles, and are preventing an appropriate global response in the fight against the spread of the virus. The United Nations Human Rights office (OHCHR) is calling for the repeal of national legislation which imposes blanket restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of people based on their HIV status alone. “HIV knows no borders. It is therefore important to ensure that international migrants have the same rights as everyone else. A persons HIV status alone should not be seen as a reason for refusing to employ him or her,” Pillay said. UNAIDS Executive Director Michéle Sidibé supported the message. “And for me its time to call all the countries to remove travel restrictions.” “One of the major challenges with HIV response in the world today is stigma, discrimination and criminalisation. In a nutshell, its… about human rights the basic human rights of people,” he said. The AIDS conference, which attracts 25,000 participants worldwide, also features a Human Rights Networking Zone where individuals and organizations can involve visitors to campaign against HIV-related human-rights violations. The Zone is showing a video produced by OHCHR about the deportation of a migrant worker after he was tested HIV positive. Combating HIV/AIDS is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). OHCHR stresses that pursuing development hand-in-hand with human rights gives countries a better chance of achieving the MDGs by 2015.

Women migrant workers vulnerable to AIDS,,,2009-11-24,The Daily Star,"Bangladeshi migrants working in different Arab countries are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS as 20 percent of them are abused sexually in their workplaces, according to a report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The report titled HIV vulnerabilities faced by women migrants: from Bangladesh to Arab states also revealed that 85 percent of women workers are abused physically. The findings of the study conducted by UNDP and Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Programme (OKUP) on 247 women were presented at a programme at a city hotel yesterday. The study also revealed that only nine percent of women workers received pre-departure training. So, they know little about their workplaces, problems they might face there and where to seek help. They also have little knowledge on HIV/AIDS. Speakers at the programme said that most women workers are unskilled or semi-skilled worker and receive minimal salary. The domestic workers in Bahrain and Dubai are paid just about $100 a month. They stressed the need for pre-departure training, voluntary counselling and testing of HIV/ AIDS. They also called for collaboration among the Bangladesh embassy or consulate office, support organisations, migrant workers associations and medical testing centres in the recipient countries to help women workers. Training for embassy or consulate staff on how to deal with HIV issues of migrant workers is also important, they added. Labour Minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said that around one lakh women are working abroad and that the government is planning to open a women labour wing in the embassies in different countries, especially in Arab countries. ""Women officers would be recruited in embassies soon to deal with the issues like HIV/AIDS and others,"" he said. ""The economic gains generated by migrant workers are enormous, making up almost 9.4 percent of GDP in Bangladesh in 2007,"" said Stefan Priesner, UNDP Country Director. ""It is, therefore, critical that good working conditions and support are provided to migrant workers throughout the migration cycle,"" he added.

Improving global health outcomes demands a unified effort,,,2008-12-06,The Daily Star,"Recently published arguments that increased funding for HIV is to blame for the chronic underfunding of broader health systems are rooted in a simplistic analysis of how global health priorities are established. Tragically, these arguments risk pitting natural allies against one another, and obscure the very real synergies that exist between the global response to HIV and the push to strengthen health systems in poor countries. Those living with and vulnerable to life-threatening diseases in these countries stand to gain far more by unified efforts to expand overall funding for global health than they do by efforts to reapportion the inadequate resources now devoted to such issues. In the context of today’s global financial crisis, it is extremely short-sighted for health advocates to suggest that the urgent and very real non-HIV health care needs of the world’s poor could be solved simply by reallocating AIDS funding to other health issues. Such an approach let’s our political leaders off the hook, and in the midst of the political process used to allocate funding, all too often results in less, not more, funding overall. The hard-won progress against HIV/AIDS has come as the result of the tireless, frontline efforts of researchers, health care workers, advocates, volunteers, and people living with HIV (PLHIV) over nearly three decades. While we are seeing the fruit of those efforts in many places, the greatest challenges and the most significant costs are still ahead. An estimated 70% of PLHIV in need of treatment still do not have access to it. Many people at risk for infection have no access to proven prevention programmes, and stigma and discrimination still stymie both treatment and prevention initiatives. The success of the global response to HIV, including treatment and prevention scale up, is not in competition with the goal of strengthening health systems, but rather depends on it. No one understands this better than frontline AIDS professionals who regularly struggle to do their jobs, often with insufficient physical and human resources. Blaming the AIDS response for a shortcoming that was many decades in the making is unwarranted. It also fails to recognise how the roll out of HIV treatment has in many cases eased the pressure on such systems by reducing demand for hospital beds, thereby allowing them to be used for non-HIV patients, and by putting health care workers living with HIV back to work. The creation of new diagnostic laboratories, clinics and medical training facilities has and will continue to have broader, positive effects on public health in underserved communities, as will more aggressive screening and care for pregnant women living with HIV. The push for universal access has also had a major effect on global health advocacy by galvanising patients to demand their right to health care and combating stigma and discrimination against vulnerable populations. For the first time in decades, global health issues are front and centre on the international agendas of such bodies as the United Nations, the G8 and the African Development Forum. Many advocates for primary care, pre- and post-natal care, maternal health and sexual and reproductive health recognise the opportunities presented by this momentum and are finding ways, at the country and international levels, to join forces with those working on HIV to develop an even stronger movement for global health. As the AIDS movement gains traction and recent investments begin to demonstrate tangible progress, it is unfortunate that criticisms from those outside the field are appearing. Demands for a bigger slice of the global health funding pie, which was never big enough in the first place, is short-sighted, at best. The global response to AIDS provides an opening and a mandate to address the chronic under-financing of health systems in developing countries. We must act as a unified global community to seize this opportunity –– it is an opportunity we cannot afford to squander.

Watchdogs sound alarm over TB/HIV deaths,,,2010-07-23,The Daily Star,"Two global health agencies joined forces here yesterday in a campaign aimed at averting 200,000 deaths each year by co-infection from TB and the AIDS virus. ""Every three minutes a person living with HIV has his or her life cut off prematurely by TB,"" said Jorge Sampaio, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moons special envoy on stopping tuberculosis. ""This is completely unacceptable. TB is a preventable and curable disease."" Sampaio presided over a signing of a memorandum of understanding on the sidelines of the 18th International AIDS Conference, gathering the UN agency UNAIDS and Stop TB, a public-private health partnership. They pledged to work towards halving the mortality from TB/HIV in 2015 compared to a base line of 2004, a year in which 400,000 people died. ""We are talking about a massive human tragedy,"" the executive secretary of Stop TB, Marcos Espinal, told AFP. ""African countries in particular have been devastated by co-infection."" Espinal estimated that several billion dollars each year would be needed to reach the 2015 objective, but said much of this could come from smarter use of existing resources. ""There is a package of activities that if properly implemented by countries will work,"" he said. Several dozen activists demonstrated before the event, pounding drums and holding up a black coffin symbolising the death toll from co-infection by the two microbes. In the middle of the past decade, researchers uncovered the dismaying consequence from these two overlapping pandemics: people who were co-infected were often placed on the fast track to deaths. TB is a lung disease that is caused by a germ, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Around two billion people around the world are infected by the bacteria, but the vast majority never fall sick. A far smaller number -- nine million a year -- develop symptoms of the disease. However, the risk doubles when an individual is infected by HIV, which weakens the immune system, allowing the germ to run riot.",{},"['watchdogs', 'alarm', 'health', 'deaths', 'infected', 'work', 'hiv', 'germ', 'countries', 'tbhiv', 'secretary', 'coinfection', 'sound', 'stop', 'tb']","Two global health agencies joined forces here yesterday in a campaign aimed at averting 200,000 deaths each year by co-infection from TB and the AIDS virus.

Many lights for human rights,,,2010-05-22,The Daily Star,"The International AIDS Candlelight Memorial, a programme of the Global Health Council, based in the USA, is one of the oldest and largest grassroots mobilisation campaigns for HIV/AIDS awareness in the world. Started in 1983, the Candlelight Memorial takes place every third Sunday in May and is led by a coalition of some 1,200 community organisations in 115 countries hosting local memorials that honour the lost and raise social consciousness about the disease. The Candlelight is also much more than just a memorial. It provides opportunities for leadership development, policy advocacy, partnerships, and improvement of community mobilisation skills. With 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS today, the Candlelight continues to serve as an important intervention for global solidarity, breaking down barriers, and giving hope to new generations. The Theme of this year’s memorial is ""Many Lights for Human Rights"". The communities all over the world would gather together in solidarity to light the candle to honour the memory of those lost by AIDS, show support for those living with HIV/AIDS, raise awareness of the disease, and mobilise individuals for a common goal of responding to the local impact of HIV/AIDS. This year, Rotary Club of Dhaka Midtown in partnership with UNFPA Bangladesh has come forward to mark the day and observe the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial. The event was highlighted with sharing of commemoration speech, chorus songs and lighting the candles gathering in a circle by all participants to remember those who have lost their lives by AIDS, to support those living with HIV and affected by its impact and to move communities to action.

Herpes drug may help control AIDS virus,,,2008-09-13,The Daily Star,"Published on 12:00 AM, September 13, 2008 Reuters, Washington A cheap, generic drug long used to treat herpes may also help control the AIDS virus, U.S. researchers reported very recently. They found that acyclovir can work against HIV, but only in tissues that are also infected with herpes. The findings, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, help explain why some studies have shown that people taking acyclovir have lower levels of HIV, yet others show that taking acyclovir does not prevent infection with the AIDS virus. The herpes virus itself changes the drug into a form that can work against HIV, said Dr. Leonid Margolis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, who helped lead the study. ""If you suppress herpes, HIV also goes down,"" Margolis said. Acyclovir was the first drug to be designed and made synthetically, without the use of any compounds from plants or animals, Margolis said. It is also very safe, as it does not become active until it encounters a herpes virus — usually herpes simplex 2, the strain that causes genital herpes. The virus completes a chemical reaction called phosphorylation, turning the acyclovir into an active compound. Researchers had noticed that patients with HIV who also took acyclovir for herpes infections tended to have less virus in their blood, a measure called viral load. The lower the viral load, the healthier an HIV patient is. But several high-profile experiments aimed at preventing HIV infection by treating patients for herpes failed. Margolis thinks he knows why. ""If you test acyclovir against HIV in pure cell lines, it doesnt work,"" he said. And in the prevention studies, doctors were trying to completely suppress herpes. ""If you suppress herpes virus completely, there is nothing to phosphorylate,"" he said. So perhaps lower or more infrequent doses might be more effective, he said. This will have to be tested. And the good news is that a patient does not have to be infected with genital herpes to benefit. Any herpes virus will do, including HHV6 and HHV7, viruses that cause a nearly universal childhood infection sometimes called roseola. Like HIV, herpes takes up permanent residence in the body and cannot be eliminated. But drugs can suppress both to prevent symptoms. Adding acyclovir to the cocktails used to treat HIV may strengthen the mix, Margolis said. HIV infects 33 million people globally. It has killed 25 million and there is no cure and no vaccine.",{},"['virus', 'infection', 'control', 'work', 'lower', 'hiv', 'drug', 'margolis', 'aids', 'help', 'suppress', 'herpes', 'acyclovir']","Published on 12:00 AM, September 13, 2008Reuters, WashingtonA cheap, generic drug long used to treat herpes may also help control the AIDS virus, U.S. researchers reported very recently.

Reducing HIV cases,,,2008-11-29,The Daily Star,"Universal and annual voluntary testing followed by immediate antiretroviral therapy treatment (irrespective of clinical stage or CD4 count) can reduce new HIV cases by 95 percent within 10 years, according to new findings based on a mathematical model developed by a group of HIV specialists in WHO. The findings were published in The Lancet to stimulate discussion, debate and further research. Authors of the study also report that the universal voluntary testing followed by immediate ART could have additional public health benefits, including reducing the incidence of tuberculosis and the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Additionally, the model suggests that there could be a significant reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality in resource-limited countries with generalised HIV epidemics. The current WHO policy on treatment involves voluntary testing and clinical and/or immunological evaluation (e.g. Cd4 count) to determine eligibility for treatment with antiretrovirals. The authors emphasise the theoretical nature of the exercise based on data and raise a number of concerns regarding feasibility, including the protection of individual rights, drug resistance, toxicity and financing challenges. WHO-recommended preventive interventions need to be maintained and expanded. This includes male circumcision, partner reduction, correct and consistent use of condoms, and interventions targeting most-at-risk populations, also known as ""combination prevention.""

"Unsafe use of injections increasing risk of hepatitis, HIV: Study",,,2009-11-15,The Daily Star,"Unsafe use of injections in the hospitals is increasing the risk of infection of Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the country, a study revealed. The study jointly conducted by Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology of Dhaka University and the Centre for Social Research in Medicine and Health, School of Pharmacy of Nottingham University, also revealed that the health professionals are also at risk of infections for unsafe use of injections. UK-Bangladesh Higher Education Link Programme under the British Council funded the study that covered some 24 Upazila Health Complexes in six divisions. The research findings were revealed at a seminar titled Unsafe injection and the risk of HBV, HCV and HIV infection: Ways to reduce the risk at the British Council auditorium yesterday. The study revealed that rate of use of injections is higher in all the hospitals than actual need. On an average injection is being used in 77.92 percent cases. But, safety measures while injecting the patients are quite inappropriate. Using soap or alcohol in hand washing, cleansing the injectable place with rectified spirit, preparing the injection in a clean table and to watch the reaction of the patient after injecting are not followed as part of safety measures, the study showed. ""Though it is good that disposable syringes are being used, but disposal of used materials are not taking place properly that increases the risk of infectious diseases even those who are engaged in waste management,"" said Prof AK Azad Chowdhury, lead investigator of the study and teacher of Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology. The health care providers except some in the Dhaka and Rajshahi division are not properly trained for safe injection and very few of the health professionals have got the HBV and HCV vaccine, he said while presenting the summery of the findings. Pointing to the global situation he also said that half of the worlds 15 billion injections is unsafe. 20 million HBV infections, 2 million HCV infections and 2, 60,000 HIV new infections are associated with unsafe use of injections each year worldwide. When 10 percent people are carrier of HBV and 3.6 percent of HCV in the country, it is important to take immediate intervention, including rational use of injections, maintaining safety measures and training of the health professionals, the experts said.

Law and Our Rights,,,,,"Human Rights Advocacy UN calls for strong action to eliminate violence against women The United Nations marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women with calls for states to take legal action against the global scourge, for societies to change a mindset that permits such abuse, and for women themselves to stand up and speak out against a culture of shame. “Violence against women remains pervasive worldwide,” Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message. “It is the most atrocious manifestation of the systemic discrimination and inequality women continue to face, in law and in their everyday lives, around the world. It occurs in every region, country, and culture, regardless of income, class, race or ethnicity.” Noting that leaders at Septembers UN World Summit pledged to redouble efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and the girls, he stressed that this required a change of the mindset, still all too common and deep-seated, that violence against women is acceptable. “That means leadership in showing, by example, that when it comes to violence against women and girls, there are no grounds for tolerance and no tolerable excuses,” he declared. The UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) said violence against women is both a cause and consequence of rising rates of HIV infection: a cause because rape and sexual assault pose a major risk factor for HIV transmission, and a consequence because HIV-positive status makes women more likely to be targeted for abuse. “Violence against women is the most pervasive violation of human rights, occurring every day, in every country and every region, regardless of income or level of development,” UNIFEM Executive Director Noeleen Heyzer said, citing a UN World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that nearly one in four women will be raped, beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime, sometimes with fatal consequences. She called for three major actions to break “this vicious cycle” of violence: countries must pass and enforce laws to deter acts of violence against women and reduce the spread of HIV; women who have suffered abuse must speak out to break the culture of shame and stigma; and awareness must be raised on the links between violence against women and HIV/AIDS, especially by the media. “Together we must prevent and punish violence against women,” UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid said. “Social norms and attitudes that condone discrimination and violence against women and girls can be changed. This is the first step, which requires awareness raising, behaviour change and social mobilization.” She, too, called for strengthened legal protections as well as the provision of health information and services. Urging stronger efforts to fight violence against women, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour also called for a change of mindset. “We urge States to challenge societal values that support discrimination against women and legitimize violence against them, adopt specific legislation addressing domestic violence and end impunity for crimes committed against women,” she said in a message co-signed by the Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, its causes and consequences, Yakin Ertürk. The first-ever WHO study on domestic violence, released, shows that intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence in womens lives - much more so than assault or rape by strangers or acquaintances. The study reports on the enormous toll physical and sexual violence by husbands and partners has on the health and well-being of women around the world and the extent to which partner violence is still largely hidden. “ This study shows that women are more at risk from violence at home than in the street and this has serious repercussions for womens health,” WHO Director-General Lee Jong-wook said. “The study also shows how important it is to shine a spotlight on domestic violence globally and treat it as a major public health issue.” The Womens Health and Domestic Violence Against Women study, based on interviews with more than 24,000 women from rural and urban areas in 10 countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia and Montenegro, Thailand and Tanzania, calls for action by policy makers and the public health sector, including integrating violence prevention into a range of social programmes. Saying protecting refugee women from violence was one of his top priorities, UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres said in a message to all UNHCR staff: “We know that they are constantly subject to violence, abuse and exploitation in many operations around the world.” “Discussions with women and girls across all regions, be it Colombia, Darfur, Bangladesh, (the former Yugoslav Republic of) Macedonia, or Pakistan, unfortunately confirm that in addition to rape and sexual abuse, girls can be harassed and subject to violence as they go to school, collect firewood, or go to work, as well as through traditional harmful practices and domestic violence.” Source: UN News Centre.",{},"['health', 'women', 'girls', 'change', 'violence', 'domestic', 'world', 'rights', 'law', 'human', 'study']","“Violence against women remains pervasive worldwide,” Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message. “It is the most atrocious manifestation of the systemic discrimination and inequality women continue to face, in law and in their everyday lives, around the world. “Together we must prevent and punish violence against women,” UN Population Fund (UNFPA) Executive Director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid said. “Social norms and attitudes that condone discrimination and violence against women and girls can be changed.

Govt aware of perils of AIDS,,,2003-01-16,The Daily Star,"Prime Minister Khaleda Zia yesterday said her government has taken up several programmes to raise awareness of the people, especially women and youths, about the danger of HIV/AIDS. She informed Dr Nafis Sadik, special envoy of the UN secretary-general for HIV/AIDS in Asia now visiting Dhaka, that her government is fully aware of the perils of the viral disease when the envoy called on her yesterday. Welcoming Dr Sadik, Khaleda Zia informed her that the government is giving importance on creating awareness about the deadly disease through education and media. The prime minister said extensive education programme taken up by the government would have positive impact in the society about the disease. Khaleda Zia said although the rate of HIV/AIDS is still low, it is important to take preventative steps from now. So it is important to identify high-risk groups and focus on commercial sex workers, migrant workers and drug users. The prime minister explained to the special envoy that social makeup of Bangladesh is different from other countries. Teaching of religion is prevalent in every village. This provides a good moral ground in the society. As Dr Nafis referred to her meeting with religious leaders yesterday morning, Khaleda Zia said they can play a vital role in creating awareness of all social problems including HIV/AIDS since they have large and captive audience in the society. The prime minister said the existing mechanism would be strengthened. Appropriate partnership programmes with NGOs will be promoted to achieve maximum results.

Myths and fears,,,2013-08-28,The Daily Star,"source: BDHS, 2011 Universal access to reproductive health (RH) is one of the sub-targets for the Millennium Development Goal number five which is to improve maternal health. One of the major barriers to improve the universal access to reproductive health is myths and fears associated with RH. In rural areas of Bangladesh, there is prevalence of local knowledge about RH that differs significantly from the medical/scientific school of thought. For instance, there is a certain belief regarding menstruation that a woman should not visit specific places or avoid certain foods during that time. These ideas deriving mainly from the elderly members of the population, can present challenges to girls beginning their menstrual cycles. As a result, girls are kept in the dark about proper medical knowledge and are stopped from reaping the benefits of modern medical innovations. A more common fear regarding RH is the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. In Bangladesh the concept of HIV/AIDS usually carries a negative connotation with it and anyone suffering from the disease is looked upon with a sense of skepticism. In addition, misinformation regarding prevention and spread of HIV/AIDS is rampant. These two factors coupled together stop many men and women from accessing medical support as they are afraid to get tested or admit positive results for fear of stigmatization. Due to this, statistical data on those living with HIV/AIDS is not accurate and is likely to be an underestimation. Another socially-created anxiety is that surrounding the exposure to sex education in Bangladesh. There is a popular belief that sex education and exposure to sex-education materials will lead to more adolescent sexual activity. This puts many to risk as they are kept in the dark regarding many STDs and their preventions leading to greater health hazards. Moreover, many people can shy away from seeking medical support upon contraction of STDs due to the stigma attached to that. Another problem is that many men and women withdraw from consulting with nurses or doctors of the opposite sex. For instance, a male patient often finds it uncomfortable to openly discuss his problems relating to RH with female doctors or nurses. Conversely, a female patient feels reserved to talk about her problems with health providers of the opposite sex. This inhibition serves as a barrier for many from attaining RH support. In order for RH programs and policies to be effective, it is important that these policies take into account the role of religious attitudes in Bangladesh. A considerable degree of RH organizations received favorable cooperation from community religious leaders. However, when it came to topics of intimacy between unmarried people, these leaders refused to cooperate. This leaves a certain section of people outside the circle of RH services. An interesting point to note is that Sylhet and Chittagong need the highest priority when it comes to reproductive health services. Modern contraceptive prevalence rate is the lowest and the rate of unmet need for family planning is the highest in these two divisions. It should be pointed out that Sylhet and Chittagong also have the lowest secondary school enrolment rates, implying they are lagging behind in education compared to other divisions. Lack of education can be one of the reasons why awareness about RH is low in those divisions. Access to proper RH is crucial as it not only ensures good health to the parents but also to the children. Attention must be given in order to eradicate the barriers in order to improve access to RH in Bangladesh otherwise Millennium Development Goal number five Improving maternal mortality would not be attained.

Set up first AIDS hospital in Ctg,,,2010-09-04,The Daily Star,"Experts have suggested transforming Central Skin and Social Hygiene Centre (CSSHC) into the countrys first AIDS hospital, as people in Chittagong are more vulnerable to this sexually transmitted disease. ""The first case of HIV/AIDS in the country was detected in Chittagong…geographic location and historic realities have exposed the people of the port city to all venereal diseases including AIDS,"" Professor Dr M A Foyez, former director general of Health Services, told BSS. He added that besides being countrys main seaport, Chittagong was also bordered by some regions of neighbouring India and Myanmar where the HIV infections are highly prevalent. ""So the risk of spreading of the disease in the district is comparatively higher than that in other parts of the country,"" he said. His comments came as officials said a proposal was sent to the health ministry suggesting that CSSHC be turned into a specialised hospital for HIV/AIDS treatment, because it has been already treating patients with HIV since its first detection in 2000. ""We have proposed the CSSHC to be turned into a hospital with 20 beds,"" ruling Awami League lawmaker MA Latif supplemented the officials. Community health experts and medical practitioners said the then government decided to set up the CSSHC at Agrabad area 60 years ago, as the city was exposed to the dangers of spread of venereal diseases carried by local and foreign mariners. Once known as American Hospital, the centre was set up under the joint supervision of the US Government and World Health Organization (WHO) as per the International Brussels Act, 1952. The act had facilitated the simultaneous installation of four such identical facility centers in Southeast Asia. So long, the CSSHC, remains as the only specialised hospital for dermatological and venereal diseases in Chittagong region. At the inception of the CSSHC, only the mariners from home and abroad used to take the treatment of leprosy, dermatological, and venereal diseases under the supervision of American physicians. Later, it was made open to all. At present, around 400 outer patients are being treated at the CSSHC and the students of FCPS second part attend one-year training course in this institution. At present, various dermatological diseases including scabies, impetigo, eczema, tenia, psoriasis, articaria, acne, vitiligo, syphilis, gonorrhoea, and cancroids are treated here. Dr Sheikh Shafiul Azam, Chittagong unit president of Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA), told BSS that they had sent a proposal to the ministry to upgrade CSSHC to  Institute of Dermatology and Venereal Diseases (IDVD).

Call for improved understanding of optimal treatment strategies and greater involvement,,,2008-08-09,The Daily Star,"Speakers at the XVII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2008) underscored the importance of simultaneously scaling up AIDS programmes and strengthening health systems in poor countries, emphasising that the two goals should be viewed as allies, not adversaries — says a press release by the International AIDS Society (IAS). Experts warned that the global shortage of health care workers hampers both goals and demands a collective response. They also stressed the importance of expanding the role of people living with HIV in the planning and provision of health care as a part of the solution. “HIV and global health advocates have enough common enemies, chief among them political complacency and inadequate human and financial resources,” said Dr. Luís Soto Ramírez, Local Co-Chair of AIDS 2008 and Head of the Molecular Virology Unit at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán and Coordinator of the Clinical Care Committee of CONASIDA, Mexico’s National AIDS Council. “In the struggle to recognise health care as a human right, we are natural partners.” “If the urgency of AIDS and the sheer magnitude of human loss we are now experiencing is not enough to compel us to provide even the most basic level of health care to those living in low-income countries, then we, as a global community, are morally bankrupt,” said Dr. Pedro Cahn, International Co-Chair of AIDS 2008 and President of the International AIDS Society and Fundación Huésped in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “If, in the context of AIDS, we walk away from this challenge, we may never get another chance.” More evidence to weigh in determining when and how to start treatment According to Anton Pozniak (United Kingdom) of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, the questions of “when to start?” and “what to start with?"" remain central to people living with HIV and their clinicians as they consider antiretroviral therapy. The move to start treatment earlier is gaining momentum in light of evidence that those untreated patients with CD4 counts above 350 have significantly higher rates of non-AIDS related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease. Pozniak stated that clinical trials are needed to weigh the benefits of starting earlier with the downsides of earlier therapy, including toxicity, resistance and maintaining long-term adherence. Debates regarding which therapies to use in initiating treatment also continue in those countries where there is an abundance of choice. The first randomised clinical trial to compare the use of boosted protease inhibitors (PI) with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), both as the anchor of initial treatment regimens, found virological or immunological benefits to both approaches. Pozniak reviewed data on monotherapy with boosted PIs, which may save money and spare users the long-term toxicity of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). He also noted some unexpected toxicities associated with regimens using NRTIs as the backbone of treatment. Some nucleosides are used extensively in resource-poor countries despite these toxicities, because of lower costs. Pozniak also presented evidence of the effectiveness of tailored combinations for treatment-experienced patients. He concluded that in situations where there is a choice of therapies, treatment of HIV has become focused on minimising toxicities and maximising convenience, and that this choice should be offered to all people living with HIV. Strengthening health systems through greater involvement of PLHIV According to Morolake Odetoyinbo (Nigeria), CEO of Positive Action for Treatment Access, the greater involvement of people living with HIV (PLHIV) can be a key component of efforts to strengthen fragile health systems in low- and middle-income countries. These already fragile systems have been further taxed by the HIV epidemic, which has depleted the health workforce due to illness and death, and magnified the impact of existing malnutrition. Odetoyinbo also warned that lack of treatment literacy and unstable drug supplies are leading to HIV drug resistance and multi-drug resistant TB. Highlighting the existing involvement of PLHIV as counselors, peer educators, and spokespersons, Odetoyinbo explained how PLHIV can do even more to help strengthen health systems if their involvement is rooted in their existing capacities and skills, and not used to simply fill quotas. According to Odetoyinbo, there also must be an environment that allows professionals living with HIV to be actively involved in health systems. PLHIV should have multi-dimensional roles as advocates, watchdogs and managers, and should also be active participants in decision-making bodies responsible for the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of programmes.",{},"['care', 'systems', 'involvement', 'understanding', 'health', 'pozniak', 'start', 'hiv', 'strategies', 'living', 'countries', 'optimal', 'aids', 'improved', 'treatment', 'greater']","Experts warned that the global shortage of health care workers hampers both goals and demands a collective response.

Bangladesh among five nations with rising AIDS,,,2007-08-21,The Daily Star,"Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/AIDS infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, despite prevalence rates remaining low in the region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Colombo yesterday. Over 2,000 officials, experts, healthcare workers and victims have gathered in Colombo for the conference to share their experience in fighting the spread of the disease and treating those who are already infected in the region, which has the second largest number of people affected by HIV in the world, with around 300,000 AIDS-related deaths a year. They will hold around 250 seminars, workshops, sessions and symposiums over five days between August 19 and 23 under the theme of ""Waves of Change, Waves of Hope."" UNAIDS officials yesterday said there are plenty of reasons to worry about AIDS in the region, ""Starkly underlined by the rising number of new infections in countries like China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan."" However, other experts and practitioners said Bangladesh still has relatively low prevalence rates, with concentrated cases in Dhaka and three other cities, defying fears that an injected drugs users epidemic would have accelerated the spread of the infection to disastrous levels within 2008. The UNAIDS also observed that political instability directly affects the battle against HIV as programmes face a shortage of funds and treatment services and it becomes harder for people to access health services. Bangladesh has over 50 participants at the conference, a number of them taking part in sessions where they shared their experiences and observations, alongside participants from the region who identified social stigma and ignorance as some of the biggest challenges to preventing AIDS. ""The Asia and Pacific region has a low prevalence of HIV/AIDS, but the challenge across the countries is to keep the prevalence low,"" Deborah Landey, deputy director of UNAIDS, said at a news briefing before the conference. She also revealed that the prevalence of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has come down from 8.3 million to 5.4 million in the region. That number, although considerable, remains far below the number in sub-Saharan Africa, where 25.8 million people are infected. Landey said each country must keep on its toes for new social trends in the spread of the virus, citing the example of rising infections among homosexuals in China. Strong political leadership that does not become complacent over relatively low levels of infection is vital for keeping the disease at bay, she said. Populations traditionally thought to be low-risk, including married women, are becoming more vulnerable, she said. Married women are exposed to becoming infected by their husbands and experts cited to reports from numerous countries, suggesting that more than half of the newly infected people were married women, she said. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa opened the conference on Sunday. The congress will hold discussions on a range of subjects, including preventing infections among vulnerable groups, treatment of those already infected and eliminating social stigma for victims and their families, the organisers said.",{},"['spread', 'nations', 'region', 'women', 'social', 'rising', 'infected', 'low', 'aids', 'prevalence', 'countries', 'infections', 'number', 'bangladesh']","Bangladesh has been identified as one of the five countries where HIV/AIDS infections are rising in the Asia-Pacific region, despite prevalence rates remaining low in the region, it was revealed at the 8th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific in Colombo yesterday.

Cabinet okays draft law on prevention,The cabinet yesterday approved a proposed law aiming at preventing and controlling communicable diseases in the country.,,2016-05-10,The Daily Star,"The cabinet yesterday approved a proposed law aiming at preventing and controlling communicable diseases in the country. The proposed law titled Communicable Disease Prevention, Control and Elimination Act, 2016 has a provision of jail term and fine for a person who is affected with such a disease but does not undergo medical tests for detection. Briefing reporters after a cabinet meeting at the Secretariat, Cabinet Secretary M Shafiul Alam said the affected persons concerned would also have to be examined in related and specified institutes to detect the types of their diseases. If a patient avoids medical tests to detect presence of diseases considered as transmittable, they would face one-year imprisonment or Tk 2 lakh fine, he added. Alam said one of the goals of the draft law is to protect people from communicable diseases as well as taking proper measures to create mass awareness about germs related diseases like Kala-Azar, HIV, Influenza, Nipah, Ebola and Typhoid. Under the proposed law, a patient or the affected persons would have to be screened and isolated to protect common people from being affected, he observed. Experts have termed the proposed law a “landmark and a milestone.” “Its a landmark decision of the government. With enactment of the law, Bangladeshs health sector will move one step forward,” said Prof Dr AKM Shamsuzzaman, director of Communicable Disease Control of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). He told The Daily Star that communicable diseases would be eliminated more quickly with the implementation of the law. Communicable diseases like malaria, dengue, Filariasis, Kala-azar, all types of influenza, Nipah, HIV, viral hepatitis, among others, would be brought under the legal framework of the law, he added. Prof Shamsuzzaman further said, “We used to face difficulties in dealing with diseases which appear suddenly on any part of the country. With the enactment of the law, the health department will be able to involve other government bodies concerned including the law-enforcement agencies for controlling such outbreaks.” Emerging threats of diseases like Zika and communicable diseases which transmit frequently on bordering areas would be dealt under legal framework, he said, thanking the government for approving the proposed law. The health ministry moved to enact the law in 2014 but couldnt do so due to various bureaucratic tangles, according to insiders. The draft law was prepared in line with and replacing the Bangladesh Malaria Eradication (Repeal) Ordinance, 1977 and the Prevention of Malaria (Special Provisions) Ordinance, they said. As per the proposed law, the authorities concerned will create quarantine facilities for affected persons. The law also creates a scope for the government to take all kinds of assistance from other countries to prevent communicable diseases. 16 UNIONS TO BE ADDED After the cabinet meeting, the National Implementation Committee for Administrative Reforms (NICAR) with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair approved the LGRD ministrys proposal to add 16 unions to two Dhaka city corporations, doubling the areas of the capital. With the inclusion of eight unions each to Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) and Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), the size of the metropolis would be 270 square kilometres from the existing 129 square kilometres, said the cabinet secretary. He added the decision had been taken in order to provide better civic amenities to the people of these unions. Beraid, Badda, Bhatara, Satarkul, Horirampur, Uttarkhan, Dakkhinkhan and Dumni would be included in DNCC, while Shyampur, Matuail, Demra, Dania, Sarulia, Dakkhingaon, Nasirabad and Manda would be included in DSCC. Alam said the NICAR also approved a proposal to upgrade Karnaphuli Police Station of Patia in Chittagong to a new upazila. It will be the 490th upazila of the country and will be formed with five unions excluded from 22 unions of Patia upazila, he said. Replying to a query at his ministry office, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said they would face no financial burden with the doubling size of the city corporation areas. He added financial position of the two city corporations is quite well off.",{},"['okays', 'draft', 'diseases', 'health', 'proposed', 'cabinet', 'communicable', 'persons', 'city', 'law', 'unions', 'affected', 'prevention']","The cabinet yesterday approved a proposed law aiming at preventing and controlling communicable diseases in the country.

No room for complacency,,,2009-11-30,The Daily Star,"ACCORDING to new data in Epidemic Update published by UNAIDS and WHO very recently, HIV infections have decreased by 17% over the past eight years. In East Asia, HIV infections declined by nearly 25% and in South and South East Asia by 10% in the same time period. The number of AIDS-related deaths has declined by over 10% over the past five years as more people gained to access to life saving treatment. UNAIDS and WHO estimate that since the availability of effective treatment in 1996, some 2.9 million lives have been saved. The latest epidemiological data indicate that globally the spread of HIV appears to have peaked in 1996, when 3.5 million [3.2 million3.8 million] new HIV infections occurred. In 2008, the estimated number of new HIV infections was approximately 30% lower than at the epidemics peak 12 years earlier. Consistent with the long interval between HIV Sero-conversion and symptomatic disease, annual HIV-related mortality appears to have peaked in 2004, when 2.2 million [1.9 million2.6 million] deaths occurred. The estimated number of AIDS related deaths in 2008 is roughly 10% lower than in 2004. However, in some countries there are signs that new HIV infections are rising again. HIV prevalence is still increasing in some parts of our region, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan. Bangladesh has transitioned from a low-level epidemic to a concentrated epidemic, with especially elevated rates among injecting drug users (Azim et al., 2008). The overwhelming majority of people with HIV, some 95% of the global total, live in the developing world. The proportion is set to grow even further as infection rates continue to rise in countries where poverty, poor health care systems and limited resources for prevention and care fuel the spread of the virus. There is increased evidence of risk among key populations. While high HIV prevalence has long been documented among sex workers in diverse countries worldwide, evidence was extremely limited regarding the contribution of men who have sex with men and injecting drug users to epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. What is HIV/AIDS HIV stands for: Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV is a virus that cannot grow or reproduce on its own, it need to infect the cells of a living organism in order to replicate. The human immune system usually finds and kills viruses, but HIV attacks the immune system itself. As HIV progressively damages these cells, the body becomes more vulnerable to infections, which it will have difficulty in fighting off. AIDS stands for: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is a medical condition. A person is diagnosed with AIDS when his/her immune system is too weak to fight off infections. It takes around ten years on average for someone with HIV to develop AIDS. However, this average is based on the person with HIV having a reasonable diet, and someone who is malnourished may well progress from HIV to AIDS more rapidly. Since AIDS was first identified in the early 1980s, an estimated 33.4 people have been attacked by HIV/AIDS. A person first develops an AIDS-related condition or symptom, called an ""opportunistic infection."" AIDS can be diagnosed when the number of immune system cells (CD4 cells) in the blood of an HIV positive person drops below a certain level. It is important to remember that a person who has HIV can pass on the virus immediately after becoming infected, even if he/she feels healthy. The only way to know for certain if someone is infected with HIV is for them to be tested. How is HIV passed on HIV is found in the blood and the sexual fluids of an infected person, and in the breast milk of an infected woman. There are various ways a person can become infected with HIV: -Unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected person; -Contact with an infected persons blood; -Use of infected blood products: Many people in the past have been infected with HIV by the use of blood transfusions and blood products which were contaminated with the virus; -Injecting drugs: HIV can be passed on when injecting equipment that has been used by an infected person is then used by someone else. -From mother to child: HIV can be transmitted from an infected woman to her baby during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Certain groups of people, such as injecting drug users, sex workers, prisoners, and men who have sex with men have been particularly affected by HIV. However, HIV can infect anybody, and everyone needs to know how they can and cant become infected with HIV. Minimising measures Minimising the impact of HIV will require massive response at the national and international levels: -People need to challenge the myths and misconceptions about human sexuality that translate into dangerous sexual practices; -Legislation is needed to reduce prejudice felt by HIV+ people around the world and the discrimination that prevents people from ""coming out"" as being HIV positive; -HIV prevention initiatives need to be increased, people across the world need to be made aware of the dangers, the risks, and the ways they can protect themselves; -Condom promotion and supply need to be increased; -Appropriate sexual health education must be provided to young people before they reach an age where they become sexually active; -Medication and support need to be provided to people who are already HIV+, so that they can live longer and more productive lives. -Support and care must be provided for those children who have been orphaned by AIDS. AIDS out of Isolation One of the significant findings of the report is that the impact of the AIDS response is high where HIV prevention and treatment programs have been integrated with other health and social welfare services. Asias epidemic has long been concentrated in specific populations, namely injecting drug users, sex workers and their clients, and men who have sex with men. However, the epidemic in many parts of Asia is steadily expanding into lower-risk populations through transmission to the sexual partners of those most at risk. In China, where the epidemic was previously driven by transmission during injecting drug use, heterosexual transmission has become the predominant mode of HIV transmission (Wang et al., 2009). Several countries have taken steps to scale up medical male circumcision for HIV prevention, including Botswana, Kenya and Namibia (Forum for Collaborative HIV Research, 2009). Botswana is integrating male circumcision into its national surgery framework, with the aim of reaching 80% of males aged 049 by 2013 (Forum for Collaborative Research, 2009). As of March 2009, Swaziland had drafted a formal male circumcision policy (Mngadi et al., 2009). A recent analysis determined that the scale-up of adult male circumcision in 14 African countries would require considerable funding (an estimated $ 919 million over five years) and substantial investments in human resources development, but that scale-up would save costs in the long run by altering the trajectory of national epidemics (Auvert et al., 2008). Policy measures To be successful, a comprehensive HIV prevention program needs strong political leadership. This means politicians and leaders in all sectors must speak out openly about AIDS and not shy away from difficult issues like sex, sexuality and drug use. An effective response requires strategic planning based on good quality science and surveillance, as well as consideration of local society and culture. All sectors of the population should be actively involved in the response, including employers, religious groups, non-governmental organisations and HIV-positive people. Many of the worlds most successful HIV prevention efforts have been led by the affected communities themselves. HIV epidemics thrive on stigma and discrimination related to people living with the virus and to marginalised groups such as sex workers. Their spread is also fueled by gender inequality, which restricts what women can do to protect themselves from infection. Protecting and promoting human rights should be an essential part of any comprehensive HIV prevention strategy. This includes legislating against the many forms of stigma and discrimination that increase vulnerability. Concluding message ""International and national investment in HIV treatment scale-up have yielded concrete and measurable results,” said Dr Margaret Chan, Director General of WHO. “We cannot let this momentum wane. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, and save many more lives."" Nicholas Biswas is a Researcher and Development Activist.

Small breakthroughs offer big hope,,,2012-07-29,The Daily Star,"Small but significant breakthrough studies on people who have been able to overcome or control HIV were presented Thursday at a major world conference on ways to stem the three-decade-old disease. One study focused on a group of 12 patients in France who began treatment on antiretroviral drugs within 10 weeks of becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus, but then stopped the therapy after nearly three years. The virus has stayed away for a median of six years in the group, known as the Visconti Cohort, which stands for ""Virological and Immunological Studies in CONtrollers after Treatment Interruption."" This unique group of people did not completely eliminate HIV, but continued to possess it at an extremely low level in their cells and did not become sick. ""These results suggest that the antiretroviral treatment should be started very early after infection,"" said Charline Bacchus, lead researcher of the study at Frances national AIDS research agency ANRS. Scientists are continuing to study the immune characteristics of this group for clues as to why they do not need prolonged medication. For most HIV patients, antiretroviral drugs must be taken for life. There are currently 34 million people living with HIV worldwide. In low- and middle-income nations, which are the most affected by the pandemic, about eight million people are now taking antiretrovirals for treatment, about half those in need. A study involved two HIV-positive men whose DNA showed no trace of the virus eight and 17 months respectively after receiving stem cell transplants from an outside donor as treatment for blood cancer. Their cases are different from the well-known ""Berlin patient,"" American Timothy Brown, who is considered cured of HIV and leukemia five years after receiving similar bone marrow transplants from a rare donor naturally resistant to HIV, or lacking a CCR5 receptor. The men have been followed for two and three and a half years respectively, with no sign of the viruss return. Researchers believe that by continuing to treat the men with antiretroviral drugs during the process, the medicine prevented the donor cells from becoming infected until they were able to provide the men with new immune defenses. The study was presented at the 19th International AIDS Conference. Reacting to the news, Brown expressed ""joy"" at the potential for two more men to be free of HIV. ""As I have said many times before, I want everyone to be cured of this disease. We can only hope that this case and todays development represents the beginning of the end of this plague,"" he said in a statement.",{},"['virus', 'group', 'big', 'antiretroviral', 'hope', 'donor', 'offer', 'men', 'study', 'transplants', 'hiv', 'small', 'breakthroughs', 'drugs', 'treatment']","""These results suggest that the antiretroviral treatment should be started very early after infection,"" said Charline Bacchus, lead researcher of the study at France's national AIDS research agency ANRS.

HIV transmission reduced by 96%,,,2011-05-14,The Daily Star,"An HIV-positive person who takes anti-retroviral drugs after diagnosis, rather than when their health declines, can cut the risk of spreading the virus to uninfected partners by 96 percent, according to a recent study from the US National Institutes of Health, says BBC. “This breakthrough is a serious game changer and will drive the prevention revolution forward. It makes HIV treatment a new priority prevention option,"" said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS).

"Situation improves, not much in Bangladesh","A total of 1.5 million people died from TB in 2014, says the WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 released yesterday.",,2015-10-30,The Daily Star,"A total of 1.5 million people died from TB in 2014, says the WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 released yesterday. It was a significant progress compared to that of 2000 when the figure was almost double, said the report released in Washington. “In all, effective diagnosis and treatment saved 43 million lives between 2000 and 2015,” it said. Of the deaths from TB last year, 8,90,000 were men; 4,80,000 women; and 1,40,000 children. The disease ranks alongside HIV as a leading killer worldwide. Of the 1.5 million people killed by TB last year, 4,00,000 were HIV-positive. HIVs total death toll in 2014 was estimated at 1.2 million. The TB situation, however, has not improved in Bangladesh where 81,000 died from TB last year, the figure was 80,000 the previous year. People diagnosed with TB in Bangladesh stands at 6,40,000, which was 6,30,000 the year before. TB patients with HIV/AIDS in the country are very low, just 1,110. “The report shows that TB control has had a tremendous impact in terms of lives saved and patients cured,” said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan in a statement. “These advances are heartening, but if the world is to end this epidemic, it needs to scale up services and, critically, invest in research.” Worldwide, TB infections have dropped 18 percent since 2000, which is 1.5 percent every year. Bangladesh aimed at reducing the death rate associated with TB to 30 per 1,00,000, but it is now 51. Mario Raviglione, director of WHOs Global TB Programme, said the world was still facing a burden of 4,400 people dying every day. This years report describes higher global totals for new TB cases (9.6 millions) than in previous years. However, these figures reflect increased and improved national data and in-depth studies rather than any increase in the spread of the disease. More than half of the worlds TB cases (54 percent) were in China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan. Among new cases, an estimated 3.3 percent have multidrug-resistant TB, a level that has remained unchanged in recent years. The WHO highlighted the need for close detection and treatment gaps, fill funding shortfalls, and develop new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. The report says Bangladeshs National TB Programme budget is $48 million. Of it, less than 1 percent was domestically funded, 70 percent internationally funded and nearly 30 percent was unfunded. A TB control expert in Bangladesh said only 53 percent of TB infected people were estimated to be diagnosed while the others go undetected. “It is because there is one TB detection centre for every 2,00,000 people in Bangladesh. There should be one such centre for every 1,00,000 people,” he told The Daily Star. “A primary reason for detection and treatment gap is a major shortfall in funding,” said Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho, WHO assistant director-general for HIV, TB, malaria and neglected tropical diseases. This shortfall amounted to $1.4 billion this year. In addition, an annual funding gap of at least $1.3 billion must be filled for research that would include the development of new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, Winnie said.",{},"['estimated', 'situation', 'cases', 'million', 'report', 'global', 'funding', 'improves', 'detection', 'treatment', 'tb', 'bangladesh']","The TB situation, however, has not improved in Bangladesh where 81,000 died from TB last year, the figure was 80,000 the previous year.

Closing the gap,,,2014-12-01,The Daily Star,"THE vast majority of new HIV infections in the Asia–Pacific Region are occurring among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Nearly five million people were living with HIV in the Asia–Pacific Region in 2013 -- about one sixth of the global burden. There were an estimated 350,000 new HIV infections in the Region in 2013 -- the second-highest regional HIV burden after Sub-Saharan Africa. Partnerships between health systems and communities in the Region have improved access to life-saving treatment, increased domestic resources for HIV/AIDS programmes and reduced stigmatisation and discrimination. For example: Community organisations have helped formulate, implement and scale up the evidence-based recommendations contained in WHOs “Consolidated guidelines on HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations;” In India, the Avahan HIV programme helped strengthen community-based organisations, leading to a sharp decline in the epidemic in several high-prevalence states. The lessons learnt are being incorporated in the national response, helping to ensure sustainability; In China, the government is increasingly engaging with civil society organisations. Nongovernmental organisations such as AIDS Care China are providing a key bridge between government HIV programmes and key populations; The governments of the Philippines and Thailand, two of many countries where the MSM HIV epidemic is surging alarmingly, are working actively with MSM organisations that connect communities with HIV services. All of these examples fit the theme of World AIDS Day 2014: Closing the Gap. This theme is about empowering all people to access the services they need. Less than half of all HIV-positive people across the Asia-Pacific Region are aware of their status. An estimated 1.5 million people in the Region are receiving antiretroviral treatment -- about one third of the Regions HIV-positive population. This is a significant improvement compared with a few years ago, but the journey is less than half complete. WHO Member States can do better. It is only by closing testing and treatment gaps and reaching all in need that we can achieve our goal of ending AIDS in Asia by 2030. We need to overcome challenges. Key populations continue to face stigmatisation and discrimination, including punitive legislation. This must change. WHO consolidated guidelines are guided by human rights principles and call for governments to enforce protective laws to eliminate discrimination and violence faced by key populations. Evidence is adding to a dynamic response. Today, WHO has released a new update to recommend antiretrovirals as an emergency prevention intervention following possible HIV exposure for HIV-negative individuals, and to prevent and manage common opportunistic infections that affect many people living with HIV. We need more resources and wiser investments to address the HIV crisis in key populations. A renewed focus on HIV response needs to be articulated in the post-2015 health and development agenda. WHO works to improve the continuum of HIV prevention, treatment and care. We work hand in hand with key populations -- with a range of civil society organisations to help safeguard the health and well-being of millions of people. Ultimately, health is a human right.

The Prejudice of Service Providers,,,2013-05-24,The Daily Star,"Fatema is suffering from kidney stone complications but she has been refused surgery because she is HIV positive. “With all our referral cases we face this problem whenever they see our note where we mentioned specifically to practice universal precautions, which is standard procedure for doctors in general, they are warded off,” explains Dr Nilufar of AsharProdeep. “An unknown fear and stigma works for these doctors when they come to know that the patient is HIV positive. With the support of UNICEF we took gynaecologists, paediatricians and virologists to Thailand to see their treatment and care procedures. Once they understand then they feel confident about the treatment protocol of such patients. In my opinion it is easier to be infected with Hepatitis C or tuberculosis virus than HIV,” she adds. “In general an HIV positive person is treated with a judgmental attitude from health service providers irrespective of the nature of their health needs. It is seen that any health needs, particularly those associated with surgery where there are chances of bleeding, are avoided by the service providers. They are afraid of transmission of infection to themselves or infecting their instrument and other accessories in the operation theatre or other in-patient services. This could be easily prevented if the institutions adopt universal precaution services; which mean adequate sterilization of instruments and proper precaution of service providers for preventing cross transmission of any infection including hepatitis or HIV,” says Dr Ziya. “Its a standard mandatory procedure irrespective of giving service to a HIV positive person or not. In reality all the institutions of Bangladesh lack in proper universal precaution services and monitoring, so they are reluctant to provide surgical services to an HIV positive person. Its not a matter of any extra modern technology or instruments,” explains Dr Ziya. UNICEF is working to support services in the of PMTCT (Prevention of Maternal To Child Transmission), where they are raising awareness of clinicians, nurses and other staff, identifying pregnant HIV positive women and providing testing kits and other reagents, drugs, and support for proper deliveries of HIV positive mothers whether normal or Caesarean. The project also has components to advocate for other departments to expand services for infected women. We are hopeful that once we started the interventions, we will have more scope to interact with individual departments and administration as a whole to open up services for positive women,” Dr Ziya adds.

A global call to action for science-based drug policy,,,2010-07-03,The Daily Star,"Three leading scientific and health policy organisations recently launched a global drive for signatories to the Vienna Declaration (www.viennadeclaration.com), a statement seeking to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies. The Vienna Declaration is the official declaration of the XVIII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2010), the biennial meeting of more than 20,000 HIV professionals, taking place in Vienna, Austria from 18 to 23 July 2010 (www.aids2010.org). “Many of us in AIDS research and care confront the devastating impacts of misguided drug policies every day,” said AIDS 2010 Chair Dr. Julio Montaner, President of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and Director of the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. “These policies fuel the AIDS epidemic and result in violence, increased crime rates and destabilisation of entire states — yet there is no evidence they have reduced rates of drug use or drug supply. As scientists, we are committed to raising our collective voice to promote evidence-based approaches to illicit drug policy that start by recognising that addiction is a medical condition, not a crime.” The Vienna Declaration describes the known harms of conventional “war on drugs” approaches and states: “The criminalisation of illicit drug users is fuelling the HIV epidemic and has resulted in overwhelmingly negative health and social consequences. A full policy reorientation is needed… Reorienting drug policies towards evidence-based approaches that respect, protect and fulfill human rights has the potential to reduce harms deriving from current policies and would allow for the redirection of the vast financial resources towards where they are needed most: implementing and evaluating evidence-based prevention, regulatory, treatment and harm reduction interventions.” Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, injecting drug use accounts for approximately one in three new cases of HIV. In some areas of rapid HIV spread, such as Eastern Europe and Central Asia, injecting drug use is the primary cause of new HIV infections. Legal barriers to scientifically proven prevention services such as needle programmes and opioid substitution therapy (OST) mean hundreds of thousands of people become infected with HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) every year. The criminalisation of people who inject drugs has also resulted in record incarceration rates placing a massive burden on the taxpayer. HIV outbreaks have also been reported in prisons in various settings internationally. This emphasis on criminalisation produces a cycle of disease transmission, along with broken homes and livelihoods destroyed. Yet these costs, along with the more direct costs of the ‘war on drugs’, produce no measurable benefits. The Vienna Declaration calls on governments and international organisations, including the United Nations, to take a number of steps, including: • undertake a transparent review the effectiveness of current drug policies; • implement and evaluate a science-based public health approach to address the harms stemming from illicit drug use; • scale up evidence-based drug dependence treatment options; • abolish ineffective compulsory drug treatment centres that violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and • unequivocally endorse and scale up funding for the drug treatment and harm reduction measures endorsed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations. The declaration also calls for the meaningful involvement of people who use drugs in developing, monitoring and implementing services and policies that affect their lives. The effectiveness of opioid substitution therapy (OST) and needles and syringe programmes is well-documented, though access to such interventions is often limited where HIV is spreading most rapidly. According to various scientific reviews conducted by WHO, the US Institutes of Medicine and others, these programmes reduce HIV rates without increasing rates of drug use. These cost-effective interventions also produce significant savings in future health care costs, and help people who use drugs access health care and drug treatment. No evidence exists demonstrating negative consequences of use of these programmes. “Reflecting the AIDS 2010 theme of Rights Here, Right Now, the Vienna Declaration is rooted in the belief that global drug policy must respect the human rights of people who use drugs if it is to be at all effective,” said AIDS 2010 Local Co-Chair Dr. Brigitte Schmied, President of the Austrian AIDS Society. “No one who is familiar with addiction would deny the negative impacts it has on individuals, families and entire communities, but those harms do not justify human rights violations. People addicted to illicit drugs have the right to evidence-based drug treatment, to interventions to prevent infection, and, if they are living with HIV, to antiretroviral treatment.” Those wishing to sign on may visit www.viennadeclaration.com, where the full text of the declaration, along with a list of authors, is available.

First international AIDS conference ever held in Latin America,,,2008-03-08,The Daily Star,"Organisers of the XVII International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2008) - to be held in Mexico City from 3-8 August 2008 - announced the participation of 17 plenary speakers, including leading HIV scientists, community leaders, practitioners and policy experts from across the globe, says a press release. The theme of AIDS 2008 is Universal Action Now. ""AIDS 2008 is taking place at a unique moment in the epidemic, when there is widespread consensus on the need to ensure universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010,"" said AIDS 2008 Co-Chair Dr. Pedro Cahn, President of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and Fundación Huésped in Buenos Aires, Argentina. With over 25,000 participants expected, AIDS 2008 will be the first International AIDS Conference ever held in Latin America and is expected to increase awareness of the disease and its impact throughout the region. ""Latin America and the Caribbean have shown tremendous leadership - from the production of low cost HIV treatments, to innovative prevention campaigns and high levels of access to care - but we still have challenges,"" said AIDS 2008 Co-Chair Dr. Luis Soto-Ramírez, Head of the Molecular Virology Unit at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán and Coordinator of the Clinical Care Committee of CONASIDA. ""We look forward to learning with and from our colleagues from around the world."" Over 10,500 abstracts submitted More than half of all sessions will be scientific sessions based on abstracts submitted in one of five tracks. Organisers received over 10,500 submissions by the 19 February deadline. Other sessions to highlight key topics The conference is organised around three components: science, community and leadership. In addition to the abstract-driven programme, over the past year, organisers have designed 50 non-abstract driven sessions focusing on key issues within and across these three programme areas. Some of the many important issues to be addressed include: coping with AIDS in political crisis and conflict situations; mobile populations and globalisation; youth, sexual health and the impact of education on HIV vulnerability; and community involvement in HIV research. For the first time, the programme will include six regional sessions designed to focus attention on major issues within each region. The AIDS 2008 Opening Session will take place on Sunday, 3 August and will include Mexican government and international leaders, as well as community leaders representing people living with HIV and youth. Daily Special Sessions, held during the lunch hour, will feature high-level speakers (including Heads of State) and discussion of major issues on the horizon. One session will provide a report on the outcomes of the Positive Leadership Summit, a major international meeting of people living with HIV/AIDS, which is scheduled to take place in Mexico City just prior to AIDS 2008. Additional details about all sessions, including confirmed speakers, will be available through the conference website (www.aids2008.org) in June 2008. Programme activities planned for delegates and the general public In addition to sessions, AIDS 2008 also will feature a wide variety of activities, including some planned by and for youth, and a cultural programme that will showcase the relationship between AIDS, art and culture. Open to conference delegates and the general public, the AIDS 2008 Global Village will be a space to share lessons learned, knowledge and skills, and to build coalitions, and promote interactive learning among communities living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. The Global Village will be located at Las Americas Hippodrome, which is adjacent to Centro Banamex. Expanded access and online programming Conference organisers are again offering a two-tiered fee structure to make participation more affordable to delegates from low- and middle-income countries. Language access has also been expanded. Though English is the official language of the International AIDS Conference, for the first time simultaneous translation (English-Spanish) will be available at all sessions. The AIDS 2008 website is also available in both English and Spanish, and the Opening Session will offer simultaneous translations from English to all official U.N. languages (French, Arabic, Spanish, Mandarin and Russian). In order to make conference proceedings available to as wide an audience as possible, the AIDS 2008 website will include direct links to the full conference programme, including links to abstracts and related information, as well as speeches and slides, when available. Webcasts, podcasts and transcripts from all major sessions will again be produced by kaisernetwork.org, with Clinical Care Options, Inc. serving as the official online provider of scientific coverage. A new feature this year is the introduction of hubs, or remote viewing locations, where those who are unable to come to Mexico City will be able to attend local screenings of select sessions, along with local discussion.

Frozen Shoulder: symptoms you should know,Pain and stiffness can worsen over time until your shoulder feels frozen in one position. Here is how to get things moving again.,,2018-07-29,The Daily Star,"Pain and stiffness can worsen over time until your shoulder feels frozen in one position. Here is how to get things moving again. What is frozen shoulder? It is pain and stiffness in your shoulder that happens slowly. It can worsen until your shoulder seems “frozen” in one position. Although it may take as much as a few years to get completely better, it can improve long before then, especially if you do physical therapy to help with recovery. Causes Doctors do not know exactly what causes it, though some things make you more likely to have it. For example, it can happen if you can not move your shoulder very well because of an injury or surgery, or if you have diabetes, which can worsen symptoms and make them last longer. Thyroid problems, Parkinson’s disease, heart disease, and certain HIV medications also seem to raise your odds of getting frozen shoulder. Who gets it? It is most common if you are in your 50s or 60s, and it is rare for anyone under 40. Women get it more than men. And if you get frozen shoulder on one side of your body, you are up to 30% more likely to get it on the other side. Physical exam Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, injuries and medical history. Then s/he will check your shoulder. S/he will move it herself to see where the pain and stiffness start. This is your passive range of motion. Then s/he will ask you to move it yourself. That is your active range of motion. At the limit, it may feel like your arm is stuck. If you have frozen shoulder, your passive and active range of motion will be less than normal. Tests An “injection test” may help narrow down the cause of your symptoms. Your doctor gives you a shot in your arm that dulls the pain. With most shoulder problems, this gives you a bigger range of motion, but it will not change it much if you have frozen shoulder. Doctors typically only use imaging tests like X-rays, ultrasounds and MRIs to rule out other conditions. Exercises Once your frozen shoulder pain starts to ease up, your doctor might suggest arm exercises. A physical therapist can give you moves to do as homework. Take it easy at first. If you “push through the pain,” you could make things worse. Medicine NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen may curb pain and swelling. More powerful drugs called steroids are sometimes injected directly into the joint. But it can be tricky to get them into just the right spot, and even these will only provide temporary relief of your symptoms. Surgery Your doctor may suggest this, usually in the “frozen” stage, if nothing else works. There are two methods, sometimes used together. The first is manipulation while you are “asleep” from general anaesthesia. The surgeon moves the joint until it stretches or even tears the tissue. The second method, called arthroscopy, cuts the affected tissue directly. Your surgeon works through small cuts in your skin, using special tools. Recovery Frozen shoulder gets better for a lot of people within a year if they do physical therapy and use pain medicines and steroid shots if needed. Even without those methods, most people get better within a couple of years, though if you have diabetes, it may be harder to recover. Surgery works pretty well as long as you stick with your physical therapy afterward to rebuild and keep up your strength and mobility.",{},"['pain', 'doctor', 'things', 'symptoms', 'frozen', 'shoulder', 'worsen', 'range', 'physical', 'motion', 'works', 'know']","What is frozen shoulder?

Directly Observed HIV Treatment improves survival,,,2010-06-19,The Daily Star,"When applied to HIV care, the community-based model of directly observed therapy (DOT) has no effect on virologic outcomes, but significantly improves patient survival. This is according to researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in collaboration with colleagues at University of Cape Town, South Africa, who conducted the first randomised controlled trial of patient-nominated treatment-supporters providing partial DOT in resource-limited settings. The researchers found that mortality rates were lower among DOT patients than among self-monitored antiretroviral therapy (ART). The results are featured in the June 1, 2010, issue of AIDS. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is a treatment strategy commonly used in tuberculosis control programmes, in which a health care worker ensures that medication is taken by patients at health care facilities. Previous observational studies suggested the effectiveness of community health supporters (friends or family members) performing DOT antiretroviral therapy as a strategy to improve adherence, but data from randomised trials were previously lacking. “Community DOT-ART showed no effect on virologic outcomes, but was associated with greater CD4 cell count increases at 6-month follow up,” said Jean B. Nachega, MD, PhD, MPH, lead author of the study, associate scientist in the Bloomberg School’s Department of International Health. Nachega is also, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Infectious disease at Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.) For the study, researchers analysed data from 274 adult patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) at a public HIV clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were randomised to treatment-supporter DOT-ART or self -administered ART. In the DOT group, patients selected someone from their own personal network such as a family member or friend to observe at least one medication dose every day and provide support. DOT-ART patients and supporters received baseline and follow-up training and monitoring. “The `social capital´ provided by a trusted patient-nominated treatment supporter (e.g. material and emotional support, health care utilisation, etc.), may have contributed to save lives, regardless of the DOT component of our intervention” said Nachega. “Moving forward, there is a critical need to identify and assess additional community-based interventions to improve outcomes of HIV patients worldwide. We recommend these community-based DOT-ART interventions be large enough to detect meaningful clinical and public health differences that improve patients’ conditions and save lives. In addition, they should target patients with documented poor adherence and collect both qualitative and quantitative outcomes.”",{},"['care', 'town', 'health', 'south', 'observed', 'dot', 'therapy', 'hiv', 'outcomes', 'survival', 'researchers', 'improves', 'dotart', 'treatment', 'directly', 'patients']","When applied to HIV care, the community-based model of directly observed therapy (DOT) has no effect on virologic outcomes, but significantly improves patient survival.

Observing Zero Discrimination Day,Discrimination continues to undermine efforts to achieve a more just and equitable world and causes pain and suffering for many.,,2018-02-27,The Daily Star,"Discrimination continues to undermine efforts to achieve a more just and equitable world and causes pain and suffering for many. Discrimination has many forms, from racial or religious discrimination to discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation or age, and to bullying at school or at work. Discrimination remains widespread – gender, nationality, age, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or religion can all unfortunately be the basis for some form of discrimination. In only four out of 10 countries worldwide do equal numbers of girls and boys attend secondary school and 75 countries have laws that criminalize same-sex sexual relations. Many people face discrimination every day based on who they are or what they do. That no one should ever be discriminated against because of their age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, language, health (including HIV) status, geographical location, economic status or migrant status, or for any other reason is what UNAIDS is highlighting on Zero Discrimination Day. In December 2013, on World AIDS Day, UNAIDS, a UN program on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), launched its Zero Discrimination Campaign. From 2014 onward, every year on 1 March, people around the world join together to celebrate Zero Discrimination Day. The UN first celebrated Zero Discrimination Day on March 1, 2014. Discrimination in health-care settings also continues to be widely reported. Imagine a young woman newly diagnosed with HIV being told by her doctor that she must be sterilised, a sex worker facing violence or abuse from a nurse, a disabled person denied access to proper advice about their sexual health, a gay man frightened of disclosing his sexuality to medical staff, a person who injects drugs dying after being refused treatment or a transgender person attempting suicide after being turned away from a clinic. All of the aforementioned persons undergo the same stereotypical society and prejudices which make them fall victims to discrimination. The aim with which the zero discrimination day is observed, is to ensure that health-care settings be considered as safe and caring environments. However, such cases are happening too frequently throughout the world. Any obstacles that inhibit access to health-care facilities, including to testing, treatment and care services, must be removed. Access to health must be open to everyone.",{},"['discrimination', 'day', 'orientation', 'status', 'hiv', 'world', 'person', 'healthcare', 'observing', 'sexual', 'zero']","Discrimination has many forms, from racial or religious discrimination to discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation or age, and to bullying at school or at work.

"Public awareness, edn a must to fight AIDS in Asian region",,,2008-08-14,The Daily Star,"Speakers at a seminar in the port city yesterday underscored the need for proper education among the women to create competent leadership for fighting AIDS and social problems prevailing in the South and South East Asian region. Asian University of Women (AUW) organised the seminar on Leadership in a time of crisis: A personal journey in the campaign against HIV/AIDS in Malaysia at a local hotel. Datin Paduka Marina Mahathir, daughter of former prime minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohammad and a prominent journalist, presented a keynote speech as the chief guest. Former adviser to a caretaker government and Chairman of AUW Bangladesh Advisory Board Rokia Afzal Rahman and member Monowara Hakim Ali were present as the special guests at the seminar. AUW Director (Planning and Logistics) architect Zarina Hossain and Dean of AUW Access Academy Helen Claire Sievers also spoke. Marina Mahathir in her speech said public awareness and proper education is key to fight AIDS that has become an alarming issue in different countries in the region. In Malaysia, around 80,000 people have so far been identified as HIV positives since 1985, she presented a data, adding that the number was only 6,000 when she started her campaign in 1993 and the number rose to 36,000 in 2000. Terming ignorance of the people and their negligence to learn about the fatal disease as main reason behind such rise of the disease in her country, Marina, who was elected president of the Malaysian AIDS Council for six terms, said they had not started the public awareness programme earlier. Marina said learning is a very journey but its also very worthy, and we should not neglect our life since its short but an invaluable gift too. “One of the most important components to fight HIV/Aids in this region is religion because religious people can play a vital role in the campaign against the fatal disease,” she added. She observed that a purposeful and coordinated effort in creating public awareness against AIDS by different local and foreign non-government organisations has helped control the rise of AIDS in Bangladesh. Sharing her experience while working in different sectors, Rokia mentioned that a dramatic change has taken place in the female education sector in the country since the liberation war in 1971. At present around 60 percent female students are getting enrolment in the primary education, while it was only 30 percent during the 70s, she said, adding that while it was very difficult for the NGOs to employ educated female workers for different development activities in 1980s, now they can easily find many highly educated females with BBA and MBA degrees. Knowledge brings a lot of confidence among the female as well as to make them capable for different jobs, she said. Laying emphasis on women empowerment, Rokia said, “We now want the girls to be educated to ensure women empowerment.” Praising the efficiency that the students of the first batch of AUW have achieved in last four months since they started their course in April this year, Rokia hoped that they would definitely be the future leaders in the region. AUW Access Academy Executive Director Dr B Regina Papa said the university has an international outlook but it would reflect the aspirations of the people in Asia. Dr Dil Afroze Quader, special adviser to the vice chancellor of AUW, gave the vote of thanks.",{},"['female', 'region', 'women', 'edn', 'auw', 'education', 'aids', 'different', 'started', 'asian', 'malaysia', 'awareness', 'fight', 'public', 'rokia']",Speakers at a seminar in the port city yesterday underscored the need for proper education among the women to create competent leadership for fighting AIDS and social problems prevailing in the South and South East Asian region.

In Hell and Home,,,2000-01-21,The Daily Star,"Pale and exhausted, a man in his mid-twenties rests in a shabby room of a worn out hospital. He eats, urinates and sleeps in the same room, completely isolated from the rest of mankind. Three policemen stand guard around the clock to make sure he doesnt escape. Solitary confinement has been imposed on the man since he tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes to AIDS. Maung was arrested for illegal fishing off the coast of Mongla and tossed into Chittigongs central jail. He was transferred to Infectious Disease Hospital in Mahakhali after he tested positive four years ago. ""I dont know why I am locked up here, but I know I have the AIDS virus,"" said Maung, who has a six-year-old daughter back in Myanmar. Myanmar officials visited Maung three times, but denied that he was a citizen. ""When I left my house for fishing I had told my wife I would be back with enough money to feed us, but I guess I wont see my family ever again."" In New Delhi, Lian Sang, 33, leads a cheerful life in a mens dormitory, despite his HIV positive status. Sang, who hails from the state of Manipur in north eastern India, used to be addicted to heroin. He thinks he contracted the fatal virus from the needles he shared with other drug users. However, Sang kicked his heroin habit three years when he arrived at Sarah house, a home for people with mild mental illness, drug addiction or HIV. Sang is married with two children. His five-year-old daughter tested positive a couple of months ago and now lives with her brother in an NGO operated home for children in the city. ""Sarah has given me a life full of joy,"" said Sang. ""I feel so confident about life that I sometimes forget that I am an HIV positive. ""Before coming to Sarah, I was very weak and scared and thought I would die pretty soon but I no longer believe that. There is life even if you are HIV positive."" Sarahs residents enjoy a much different life than Maungs isolation. The management finds jobs for patients in good health. They also emphasise regular exercise so they remain active and strengthen their muscles. There are special lessons on vocational training and basic health care. Severely ill patients are provided with and individualised diet rich in vitamins. The environment resembles a university dormitory. A stranger wouldnt know the difference unless told about their illness. The 80 residents are also friends who help each other make the beds and tidy the house. Nobody feels sorry for themselves; most dont want to be called patients. ""About 30 per cent of those living here, including some Bangladeshis, are HIV positive, but we dont treat them as HIV patients,"" said Neville Selhore, Sarahs 17-year-old director. ""We have no specialist here. The important thing here is everyone learns to live together with the risk of contracting a disease like AIDS."" Meanwhile, Maung waits for the inevitable, while his family wonders what happened. However, there is some hope. The Rotary Club of Dhaka and the Christian Commission for Development in Bangladesh have established a pilot project that is helping Naung in various ways.",{},"['virus', 'hell', 'positive', 'tested', 'sang', 'know', 'house', 'hiv', 'life', 'maung', 'patients']","Solitary confinement has been imposed on the man since he tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes to AIDS.

AIDS pioneers and cancer scientist win Nobel prize,,,2008-10-11,The Daily Star,"Two French scientists who discovered the AIDS virus and a German who bucked conventional wisdom to find a virus that causes cervical cancer were awarded the 2008 Nobel prize for medicine this year. Luc Montagnier, director of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention, and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi of the Institut Pasteur won half the prize of 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.4 million) for discovering the virus that has killed 25 million people since it was identified in the 1980s. Dr. Harald zur Hausen of the University of Duesseldorf and a former director of the German Cancer Research Center shared the other half of the prize for work that went against the established opinion about the cause of cervical cancer. ""The three laureates have discovered two new viruses of great importance and the result of that has led to an improved global health,"" said Jan Andersson, a member of the Nobel Assembly at Swedens Karolinska Institute. The discoveries made it possible to diagnose both infections, and led to the development of two vaccines that prevent cervical cancer, and more than 20 drugs that can keep HIV patients healthy. The award is a decisive vote for Montagnier in a long-running dispute over who discovered and identified the virus, Montagnier or Dr. Robert Gallo, then of the U.S. National Cancer Institute. ""There was no doubt as to who made the fundamental discoveries,"" Nobel Assembly member Maria Masucci told news agency Reuters. The International AIDS Society (IAS), the worlds leading independent association of HIV professionals, with more than 10,000 members from 180 countries extends its congratulations to Françoise Barré-Sinoussi on a remarkable achievement as she is jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 2008, and recognised for her role in the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus, and also for her significant contribution to HIV/AIDS research. IAS President Julio Montaner and IAS Executive Director Craig McClure jointly showered praise on Professor Barré-Sinoussi: “Françoise is deeply committed and passionate about the fight against HIV. Her work in the laboratory that led to the discovery of the virus has obviously changed the course of medical history and is an outstanding contribution to science. Her career as a basic scientist is matched by her compassion and kindness towards people living with and affected by HIV throughout the world.” Cancer discovery Zur Hausen was recognised for finding that the human papilloma virus, or HPV, caused cervical cancer. ""More than 5 percent of all cancers worldwide are caused by persistent infection with this virus,"" the Nobel committee said. The virus, which infects at least half of all sexually active adults, can also cause genital warts, cancer of the penis and other genitalia. The German scientist, who began his research in the 1970s, searched for different HPV types, detecting them in 70 percent of cervical tumor samples from around the world. An estimated 500,000 women are diagnosed with the disease each year and about 300,000 die from it, mostly in the developing world. Zur Hausen said he thought more cancers would be linked to viruses. ""I suspect there will be more in the future,"" he said.",{},"['virus', 'win', 'scientist', 'cancer', 'montagnier', 'hiv', 'million', 'cervical', 'led', 'pioneers', 'prize', 'aids', 'research', 'nobel']","Two French scientists who discovered the AIDS virus and a German who bucked conventional wisdom to find a virus that causes cervical cancer were awarded the 2008 Nobel prize for medicine this year.

Life expectancy up 5.5 yrs: WHO,"Global life expectancy grew by 5.5 years between 2000 and 2016, the World Health Organization said yesterday, warning though that unequal income and access to healthcare translates into far shorter lives for many.",,2019-04-05,The Daily Star,"Global life expectancy grew by 5.5 years between 2000 and 2016, the World Health Organization said yesterday, warning though that unequal income and access to healthcare translates into far shorter lives for many. The UN health agency also stressed significant gender differences in life expectancy worldwide. On average, a child born in 2016 can expect to live 72 years, up from 66.5 in 2000, according to the annual World Health Statistics report. The first 16 years of the century saw dramatic drops in deaths among children under five, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has been made against malaria, measles and other communicable diseases, WHO said. Life expectancy has also increased thanks to advances against HIV/AIDS, which ravaged much of Africa in the 1990s. But despite progress in poorer countries, WHO said there remained significant life expectancy gaps between developed and developing nations. People in low-income countries live 18 fewer years on average than those in high-income nations, statistics showed. In Lesotho, for instance, people on average live to be just 52, or 53 in the Central African Republic 53 years of age, compared to over 83 for Switzerland and over 84 in Japan. While most people who die in rich countries are old, nearly one in three deaths in poorer countries are children under five, WHO said.

IAS calls for action instead of rhetoric at UN meeting on AIDS,,,2008-06-07,The Daily Star,"The International AIDS Society (IAS) yesterday urged government and fellow civil society leaders attending the upcoming UN High Level Meeting on AIDS to address the gap between commitments and results on universal access to HIV prevention, care and treatment interventions. IAS President Dr Pedro Cahn noted that the upcoming UN High Level Meeting, to be held 10 - 11 June in New York, was the last opportunity for the international community to review progress in meeting commitments made in the 2001 Declaration of Commitment and 2006 Political Declaration. A June 2nd report, released by WHO, UNAIDS and UNICEF, revealed that, although progress is improving in areas such as access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and care and treatment services for women and children, most countries are far off target to reach universal access by 2010, and most people living with HIV remain unaware that they are infected. ART coverage remains unacceptably low at roughly 31% of people in need of treatment, and many countries are still not engaging populations most vulnerable to HIV, such as sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM) and injecting drug users (IDUs) in their national HIV plans. Women and girls bear the brunt of the epidemic, due to their biological and social vulnerability to HIV infection. And while services to prevent mother to child transmission have increased, they continue to remain woefully inadequate. And for every two people who start antiretroviral therapy five become newly infected. ""This meeting is an opportunity for countries to be accountable for the commitments they have made, to place evidence over ideology and action over political expediency"", said Dr Cahn. ""The Secretary General himself has indicated progress to date is insufficient to meet universal access targets, and that legal barriers are impeding progress to reaching vulnerable populations. This is the last opportunity for governments to remove those barriers and for the international community to come together on a global health crisis that has already claimed over 25 million lives"".

,,,,,"One billion adolescents: The right to health, information and services By Tahiat-E-Mahboob All young people have a right to health, including reproductive health, and the information and services to make this right a reality. This is especially urgent in the fight against FHV/AIDS. UNFPA supports national efforts to ensure that young people can make informed, responsible decisions and lead healthy, productive lives."" -Thoraya Obaid, Executive Director, UNFPA July 11 was declared as World Population Day (WPD). The organisation that holds the reigns in creating awareness about world population around the world, better known as the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), is now carrying on a full-fledged program that not only creates awareness all over the world but also helps people through better knowledge and proper educational guidance on improving productive health status, women empowerment and no doubt the importance of world population, etc. Each year has its own theme and as the name and the words of Thoraya Obaid, Executive Director, UNFPA suggests, this years theme is: Adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights. More than one billion young people are between the ages of 15 and 24. They need supportive relationships and respect. In return, the world needs their active participation. 1000,000,000 adolescents are about to enter their reproductive years in 2003. It is a critical time for all and a fatal one for most. This is because due to lack of proper, guidance, education and knowledge adolescents all over the world are not aware of reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and their own rights regarding these matters. Over 500,000 women die in pregnancy and childbirth- many young girls. Fifty percent of all new HIV infections are among young people especially girls. The UNFPA works to ensure safe passage into adulthood for millions of young people. At the International Parliamentarians Conference (IPCI/ICPD) in Ottawa, Canada, elected representatives from 72 countries and territories pledged to save adolescents lives by giving them the education, opportunities and services that are vital for their health. This pledge is a part of UNFPAs mission: protect and empower the young to safeguard humanitys future. Based on this years theme (Adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights) WPD will focus on mainly three areas: Adolescent reproductive health HIV/AIDS Youth Participation. The UNFPAs aim this year is to teach teenagers and adolescents about reproductive health and HIV and encourage them to participate. With limited knowledge about their bodies, adolescents are vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, exploitation and violence. Both girls and boys suffer when denied access to needed information and services. Early marriage often leads to early childbearing, which not only limits life opportunities but also carries serious health risks. HIV/AIIDS can only be stopped by educating, empowering and mobilizing young people. Every day nearly 6,000 young people become infected with HIV. Young women and adolescent girls are highly vulnerable. Prevention works. Trends are reversing where national programs aim to prevent infection among young people. Most of the worlds young people live in developing areas. Young people can shape the future of their countries. They are making a difference as peer educators helping others avoid unwanted pregnancy and STIs, as actors in plays on HIV/AIDS prevention, and as speakers asking politicians to listen. They need a voice in decisions that affect their lives. And the UNFPA is working to create that voice specially through the World Population Day this year to make adolescents aware. The UNFPA has already seen success. In Mongolia, all secondary schools are now required to teach a course on sexuality education, designed by local professionals with UNFPA support. In Sierra Leone, UNFPA is providing life-saving information and services to females of all ages who were abducted and raped during the conflict and to other war-effected youth as well. After the civil war, the country faces new enemy in HIV/AIDS. Young peoples involvement also shaped an important National Adolescent and Youth Policy for the Dominican Republic. Invited to participate in the drafting process, carried out with UNFPA support, young people gained recognition as a national resource and positive force. Bangladesh is probably not far away from reaching similar success. And to bring this about, the organisation has arranged a series of activities and programs that begin on the 9th of July with discussions, round table discussions with young people (10 July), debates and TV program and then culminate on 12th July in a rally that starts from Ramna Park and ends at the National Museum where the State Minister of Youth will speak. People are free to participate in the rally. So show that you care about your health, your country, your world- join the march to awareness and make it a success. Real success stories inspire action. UNFPA is collecting summaries of reproductive health activities showing positive results, whether with governments, NGOs, schools, community groups or individuals.

Everywhere -- at home, in schools and colleges, at workplaces --- we are surrounded by electronic gadgets that rule our lives. They are so addicting that some of us cannot even think of living without these. But what happens when these devices go temporarily out of order? Take the Internet for instance. Browsing, mailing, chatting through the Internet has become an essential part of our everyday life. In the present age, even children are getting addicted to the Internet. The world of cyberspace is totally different from our real world. It is a place where we let ourselves loose and communicate with different people across the globe. (Hmm� pretty cool way of socializing!) Some people are now forgetting other pass-times and hobbies and are practically living on the computer -- in their ""cyber worlds"". One day without the Internet may sometimes drive people crazy. ""Oh dear, I wont be able to check mail!"" or ""Oh my goodness! It seems that I havent talked to my MSN pals for ages"" -- could be the remarks of these distressed people. Similarly, we have become so much dependent on the computer that some of us stay glued onto the computer screen for hours together. The usual activities comprise of watching movies, listening to music, playing games and such. People even do their office work, assignments, homework, schools projects etc. on the computer. Imagine the pain of writing out your school projects by hand, if your computer was not working. Another essential but addicting device is the telephone. ""Ring, ring�."" -- oh, there is another call. It may be an important call or a call from a friend just to chat. There are people who sit with the phone, chatting and gossiping for hours. Then again if your phone is out of order, you may miss necessary phone calls or miss the long chats with your friends. The advent of cell phones has furthered the chatting spree. Now calling people and talking to them is possible from nearly every nook and corner of the world. The television, another outstanding invention is surely an effective media, which keeps us enlightened about the worldly affairs. The news channels and some of the other channels keep us well informed about the world, but now a days more and more entertainment channels are being introduced. Thus TV has become a major form of entertainment for people of all ages and groups. It is because of the different movies, soap operas, talk shows and such other programmes, that people have become hooked onto this electronic media. I think that there are countless people who sit and watch TV practically all day long, not willing to miss a single programme. It is almost becoming impossible to live without these electronic gadgets, in this age. We are becoming so dependent upon these that even if they are plugged off for a few minutes, we start feeling restless. They are dominating our lives. It is okay to use these for entertaining us for a short period of our leisure time, but actually we have dedicated our entire free time to these devices. It is very true that nowadays, we are becoming so busy that we cannot even find enough space in our tight schedules, to include some family time. But even the minimal amount of leisure time we do get is spent either in front of the TV watching a serial or in front of the computer logged onto the Internet. These electronic media are turning out to be isolating devices, which binds us around themselves and thus discouraging us from spending our leisure time in other ways. Lost are the good old days when people used to spend their leisure time with their families, either by going out somewhere or just by sitting at home conversing amongst themselves. Now even if people have some time left for spending with their families, most of them usually sit in front of the TV watching the various programmes. You may ask what is wrong with watching a good programme with your family? Yes, in that way you would be spending time with your family, but how are you enjoying ""family time"" when all you are doing is just sitting in front of the TV, watching the programme and hardly even saying a word to each other. So family or no family does not make much difference. Today this how people define ""quality family time"". (Maybe naming the television an ""idiot box"" was the right thing after all!) The world today has become a totally ""wired"" place. There are electronic gadgets and wires everywhere. It is almost like living in a series circuit, so that if these gadgets are unplugged, our lives get plugged out too! But the sad truth is that we are seriously becoming entangled in this vicious mesh of wires, that it is almost equivalent to being held captives, far away from our families and relatives. The network of wires we are tangled in have now bound us very tightly. It is high time now that we disentangle ourselves from this web. I do not mean to completely stop using these gadgets, but to limit ourselves from getting too much absorbed into them. Book Review Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix By Tahiat-E-Mahboob The good news is I have read it! The bad news is a lot of you have not! So here I am to provide you with an appetizer so that when you do get your copy, the feast will be more enjoyable. No do not worry! I am not going to spoil it for you. The fifth book in line, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix starts off from where it left in the Goblet of Fire. This book is bigger, badder (gosh my pathetic English!) and fatter with seven sixty-six pages and thirty-eight chapters. The first thing that happened to me was that I finally fell in love with Harry Potter especially now that he has turned fifteen and all. And from the book it seems so have others. The second thing that happened was that I also fell in love with Sirius Black. Hes like one of those James Bond, Hugh Jackman, Wolverine and David Copperfield combinations that knock you out like a lethal injection! Third, you simply cant put the book down. J.K. Rowlings has put in more knots into the plot than any Gordian and French knot combined (whatever thats supposed to mean!) Fourth, for a while Harry does knock his head (metaphorically duh!) and does some stupid things and thinks some stupid thoughts that make me detest him for a teeny winy while in the course of the book. Fifth, remember that obnoxious teacher that you always hated in school? Well Rowlings has certainly introduced a certain Dolores Jane Umbridge to get Harry acquainted with how you feel. Trust me, next to her, Snape is a grouchy wet teddy bear with a bad hairdo. That being said, remember what potter said to Dumbledore in the Goblet of Fire about Volde- oops You-Know-Who coming back? Well, that is exactly what the story is compounded on. I wont say that you must read it because duh! Does that need to be said- of course you have to read it. So get a copy NOW! Its available at Etcetra and mind you it costs a pretty penny (1600 bucks!) Now dont be stingy!",{},"['reproductive', 'tv', 'health', 'family', 'lives', 'computer', 'world', 'unfpa', 'population', 'young']",,https://www.thedailystar.net/rising/2003/07/03/special.htm
HIV testing critical to end AIDS,,,2012-12-01,The Daily Star,"Ten years ago, the idea of elimination of HIV would have sounded like a pipedream. However, this is now considered a realistic goal due to substantial progress made through years of commitment, investment and collective action. New HIV infections now show a declining trend globally. All 11 countries in WHOs South-East Asia Region showed a decline by 34% in the past decade. The overall decline in the Region is cause for increased optimism; however complacency now could become our greatest enemy. Those most â€œat riskâ€ of HIV are disproportionately affected by the disease and are also among the least empowered. They include the youth, those who inject drugs, female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people and migrants. Zero new HIV infections and zero AIDS-related deaths by 2015 can be achieved through greater efforts directed towards â€œat riskâ€ populations to encourage increased testing. HIV prevention services for these people need to be expanded to battle the concentrated epidemic found in this Region. The role of HIV testing and counselling is extremely important to ensure knowledge of a persons HIV status. It is also the entry point to HIV care and treatment services. Furthermore it offers access to HIV prevention information which can persuade people who are at-risk to change their behaviour and reduce the risk. Today a person infected with HIV can remain healthy and live longer with antiretroviral therapy. They can also take measures to prevent spreading the virus to others. However the â€œmost at-riskâ€ population are reluctant to approach HIV testing and counselling services, so large numbers are not aware of their HIV status, and many continue to become HIV infected. In this Region most â€œat riskâ€ populations remain highly marginalised and vulnerable to HIV. The HIV epidemic among them is either long established and largely unresolved or newly emerging and rising at an alarming rate. Overall, South-East Asia still has a significant problem of injecting drug use, with estimated 4,50,000-5,00,000 drug injectors. Many drug injectors become HIV infected due to sharing contaminated needles. Due to the stigma, only a minority of HIV-infected drug injectors receive treatment. Despite a gradual decline in the general population, HIV prevalence among them remains high, ranging from 9% in India to 36% in Indonesia. More than 50% of drug injectors are co-infected with HIV and Hepatitis C in many countries in South-East Asia. Harm reduction programmes need to be expanded to halt the spread of HIV among drug injectors. Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people continue to have an alarmingly high and rising HIV prevalence rate in the Region as well. One in three MSM are reported HIV infected in Bangkok, while 9 states in India have more than 5% HIV prevalence among MSM. Unless HIV prevention measures are improved, it is likely that a substantial growth of new HIV infections in the Region could be among MSM. However many MSM face stigma and discrimination which prevents health-seeking behaviour. Criminalisation of same sex behaviour promotes risk, prevents MSM from accessing prevention measures and exacerbates social inequalities making them vulnerable to HIV infection. Addressing the health needs of at-risk populations can be challenging when laws and practices criminalise populations at highest risk for HIV, and deter them from HIV prevention and care services. We know what needs to be done for halting and reversing the HIV epidemic among the vulnerable and those at highest risk. There it is an urgent need to scale-up services. We need to expand HIV testing and counselling; involve affected and infected communities for spreading awareness about knowing ones HIV status and enrolment into care for those who test positive. Ongoing support and care is critical as more and more HIV-positive people on treatment live longer. Prevention benefits of early treatment are well established and all the more pertinent for at-risk populations and their partners. The health sector needs to provide more inclusive services for these communities, to promote and support legal and social frameworks that are rights based and consistent with public health and HIV prevention goals. WHO continues to advance and update evidence on newer technologies and treatment initiatives in collaboration with country programmes and other stakeholders to ensure that we move together and faster towards the end of AIDS.

The role of HIV testing and counselling is extremely important to ensure knowledge of a person's HIV status. Furthermore it offers access to HIV prevention information which can persuade people who are at-risk to change their behaviour and reduce the risk. However the â€œmost at-riskâ€ population are reluctant to approach HIV testing and counselling services, so large numbers are not aware of their HIV status, and many continue to become HIV infected. We need to expand HIV testing and counselling; involve affected and infected communities for spreading awareness about knowing one's HIV status and enrolment into care for those who test positive.",https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-259427
"With assistance, we can take dramatic turnaround",,,2013-05-29,The Daily Star,"At age 16, Prarthana, from a remote village in Chittagong, was forced by her impoverished parents to marry Biplob, a returnee overseas migrant. What she did not know was that he had acquired HIV during his stay abroad, although his parents and friends were aware. They had suggested that Biplob marry an underage girl to “get rid of” the HIV. Within a year, Prarthana and Biplob (all names changed to protect privacy) had a child. A few months thereafter, Biplob died of AIDS. Subsequently, both Prarthana and the baby were found to be HIV-positive. After Biplobs death and this diagnosis, both Prarthanas own parents and in-laws began to stigmatize and discriminate against Prarthana. From sheer lack of food, medicine or extended family support, the baby soon died as well. Prarthana herself was near death before the Ashar Alo Society (AAS), a key partner of the United Nations, found her and offered food and shelter at its Dhaka-based centre supported by the Joint Programme on Violence Against Women. Through the centre, Prarthana received income-generation training co-sponsored by AAS and the United Nations. Later, she received 10,000 Taka (about US$125) as a one-time grant to start her own business in home-based poultry and goat rearing. A total of 145 other HIV-positive women have received similar grants Today, at age 20, Prarthana now enjoys an inspirational life story: She has recently found a life partner of her choice, and she and her husband are happily married and living in the Sylhet region. To help support the couple, she is making a living through poultry farming as a result of the Joint Programme.",{},"['support', 'poultry', 'partner', 'women', 'biplob', 'parents', 'prarthana', 'programme', 'received', 'assistance', 'united', 'turnaround', 'dramatic']","At age 16, Prarthana, from a remote village in Chittagong, was forced by her impoverished parents to marry Biplob, a returnee overseas migrant.
