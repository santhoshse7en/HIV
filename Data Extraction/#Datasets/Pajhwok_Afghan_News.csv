18 AIDs cases in total detected in Takhar,"TALOQAN (Pajhwok): At least two new Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases have been detected in in northern Takhar province, taking the total number of patients infected to 18, health officials said on Thursday.",h.ghanizada,2015-09-03,,"TALOQAN (Pajhwok): At least two new Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases have been detected in in northern Takhar province, taking the total number of patients infected to 18, health officials said on Thursday. The officials expressed concerns that patients with lack of knowledge about the deadly disease of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) could spread among families. Dr. Hafizullah Sapi, provincial health director, said two individuals a male and a female diagnosed with the disease were the residents of Rostaq and Darqad districts. He said the HIV positive man had lost his life in Takhar prison and they were searching for his family members. According to Sapi, he was imprisoned in Tajikistan and was later transferred to Takhar to complete his jail term. “We are worried about the health of his other family members. But he never gave us a proper address. He was also addicted to drugs,” Sapi recalled. About the second case, he said, a woman in Sarqand district was found positive during medical check up. She had four children as well. “We want her other family members checked,” he said. According to Sapi, the disease spread to other parts of the province from Iran, Tajikistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries. HIV/AIDS is a viral and non-curable disease and spread after sexual intercourse, tainted injections, and barber’s instruments. He also said Takhar civil hospitals did not have facilities for HIV AIDs test and the addicted patients of this virus should go to other places for laboratory test and treatment. Sapi added no medicine has been created so far to eliminate HIV AIDs virus and it is a non-treatable illness. He, however, said there was one unit in Kunduz hospital on zone level where this virus could be tested. According to Sapi the HIV AIDs virus destroy the anti-body system in human body and then pave the way for other dangerous diseases such as fever and ultimately cause the death. Dr. Mir Karimullah Zia, head of a foreign NGO, said they dispatched special teams to the district health centres to take blood samples of other individuals for check up. He said with the repatriation of refugees such life threatening diseases entered Afghanistan . The official termed the spread of HIV AIDs dangerous and urged for preventive measures. hg/rm",{},"['takhar', 'virus', 'sapi', 'disease', '18', 'spread', 'members', 'total', 'patients', 'detected', 'cases', 'aids', 'hiv', 'health']","TALOQAN (Pajhwok): At least two new Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases have been detected in in northern Takhar province, taking the total number of patients infected to 18, health officials said on Thursday.

Dr. Mohammad Liaqat Adil, speaking at a conference “Let’s rescue our work force from AIDS” in Jalalabad, said unemployment had increased in the country, giving rise poverty and HIV/AIDS cases. He assailed the government, particularly the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), for launching effective public awareness programmes despite spending a lot of money on eradicating HIV/AIDS. A large number of returning Afghan refugees also contributed to increasing unemployment, an issue that needed serious attention from the government, the senior trade unionist said. But a doctor at the Nangarhar Public Health Department, Noor Hassan Basharyar, said the government had made remarkable efforts for eliminating HIV and AIDS and public awareness on the issue had increased. He added besides the public awareness programmes, the MoPH had also launched other initiatives for the prevention of the deadly disease in society , detention centers, drug addicts using injections and transmission of the virus from affected mothers to their babies. Public awareness has been spread to 11,000 school students, 2,500 university students and people at a large number of public places, like public toilets, in Nangarhar province, Hassan said. However, social discrimination against the HIV-affected people is great challenge, but the MoPH this year plans to launch a conference under ‘Please stop discrimination’ on World AIDS Day.

ADB to pursue 5 priorities under long-term strategy,"YOKOHAMA (Pajhwok): The 50th Board of Governors Conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ended on Monday, with a promise to consider five priorities as part of a long-term strategy of the institution.",nuddin,2017-05-15,,"YOKOHAMA (Pajhwok): The 50th Board of Governors Conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ended on Monday, with a promise to consider five priorities as part of a long-term strategy of the institution. After several meetings, conferences, seminars and media events, ADB’s President Takehiko Nakao noted progress in the Asia Pacific. However, he acknowledged challenges still remained. In Asia 330 million people still live in absolute poverty on less than $1.90 a day. Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and climate actions and collective priorities for Asian economies, the bank has started discussing its long-term strategy, whose five priorities are to be considered: 1. Infrastructuredevelopment: This remains ADBs top priority. A recent report by the bank found that $1.7 trillion per year through 2030 is needed in investments in power, transport, telecommunications, and water for the regions development. ""This is more than double our previous estimate, reflecting additional investments needed to support continued growth and address climate change,"" said Nakao. 2. Support for poorest and fragile countries and inclusiveness: While progress in Asia has been impressive, health and education are top on the list of ADBs development goals. ""In health, we will support universal healthcare systems and cross-border initiatives to combat communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. In education, we will continue to support Technical and Vocational Education and Training, or TVET, and help improve the quality of secondary education,"" he said. 3. Gender equality: Nakao said they would strengthen their gender equality work since ""gender is a cross-cutting issue that influences all social and economic processes."" It will design projects that help women and girls secure higher skills, better health, more jobs and a larger voice in decision making. 4. Using private resources for development, the ADB aims to promote greater and more effective use of public–private partnerships (PPPs). It is also financing projects by private companies working on solar, wind and geothermal power infrastructure, highways, telecommunications and ports, as well as projects in education, health, and agriculture and further still the ADB priorities are funding micro, small and medium sized enterprises through local banks. 5. ADB will ensure reforms to better conduct its work in the most efficient way. ""ADB will strengthen its sector and thematic expertise, enhance staff capacity and streamline procedures. We will deepen our collaboration with civil society , academia, the private sector and local authorities,"" Nakao promised. nh/pr/mud",{},"['adb', 'strategy', 'longterm', 'education', 'projects', 'nakao', 'gender', 'pursue', 'support', 'development', 'priorities', 'health', 'private']","YOKOHAMA (Pajhwok): The 50th Board of Governors Conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ended on Monday, with a promise to consider five priorities as part of a long-term strategy of the institution.

Afghanistan committed to eradicating polio: Feroz,"WASHINGTON (Pajhwok): The Afghan government is ‘passionately committed’ to eradicating polio from the country, a top Afghan health",Ali,2016-06-23,,"WASHINGTON (Pajhwok): The Afghan government is ‘passionately committed’ to eradicating polio from the country, a top Afghan health official said Thursday. The public health minister acknowledged insecurity, inaccessibility and unacceptability posed major hurdles to address the challenge of polio eradication effort. Ferozuddin Feroz told a Washington audience that Afghanistan was among the only two countries in the world where the crippling disease was still rife. Noting that six polio cases have been detected so far in Afghanistan, Feroz said the Afghan government was working on a strategy to contain the virus. At the same time, he said, insurgents were not letting health workers to reach certain parts of the county. “Then there is also false believe that polio is a non-Islamic thing,” the minister said in response to a question at the Wilson Center, a top American think-tank. In addition to working on a community program, Feroz said the Afghan government has engaged religious leaders to talk about the acceptability of polio drops. “I am sure with these efforts, we would not only be able to contain polio, but also eradicate it,” the minister said. The event at Wilson Center was held to release results of the first-ever Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), the international “gold standard” assessment tool used by over 90 countries to evaluate a population’s health and disseminate nationally representative data on fertility, family planning, maternal and child health, gender, HIV/AIDs, and nutrition. Referring to the survey results, Feroz said there has been considerable progress in the health sector and significant improvement in various health parameters including child and women mortality. At the same time, he acknowledged there is a long way to go. Afghanistan’s health sector, he said, is heavily dependent on donor countries and out of pocket payment by Afghan population. “We are not sure that (foreign) financial assistance would continue any longer. Therefore the Afghan Government is working on generating its own resources,” he said and listed out a proposed tax on tobacco products as one such example. The introduction of tax on tobacco products, Feroz said is estimated to generate a revenue of USD 30 million per annum. The Afghan government is also planning to introduce various social security including health insurance as a pilot projects in Afghanistan, he said. “There is substantial improvement in maternal health…., vaccination coverage has increased,” he said adding that these progress have been made through high level commitment, scaling up of cost effective and live savings Despite these progress, Afghanistan faces many challenges, including insecurity and inaccessibility and dependence on external assistance. “We are in the process of developing national strategy for next five year,” Feroz said. Participating the panel discussion, Sayed Alam Shinwari, president of the Afghan Medical Professionals Association of America said only 30 percent of the work has been accomplished in the country’s health sector, and 70 percent of the work is still left. “It required contributions from everyone. As we supported the country in last decade, let’s support Afghanistan in the next 15 years to make Afghanistan self-sufficient in the health sector,” Dr Shinwari said. Reiterating that the US is committed to support Afghanistan in the long term, Larry Sampler, Assistant to the Administrator for the Office for Afghanistan and Pakistan at USAID , said that the country need for a healthy population of the country. The US strategy, he asserted, is aimed at helping the Afghan Government providing quality health care to the people of Afghanistan.

Infrastructure investment future priority: ADB,"YOKOHAMA (Pajhwok): More investments in infrastructure is needed to support continued growth in Asia and the Pacific and combat climate change, Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Takehiko Nakao said on Saturday.",SheerAhmad,2017-05-06,,"YOKOHAMA (Pajhwok): More investments in infrastructure is needed to support continued growth in Asia and the Pacific and combat climate change, Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Takehiko Nakao said on Saturday. At the ADB Board of Governors’ meeting, he said investment in infrastructure would remain a priority for the Manila-based bank, which had prepared a new long-term strategy to respond to rapid regional changes. ADB’s annual meeting brings together about 6,000 government officials, academics, business officers, civil society representatives and members of the media. Held in Yokohama, under the theme “Building Together the Prosperity of Asia,” the annual meeting is also a celebration of ADB’s 50 years of development work in Asia and the Pacific. Nakao said ADB’s achievements over the past half century could be summarised as combining knowledge and finance, promoting good policies and fostering regional cooperation. He said that ADB’s future direction would be led by Strategy 2030, a new long-term strategy that would map the best ways for the bank to support Asia’s growth and address development challenges. The challenges include poverty, climate change, urbansation, aging and widening inequalities. ADB continues to hold consultations on the strategy with a wide range of stakeholders from around the region and in donor countries. Investment in infrastructure would be an ADB priority under Strategy 2030, including enhanced support for projects that incorporate advanced technologies. “Asia will need $1.7 trillion per year in investments in power, transport, telecommunications and water through 2030,” Nakao estimated. Support for social sectors, especially health and education , is a second ADB priority area. For this, Nakao stated, ADB would support universal healthcare systems and cross-border initiatives to combat communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. The strategy will also prioritise support for gender equality, a cross-cutting issue that influences all aspects of society and economic development. Nakao promised ADB would design projects that helped women and girls secure higher skills, better health, more jobs and a larger voice in decision-making. ADB would upgrade efforts to mobilize private resources for development, including through public-private partnerships under the new long-term strategy. “ADB is supporting an increasing number of private sector projects in education, health, and agriculture ,” Nakao said, adding: “Funding micro, small and medium-sized enterprises through local banks would remain a priority.” Nakao stressed the need for continued reform of ADB, such as strengthening its sector and thematic expertise, enhancing staff capacity and streamline procedures. The institution will deepen collaboration with civil society, academia, the private sector and local governments. He highlighted ADB’s progress in 2016. He noted total ADB operations last year, including co-financing and technical assistance, reached $31.7 billion. Its loan and grant approvals reached a record high of $17.5 billion, a 9% increase from the previous year. Climate finance reached $3.7 billion, up from $2.6 billion in 2015. Co-financing with public and private partners increased to $13.9 billion.

US concerned at widespread torture of Afghan detainees,WASHINGTON (Pajhwok): The United States has identified widespread torture and abuse of detainees by government forces as ‘most significant’ human rights problems in Afghanistan,Ali,2017-03-05,,"WASHINGTON (Pajhwok): The United States has identified widespread torture and abuse of detainees by government forces as ‘most significant’ human rights problems in Afghanistan . The State Department in its annual human rights report said the most significant human rights problems in Afghanistan included torture and abuse of detainees by government forces. Other volitions included widespread disregard for the rule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses, and targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls. The report also covered violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians by armed insurgent groups, armed insurgent groups’ killings of persons affiliated with the government; The State Department said widespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those who committed human rights abuses were serious problems. The government did not consistently or effectively prosecute abuses by officials, including security forces, it said. The Taliban and other insurgents continued to kill security force personnel and civilians, including journalists, using indiscriminate tactics such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), car bombs, suicide attacks, rocket attacks, and armed attacks. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) attributed 61 percent of civilian casualties (1,569 deaths and 3,574 injured) to non-state actors. “The Taliban used children as suicide bombers, soldiers, and weapons carriers. Other antigovernment elements threatened, robbed, kidnapped, and attacked villagers, foreigners, civil servants, and medical and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers. Authorities did not effectively investigate or prosecute most of these abuses,” it said. Other human rights problems included extrajudicial killings by security forces; ineffective government investigations of abuse and torture by local security forces; poor prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of women accused of so-called moral crimes; and prolonged pretrial detentions; the State Department said. Judicial corruption and ineffectiveness; violations of privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of speech, press, religion, and movement; pervasive governmental corruption; underage and forced marriages; abuse of children, including sexual abuse; were other major human rights problems in the country, it said. Trafficking in persons, including forced labor; discrimination against persons with disabilities; discrimination and abuses against ethnic minorities; societal discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and HIV/AIDS status; and abuse of workers’ rights, including child labor, were some other human rights issues in Afghanistan, the State Department said. lkj/ma",{},"['state', 'widespread', 'forces', 'including', 'abuse', 'concerned', 'discrimination', 'security', 'human', 'detainees', 'torture', 'abuses', 'afghan', 'rights', 'problems']","WASHINGTON (Pajhwok): The United States has identified widespread torture and abuse of detainees by government forces as ‘most significant’ human rights problems in Afghanistan .

The Missing Men in Violence against Women,"Maria Correia Before we can end violence against women, we must first ask the fundamental question of what is going on with men – the main perpetrators of this violence – and why are societies worldwide producing so many violent men?",javed.hamim,2013-11-25,,"Maria Correia Before we can end violence against women , we must first ask the fundamental question of what is going on with men – the main perpetrators of this violence – and why are societies worldwide producing so many violent men? As we today mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, this calamity has reached epidemic proportions. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization released the first systematic study of global data on the prevalence of violence against women. This ground breaking work revealed that fully one third of women worldwide – nearly one billion women – will experience physical violence from a male partner in their lifetimes. In response, the report recommends a range of actions, including care for victims, education , empowerment, mandatory reporting – all of which, while important, are not new. Women’s groups have been advocating for and implementing such programs for decades. But the problem has persisted or even increased in rich and poor countries alike – across age groups, classes, cultures and races. The time has come to shift our thinking and approach. We need to turn our attention to the behavior and motivations of the men and ask a different set of questions. What is going on with the men who are committing these violent acts? Why do so many men abuse women and girls – particularly their own family members? Why is men’s violence against women such common place across countries in the world today? And how do institutions in our society perpetuate the practice of men abusing and violating women? Violence against women is closely linked to the rigid norms that define what it is to be a man. Worldwide there is a dominant model of manhood; men are taught to aspire to and judge themselves based on this ideal. Men are expected to be financially independent, become husbands and fathers, be the primary income earner for the family, be achievers in the eyes of peers, and be in control and exert authority. These salient norms of manhood are perpetuated by societies, communities, peers, families and women themselves – and take on more extreme forms in some cultures. But for most men, particularly poor men, there is a huge gap between these expectations and what they can achieve. In the face of chronic poverty, inequality, exclusion, jobless economies, many men feel they don’t measure up. How then, do these men prove themselves as men? All too often it is through the use of force and violence – and female partners are easy targets. Such behavior is often the only way for many men to wield power in societies where they are made to feel powerless and useless. This is the hard reality that remains unacknowledged or misunderstood in much of the discussion on gender violence today. In a household survey of 1,552 men in India, one third of men said they were ashamed to face their family because they were jobless or did not earn enough income. Those unemployed men who reported being stressed or ashamed were 50 percent more likely to use violence against a partner and twice as likely to have used sexual violence than men who did not report economic stress. So what do we do? Ultimately, societies must challenge the impossible-to-achieve demands of manhood and the patriarchal structures that underpin these demands. We need to redefine notions of manhood and find alternative masculine identities that are not destructive to women and men alike. This is a long-term prospect but it starts by changing the way we – both women and men – raise boys to be men. In practical terms, we need to integrate men fully in programming efforts. Targeting men in sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, fatherhood and HIV/AIDS programs, for example, has shown to bring positive changes in men‘s attitudes and behaviors. The good news is that such programs are springing up across South Asia and elsewhere and showing results. We also urgently need to better understand male motivations for violence. While data are limited, the IMAGES and Partners for Prevention surveys, which include the India survey noted earlier and Sri Lanka, offer the most comprehensive analyses to date on men’s attitudes and practices on gender violence. Such data should be used to tailor prevention strategies. As we reflect today, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and as we near the first anniversary of the horrific Delhi gang rape and murder of a female student, we need to work differently and more creatively to end this egregious and pervasive form of violence. This means addressing men’s gender issues to prevent violence before it happens, and making men a central part of the solution.

Trafficking in Persons of irregular migrants in Afghanistan,"KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male",daud.hussaini,2017-06-08,,"KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male drug addicts under a bridge in Kabul, has accused her husband and in-laws of pushing her into drug addiction. In a state of discomfort, the woman alleged that her in-laws deceitfully gave her opium to relieve the pain that resulted from the injuries she suffered in a traffic accident. Gradually, she became dependent on the drug. According to recent media reports, two to four addicts die in Pul-i-Sukhta area daily in the freezing Kabul winter. Hailing from the Irans north-western Qazvin province, Laila Qambari said her mother was Dari-speaking and her father hailed from the Turkic Qazvin tribe. After passing 12th standard with very good grades, she got admission in the Imam Khomeini University, where she studied medical science for three and a half years. Also, at the age of 11, she stood first among 400 participants in a Quran recitation competition. She has also received a certificate from an Iranian computer academy. Physical condition Qambari lives in an extremely dirty surrounding and the stench emanating from the filth all around makes almost impossible to breathe without wearing a mask. Resigned to fate and compelled to live in such extreme conditions, the 30-year-old but seemingly 50-plus is suffering from hearing impairment. She came out of the bridge, looking pale, frail and malnourished, with no teeth in her lower jaw. She leaned against the wall and agreed for an interview with Pajhwok Afghan News scribe. Qambari married a young Afghan from central Daikundi province some 12-year ago. After two years of marriage she decided to come to Afghanistan to meet her in-laws. On her arrival in Daikundi, a foreign health NGO offered her a job, which she joined with her in-laws permission. Unable to speak with ease with her hands shivering because of weakness, Qambari said she worked as deputy district field coordinator (DDFC) with UNAMA in 2010, as trainer for midwives with MPO and in charge of a 50-bed hospital run by a French organization. “I am too tired to remember how many other offices I have worked for,” said Qambari, with fatigue writ large on her face. Reminiscing the lost bright past, her voice choked and tears rolling down her eyes, she broke down. Involuntary addiction through deceit After half an hour of silence, she started sharing her journey into deep dark valley of addiction. The woman recalled she was suffered a spinal cord injury in a traffic accident five years ago in Shahristan district. She recalled her mother-in-law giving her a cup of tea with two small black pills in it saying that it is a medicine that will soothe the pain and cure the spinal cord injury that she suffered in a traffic accident in Afghanistan. Unaware of the fact that it was not medicine but raw opium that she was given as a cure. Qambari was annoyed with her in-laws and husband, saying they did not take her to a physician for treatment and instead gave her opium for six months. Meanwhile, during that period, she also got pregnant and was brought to Kabul for medical checkup. After her examination, the doctor found her irresponsive to anesthesia and found her consuming opium for six months. Subsequently, Qambari lost her baby to a higher anesthesia dose and excessive use of medicine. “I spent my entire life receiving religious education , strived to become a doctor and it pains me a lot to realize that I am a drug addict now.” Qambari was angry with her in-laws and husband for making her an addict. She said that “My husband was a drug addict in the past and had been using opium openly at home.” Following her discharge from the hospital and no care at home, she came to know that her husband was arrested by police in Wasilabad area for drug peddling and subsequently sentenced to two years in jail. In the absence of her husband and support from her in-laws, she was forced to live on streets and finally finding her way to the ghetto called Pul-i-Sukhta, west of Kabul amidst hordes of addicts taking drugs and living in the most depraved conditions. Kabul health officials have relocated a number of addicts to secure areas. But there are still hundreds of women and men addicts living under the bridge. Many of whom are faced with a looming death. Asked why she did not ask her family in Iran for help, she replied: “I won’t go to Iran to earn a bad name for my parents. I expected help from my in-laws but they too forsake me.” Asked if she ever intended to quit addiction, Qambari replied: “Once I was admitted to a rehabilitation centre, however, after being discharged and without any support system available to me, I once again found my way amongst other addicts under Pul-i-Sukhta where I am subject to constant harassment.” Lamenting her bright past and current grim realities, she sighed: “Earlier I would treat thousands of people; I had a salary of $7,000 and paid for marriages of my husband’s brothers. But now there is no one coming to my rescue. I am all alone in this hour of anguish.” Laila, who was an educated and a successful woman with a bright future is now a recluse and forced to live a doomed life under Pul-e Sukhta, is made an involuntary drug addict by her husband through deceit. Laila, who once soared up in the limitless skies, is now a fallen sparrow with bruised wings deep under Pul-e Sukhta. Despite placed in grim present, she did indicate her zeal for a better future by saying that “I want the government to decide my husband’s case and send me to a rehabilitation centre for cure. As I am an educated woman, I could be employed as a nurse or a computer instructor in Afghanistan.” Iranian embassy: We will facilitate her honourable return to Iran A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Kabul said that if Qambari proved her Iranian citizenship and desired to return to her home country, we would facilitate her treatment and honourable return. He said the embassy had informed all Iranians living in Afghanistan to contact the diplomatic missions for resolving their problems and provide help. Ministry of Counter-Narcotics: 3.5 million drug addicts According to the Ministry of Counter-Narcotics, currently 3.5 million people are addicted to drugs, including 2.9 percent women addicts. The Ministry of Counter-Narcotics said Qambari might be one of the addicted women who were not present in the area during a campaign for rehabilitating such individuals living on Kabuls streets. Mohammad Hanif Danishyar, the ministry’s spokesman, said nearly 116 rehabilitation centres existed all over the country, which had the capacity to take care of more than 40,000 addicts -- 30 percent of women and children. In addition, a 150-bed rehabilitation centre has been established to treat addicted women and children, apprehended from streets. He expressed concern over the relapse of rehabilitated people into addiction, citing their non-acceptance by relatives, unemployment, poverty and a low level of awareness as main reasons. However, he said, the ministry concerned was trying to promote awareness among the people through mosques and schools about the need for the rehabilitation of drug-dependent individuals. Local NGOs: Family support vital in rehabilitation Nejat Centre, a local NGO operating over past 26 years to treat addicts, providing vocational training to addicts and their families and spreading awareness about connect between drugs and AIDS. Head of Nejat Centre, Qasim Zamani, noted that the drug addicts situation worsens during winters, saying that ""there have been increased number of deaths of women drug addicts living in the Pul-i-Sukhta vicinity due to severe cold while many more are facing an impending death."" He said NGOs and government facilities were treating only 3-5 percent of addicts and the rest remain deprived of rehabilitation services. He noted that public and family support was vital in dealing with this menace. In the absence of their support, he said, no programme would yield positive results. The families, rejecting rehabilitated women, are regularly contacted by Nejat. The women who are not accepted by their families are referred to certain organisations, which facilitate them in gaining employment. Addiction deadlier than venomous snake - AIHRC The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) dubbed addiction as a poisonous snake, saying a discernible rise is evidenced in the number of women drug addicts. The female addicts may face sexual assaults, violence and contract HIV. Suraya Subhrang, an AIHRC member, termed the current situation of addicts as worrying, saying that they are deprived of basic human rights. The government should pay heed to their plight and prevent the menace. She expressed concern over the lack of rehabilitation facilities in the country. “At provincial rehab centres, there are no wards specified for women addicts. They are crowded into a room with male addicts.” Critical of lack of focused strategy on the part of government towards post-rehabilitation support to individuals, She noted that ""lack of post rehabilitation support drives the cured individuals to fall prey to their drug habits again"". Subhrang said she had suggested the government of strategies for eradicating the scourge but, unfortunately, the authorities had so far taken no serious step in this regard. Afghanistans Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons considers abuse of vulnerability or need of a person through deceit a case of Human trafficking which is a punishable offence as per provisions of this law as well as under Afghanistan penal code. The drug issue and the increasing number of addicts are considered a huge challenge, just like terrorism.

يوه روږدې ايرانۍ مېرمنه د کابل تر پول سوخته لاندې ژوند کوي,"KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male",daud.hussaini,2017-01-28,,"KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male drug addicts under a bridge in Kabul, has accused her husband and in-laws of pushing her into drug addiction. In a state of discomfort, the woman alleged that her in-laws deceitfully gave her opium to relieve the pain that resulted from the injuries she suffered in a traffic accident. Gradually, she became dependent on the drug. According to recent media reports, two to four addicts die in Pul-i-Sukhta area daily in the freezing Kabul winter. Hailing from the Irans north-western Qazvin province, Laila Qambari said her mother was Dari-speaking and her father hailed from the Turkic Qazvin tribe. After passing 12th standard with very good grades, she got admission in the Imam Khomeini University, where she studied medical science for three and a half years. Also, at the age of 11, she stood first among 400 participants in a Quran recitation competition. She has also received a certificate from an Iranian computer academy. Physical condition Qambari lives in an extremely dirty surrounding and the stench emanating from the filth all around makes almost impossible to breathe without wearing a mask. Resigned to fate and compelled to live in such extreme conditions, the 30-year-old but seemingly 50-plus is suffering from hearing impairment. She came out of the bridge, looking pale, frail and malnourished, with no teeth in her lower jaw. She leaned against the wall and agreed for an interview with Pajhwok Afghan News scribe. Qambari married a young Afghan from central Daikundi province some 12-year ago. After two years of marriage she decided to come to Afghanistan to meet her in-laws. On her arrival in Daikundi, a foreign health NGO offered her a job, which she joined with her in-laws permission. Unable to speak with ease with her hands shivering because of weakness, Qambari said she worked as deputy district field coordinator (DDFC) with UNAMA in 2010, as trainer for midwives with MPO and in charge of a 50-bed hospital run by a French organization. “I am too tired to remember how many other offices I have worked for,” said Qambari, with fatigue writ large on her face. Reminiscing the lost bright past, her voice choked and tears rolling down her eyes, she broke down. Involuntary addiction through deceit After half an hour of silence, she started sharing her journey into deep dark valley of addiction. The woman recalled she was suffered a spinal cord injury in a traffic accident five years ago in Shahristan district. She recalled her mother-in-law giving her a cup of tea with two small black pills in it saying that it is a medicine that will soothe the pain and cure the spinal cord injury that she suffered in a traffic accident in Afghanistan. Unaware of the fact that it was not medicine but raw opium that she was given as a cure. Qambari was annoyed with her in-laws and husband, saying they did not take her to a physician for treatment and instead gave her opium for six months. Meanwhile, during that period, she also got pregnant and was brought to Kabul for medical checkup. After her examination, the doctor found her irresponsive to anesthesia and found her consuming opium for six months. Subsequently, Qambari lost her baby to a higher anesthesia dose and excessive use of medicine. “I spent my entire life receiving religious education , strived to become a doctor and it pains me a lot to realize that I am a drug addict now.” Qambari was angry with her in-laws and husband for making her an addict. She said that “My husband was a drug addict in the past and had been using opium openly at home.” Following her discharge from the hospital and no care at home, she came to know that her husband was arrested by police in Wasilabad area for drug peddling and subsequently sentenced to two years in jail. In the absence of her husband and support from her in-laws, she was forced to live on streets and finally finding her way to the ghetto called Pul-i-Sukhta, west of Kabul amidst hordes of addicts taking drugs and living in the most depraved conditions. Kabul health officials have relocated a number of addicts to secure areas. But there are still hundreds of women and men addicts living under the bridge. Many of whom are faced with a looming death. Asked why she did not ask her family in Iran for help, she replied: “I won’t go to Iran to earn a bad name for my parents. I expected help from my in-laws but they too forsake me.” Asked if she ever intended to quit addiction, Qambari replied: “Once I was admitted to a rehabilitation centre, however, after being discharged and without any support system available to me, I once again found my way amongst other addicts under Pul-i-Sukhta where I am subject to constant harassment.” Lamenting her bright past and current grim realities, she sighed: “Earlier I would treat thousands of people; I had a salary of $7,000 and paid for marriages of my husband’s brothers. But now there is no one coming to my rescue. I am all alone in this hour of anguish.” Laila, who was an educated and a successful woman with a bright future is now a recluse and forced to live a doomed life under Pul-e Sukhta, is made an involuntary drug addict by her husband through deceit. Laila, who once soared up in the limitless skies, is now a fallen sparrow with bruised wings deep under Pul-e Sukhta. Despite placed in grim present, she did indicate her zeal for a better future by saying that “I want the government to decide my husband’s case and send me to a rehabilitation centre for cure. As I am an educated woman, I could be employed as a nurse or a computer instructor in Afghanistan.” Iranian embassy: We will facilitate her honourable return to Iran A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Kabul said that if Qambari proved her Iranian citizenship and desired to return to her home country, we would facilitate her treatment and honourable return. He said the embassy had informed all Iranians living in Afghanistan to contact the diplomatic missions for resolving their problems and provide help. Ministry of Counter-Narcotics: 3.5 million drug addicts According to the Ministry of Counter-Narcotics, currently 3.5 million people are addicted to drugs, including 2.9 percent women addicts. The Ministry of Counter-Narcotics said Qambari might be one of the addicted women who were not present in the area during a campaign for rehabilitating such individuals living on Kabuls streets. Mohammad Hanif Danishyar, the ministry’s spokesman, said nearly 116 rehabilitation centres existed all over the country, which had the capacity to take care of more than 40,000 addicts -- 30 percent of women and children. In addition, a 150-bed rehabilitation centre has been established to treat addicted women and children, apprehended from streets. He expressed concern over the relapse of rehabilitated people into addiction, citing their non-acceptance by relatives, unemployment, poverty and a low level of awareness as main reasons. However, he said, the ministry concerned was trying to promote awareness among the people through mosques and schools about the need for the rehabilitation of drug-dependent individuals. Local NGOs: Family support vital in rehabilitation Nejat Centre, a local NGO operating over past 26 years to treat addicts, providing vocational training to addicts and their families and spreading awareness about connect between drugs and AIDS. Head of Nejat Centre, Qasim Zamani, noted that the drug addicts situation worsens during winters, saying that ""there have been increased number of deaths of women drug addicts living in the Pul-i-Sukhta vicinity due to severe cold while many more are facing an impending death."" He said NGOs and government facilities were treating only 3-5 percent of addicts and the rest remain deprived of rehabilitation services. He noted that public and family support was vital in dealing with this menace. In the absence of their support, he said, no programme would yield positive results. The families, rejecting rehabilitated women, are regularly contacted by Nejat. The women who are not accepted by their families are referred to certain organisations, which facilitate them in gaining employment. Addiction deadlier than venomous snake - AIHRC The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) dubbed addiction as a poisonous snake, saying a discernible rise is evidenced in the number of women drug addicts. The female addicts may face sexual assaults, violence and contract HIV. Suraya Subhrang, an AIHRC member, termed the current situation of addicts as worrying, saying that they are deprived of basic human rights. The government should pay heed to their plight and prevent the menace. She expressed concern over the lack of rehabilitation facilities in the country. “At provincial rehab centres, there are no wards specified for women addicts. They are crowded into a room with male addicts.” Critical of lack of focused strategy on the part of government towards post-rehabilitation support to individuals, She noted that ""lack of post rehabilitation support drives the cured individuals to fall prey to their drug habits again"". Subhrang said she had suggested the government of strategies for eradicating the scourge but, unfortunately, the authorities had so far taken no serious step in this regard. Afghanistans Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons considers abuse of vulnerability or need of a person through deceit a case of Human trafficking which is a punishable offence as per provisions of this law as well as under Afghanistan penal code. The drug issue and the increasing number of addicts are considered a huge challenge, just like terrorism.

The State Department in its annual human rights report said the most significant human rights problems in Afghanistan included torture and abuse of detainees by government forces. Other volitions included widespread disregard for the rule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses, and targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls. The report also covered violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians by armed insurgent groups, armed insurgent groups’ killings of persons affiliated with the government; The State Department said widespread disregard for the rule of law and official impunity for those who committed human rights abuses were serious problems. The government did not consistently or effectively prosecute abuses by officials, including security forces, it said. The Taliban and other insurgents continued to kill security force personnel and civilians, including journalists, using indiscriminate tactics such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), car bombs, suicide attacks, rocket attacks, and armed attacks. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) attributed 61 percent of civilian casualties (1,569 deaths and 3,574 injured) to non-state actors. “The Taliban used children as suicide bombers, soldiers, and weapons carriers. Other antigovernment elements threatened, robbed, kidnapped, and attacked villagers, foreigners, civil servants, and medical and nongovernmental organization (NGO) workers. Authorities did not effectively investigate or prosecute most of these abuses,” it said. Other human rights problems included extrajudicial killings by security forces; ineffective government investigations of abuse and torture by local security forces; poor prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of women accused of so-called moral crimes; and prolonged pretrial detentions; the State Department said. Judicial corruption and ineffectiveness; violations of privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of speech, press, religion, and movement; pervasive governmental corruption; underage and forced marriages; abuse of children, including sexual abuse; were other major human rights problems in the country, it said. Trafficking in persons, including forced labor; discrimination against persons with disabilities; discrimination and abuses against ethnic minorities; societal discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and HIV/AIDS status; and abuse of workers’ rights, including child labor, were some other human rights issues in Afghanistan, the State Department said. lkj/ma",{},"['state', 'widespread', 'forces', 'including', 'abuse', 'concerned', 'discrimination', 'security', 'human', 'detainees', 'torture', 'abuses', 'afghan', 'rights', 'problems']","WASHINGTON (Pajhwok): The United States has identified widespread torture and abuse of detainees by government forces as ‘most significant’ human rights problems in Afghanistan .

The Missing Men in Violence against Women,"Maria Correia Before we can end violence against women, we must first ask the fundamental question of what is going on with men – the main perpetrators of this violence – and why are societies worldwide producing so many violent men?",javed.hamim,2013-11-25,,"Maria Correia Before we can end violence against women , we must first ask the fundamental question of what is going on with men – the main perpetrators of this violence – and why are societies worldwide producing so many violent men? As we today mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, this calamity has reached epidemic proportions. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization released the first systematic study of global data on the prevalence of violence against women. This ground breaking work revealed that fully one third of women worldwide – nearly one billion women – will experience physical violence from a male partner in their lifetimes. In response, the report recommends a range of actions, including care for victims, education , empowerment, mandatory reporting – all of which, while important, are not new. Women’s groups have been advocating for and implementing such programs for decades. But the problem has persisted or even increased in rich and poor countries alike – across age groups, classes, cultures and races. The time has come to shift our thinking and approach. We need to turn our attention to the behavior and motivations of the men and ask a different set of questions. What is going on with the men who are committing these violent acts? Why do so many men abuse women and girls – particularly their own family members? Why is men’s violence against women such common place across countries in the world today? And how do institutions in our society perpetuate the practice of men abusing and violating women? Violence against women is closely linked to the rigid norms that define what it is to be a man. Worldwide there is a dominant model of manhood; men are taught to aspire to and judge themselves based on this ideal. Men are expected to be financially independent, become husbands and fathers, be the primary income earner for the family, be achievers in the eyes of peers, and be in control and exert authority. These salient norms of manhood are perpetuated by societies, communities, peers, families and women themselves – and take on more extreme forms in some cultures. But for most men, particularly poor men, there is a huge gap between these expectations and what they can achieve. In the face of chronic poverty, inequality, exclusion, jobless economies, many men feel they don’t measure up. How then, do these men prove themselves as men? All too often it is through the use of force and violence – and female partners are easy targets. Such behavior is often the only way for many men to wield power in societies where they are made to feel powerless and useless. This is the hard reality that remains unacknowledged or misunderstood in much of the discussion on gender violence today. In a household survey of 1,552 men in India, one third of men said they were ashamed to face their family because they were jobless or did not earn enough income. Those unemployed men who reported being stressed or ashamed were 50 percent more likely to use violence against a partner and twice as likely to have used sexual violence than men who did not report economic stress. So what do we do? Ultimately, societies must challenge the impossible-to-achieve demands of manhood and the patriarchal structures that underpin these demands. We need to redefine notions of manhood and find alternative masculine identities that are not destructive to women and men alike. This is a long-term prospect but it starts by changing the way we – both women and men – raise boys to be men. In practical terms, we need to integrate men fully in programming efforts. Targeting men in sexual and reproductive health, maternal and child health, fatherhood and HIV/AIDS programs, for example, has shown to bring positive changes in men‘s attitudes and behaviors. The good news is that such programs are springing up across South Asia and elsewhere and showing results. We also urgently need to better understand male motivations for violence. While data are limited, the IMAGES and Partners for Prevention surveys, which include the India survey noted earlier and Sri Lanka, offer the most comprehensive analyses to date on men’s attitudes and practices on gender violence. Such data should be used to tailor prevention strategies. As we reflect today, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and as we near the first anniversary of the horrific Delhi gang rape and murder of a female student, we need to work differently and more creatively to end this egregious and pervasive form of violence. This means addressing men’s gender issues to prevent violence before it happens, and making men a central part of the solution.

Trafficking in Persons of irregular migrants in Afghanistan,"KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male",daud.hussaini,2017-06-08,,"KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male drug addicts under a bridge in Kabul, has accused her husband and in-laws of pushing her into drug addiction. In a state of discomfort, the woman alleged that her in-laws deceitfully gave her opium to relieve the pain that resulted from the injuries she suffered in a traffic accident. Gradually, she became dependent on the drug. According to recent media reports, two to four addicts die in Pul-i-Sukhta area daily in the freezing Kabul winter. Hailing from the Irans north-western Qazvin province, Laila Qambari said her mother was Dari-speaking and her father hailed from the Turkic Qazvin tribe. After passing 12th standard with very good grades, she got admission in the Imam Khomeini University, where she studied medical science for three and a half years. Also, at the age of 11, she stood first among 400 participants in a Quran recitation competition. She has also received a certificate from an Iranian computer academy. Physical condition Qambari lives in an extremely dirty surrounding and the stench emanating from the filth all around makes almost impossible to breathe without wearing a mask. Resigned to fate and compelled to live in such extreme conditions, the 30-year-old but seemingly 50-plus is suffering from hearing impairment. She came out of the bridge, looking pale, frail and malnourished, with no teeth in her lower jaw. She leaned against the wall and agreed for an interview with Pajhwok Afghan News scribe. Qambari married a young Afghan from central Daikundi province some 12-year ago. After two years of marriage she decided to come to Afghanistan to meet her in-laws. On her arrival in Daikundi, a foreign health NGO offered her a job, which she joined with her in-laws permission. Unable to speak with ease with her hands shivering because of weakness, Qambari said she worked as deputy district field coordinator (DDFC) with UNAMA in 2010, as trainer for midwives with MPO and in charge of a 50-bed hospital run by a French organization. “I am too tired to remember how many other offices I have worked for,” said Qambari, with fatigue writ large on her face. Reminiscing the lost bright past, her voice choked and tears rolling down her eyes, she broke down. Involuntary addiction through deceit After half an hour of silence, she started sharing her journey into deep dark valley of addiction. The woman recalled she was suffered a spinal cord injury in a traffic accident five years ago in Shahristan district. She recalled her mother-in-law giving her a cup of tea with two small black pills in it saying that it is a medicine that will soothe the pain and cure the spinal cord injury that she suffered in a traffic accident in Afghanistan. Unaware of the fact that it was not medicine but raw opium that she was given as a cure. Qambari was annoyed with her in-laws and husband, saying they did not take her to a physician for treatment and instead gave her opium for six months. Meanwhile, during that period, she also got pregnant and was brought to Kabul for medical checkup. After her examination, the doctor found her irresponsive to anesthesia and found her consuming opium for six months. Subsequently, Qambari lost her baby to a higher anesthesia dose and excessive use of medicine. “I spent my entire life receiving religious education , strived to become a doctor and it pains me a lot to realize that I am a drug addict now.” Qambari was angry with her in-laws and husband for making her an addict. She said that “My husband was a drug addict in the past and had been using opium openly at home.” Following her discharge from the hospital and no care at home, she came to know that her husband was arrested by police in Wasilabad area for drug peddling and subsequently sentenced to two years in jail. In the absence of her husband and support from her in-laws, she was forced to live on streets and finally finding her way to the ghetto called Pul-i-Sukhta, west of Kabul amidst hordes of addicts taking drugs and living in the most depraved conditions. Kabul health officials have relocated a number of addicts to secure areas. But there are still hundreds of women and men addicts living under the bridge. Many of whom are faced with a looming death. Asked why she did not ask her family in Iran for help, she replied: “I won’t go to Iran to earn a bad name for my parents. I expected help from my in-laws but they too forsake me.” Asked if she ever intended to quit addiction, Qambari replied: “Once I was admitted to a rehabilitation centre, however, after being discharged and without any support system available to me, I once again found my way amongst other addicts under Pul-i-Sukhta where I am subject to constant harassment.” Lamenting her bright past and current grim realities, she sighed: “Earlier I would treat thousands of people; I had a salary of $7,000 and paid for marriages of my husband’s brothers. But now there is no one coming to my rescue. I am all alone in this hour of anguish.” Laila, who was an educated and a successful woman with a bright future is now a recluse and forced to live a doomed life under Pul-e Sukhta, is made an involuntary drug addict by her husband through deceit. Laila, who once soared up in the limitless skies, is now a fallen sparrow with bruised wings deep under Pul-e Sukhta. Despite placed in grim present, she did indicate her zeal for a better future by saying that “I want the government to decide my husband’s case and send me to a rehabilitation centre for cure. As I am an educated woman, I could be employed as a nurse or a computer instructor in Afghanistan.” Iranian embassy: We will facilitate her honourable return to Iran A spokesman for the Iranian embassy in Kabul said that if Qambari proved her Iranian citizenship and desired to return to her home country, we would facilitate her treatment and honourable return. He said the embassy had informed all Iranians living in Afghanistan to contact the diplomatic missions for resolving their problems and provide help. Ministry of Counter-Narcotics: 3.5 million drug addicts According to the Ministry of Counter-Narcotics, currently 3.5 million people are addicted to drugs, including 2.9 percent women addicts. The Ministry of Counter-Narcotics said Qambari might be one of the addicted women who were not present in the area during a campaign for rehabilitating such individuals living on Kabuls streets. Mohammad Hanif Danishyar, the ministry’s spokesman, said nearly 116 rehabilitation centres existed all over the country, which had the capacity to take care of more than 40,000 addicts -- 30 percent of women and children. In addition, a 150-bed rehabilitation centre has been established to treat addicted women and children, apprehended from streets. He expressed concern over the relapse of rehabilitated people into addiction, citing their non-acceptance by relatives, unemployment, poverty and a low level of awareness as main reasons. However, he said, the ministry concerned was trying to promote awareness among the people through mosques and schools about the need for the rehabilitation of drug-dependent individuals. Local NGOs: Family support vital in rehabilitation Nejat Centre, a local NGO operating over past 26 years to treat addicts, providing vocational training to addicts and their families and spreading awareness about connect between drugs and AIDS. Head of Nejat Centre, Qasim Zamani, noted that the drug addicts situation worsens during winters, saying that ""there have been increased number of deaths of women drug addicts living in the Pul-i-Sukhta vicinity due to severe cold while many more are facing an impending death."" He said NGOs and government facilities were treating only 3-5 percent of addicts and the rest remain deprived of rehabilitation services. He noted that public and family support was vital in dealing with this menace. In the absence of their support, he said, no programme would yield positive results. The families, rejecting rehabilitated women, are regularly contacted by Nejat. The women who are not accepted by their families are referred to certain organisations, which facilitate them in gaining employment. Addiction deadlier than venomous snake - AIHRC The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) dubbed addiction as a poisonous snake, saying a discernible rise is evidenced in the number of women drug addicts. The female addicts may face sexual assaults, violence and contract HIV. Suraya Subhrang, an AIHRC member, termed the current situation of addicts as worrying, saying that they are deprived of basic human rights. The government should pay heed to their plight and prevent the menace. She expressed concern over the lack of rehabilitation facilities in the country. “At provincial rehab centres, there are no wards specified for women addicts. They are crowded into a room with male addicts.” Critical of lack of focused strategy on the part of government towards post-rehabilitation support to individuals, She noted that ""lack of post rehabilitation support drives the cured individuals to fall prey to their drug habits again"". Subhrang said she had suggested the government of strategies for eradicating the scourge but, unfortunately, the authorities had so far taken no serious step in this regard. Afghanistans Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons considers abuse of vulnerability or need of a person through deceit a case of Human trafficking which is a punishable offence as per provisions of this law as well as under Afghanistan penal code. The drug issue and the increasing number of addicts are considered a huge challenge, just like terrorism. There is also an international dimension to the problem, which should also be dealt with internationally. nh/sns/mud",{},"['saying', 'qambari', 'trafficking', 'living', 'rehabilitation', 'women', 'afghanistan', 'drug', 'irregular', 'migrants', 'addicts', 'support', 'inlaws', 'persons', 'husband']","KABUL (Pajhwok): An Iranian woman, currently living alongside male drug addicts under a bridge in Kabul, has accused her husband and in-laws of pushing her into drug addiction.
