Indonesia at Risk of Losing Global HIV Support,,Nusa Dua.,2018-10-13,Jakarta Globe,"Hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV in lower-middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, risk losing critical support when global charities pull funding from countries graduating to a higher income tier, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation said at a press conference on the sidelines of the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Thursday. (JG Photo/Sheany) Nusa Dua. Hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV in lower-middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, risk losing critical support when global charities pull funding from countries graduating to a higher income tier, a global nonprofit warned on Thursday. Income level, determined by the World Bank based solely on a countrys per-capita gross national income, has become the main reference for aid allocation used by many charities focused on HIV support. Countries often graduate to the upper-middle-income tier without a corresponding equal income distribution, nor robust health care systems in place. This is soon followed by charities shifting their focus from such countries, leaving many people living with HIV in those places without adequate support, as these countries do not yet provide affordable health care services of their own. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), a Los Angeles-based global nonprofit provider of HIV prevention services to more than a million people in 41 countries, has been advocating for raising the upper-middle-income threshold by three to five times the current standard, and including other metrics, such a countrys disease burden, income gap and quality of life. ""We dont want the World Bank to use the arbitrary calculation anymore; we want a more cohesive consideration of all the factors in the country,"" Marie Ko, advocacy and marketing manager at AHF Asia, said on the sidelines of 2018 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group in Nusa Dua, Bali. Indonesia, which currently sits on the higher end of the World Banks lower-middle-income tier – a gross national income of between $996 and $3,895 per capita – is expected to soon graduate to the upper-middle-income tier. The United Nations AIDS prevention agency said in a statement that several donors have stated their intention to defund HIV programs in Indonesia once the country moves into the upper-middle-income tier. This would leave an estimated 630,000 Indonesians living with HIV at risk. Only 42 percent are believed to be aware of their HIV status and a meager 14 percent are receiving treatment for the disease. Even worse, foreign funding accounts for about 44 percent of the $100 million the country spends annually on treatment and prevention of the disease. ""We see this as a critical moment for Indonesia, once they lose the funding after becoming [an upper-middle-income country] they will have fewer resources to tackle the problems of HIV/AIDS,"" Ko said. Riki Febrian, AHF Indonesia country program manager, said a lack of awareness of HIV/AIDS and current cost of treatment is one of the factors preventing people from having themselves tested for the disease, or from seeking treatment. Despite ongoing government efforts to combat HIV and the national target of providing 81 percent of all people living with HIV with antiretroviral therapy by 2030, many programs led by civil society organizations to address the issue at the grassroots still heavily depend on external funding. ""We think its unjust to a certain extent, because [countries such as] Indonesia will lose funding from, for example, the Global Fund, so how can they sustain their programs and cope up with the gaps?"" Ko said, referring to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, an international financing organization that aims to attract, leverage and invest additional resources to end epidemics of these diseases around the world.",{},"['world', 'countries', 'hiv', 'uppermiddleincome', 'living', 'global', 'income', 'losing', 'funding', 'support', 'indonesia', 'risk', 'country']","Hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV in lower-middle-income countries, such as Indonesia, risk losing critical support when global charities pull funding from countries graduating to a higher income tier, a global nonprofit warned on Thursday.

HIV: Life expectancy and outlook,There is no set length of time that a person can live with HIV. Life expectancy increases as new treatments become available. People can now manage HIV as a chronic condition. Learn more here.,,,Medical News Today,"The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years. Thanks to advances in treatment, namely antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV can now expect to live long, healthy lives. When the HIV and AIDS epidemic began in the United States in the 1980s, HIV was a life-threatening condition. However, people can now manage it as a chronic health condition, much like they would diabetes or heart failure. In this article, we examine developments in managing and treating HIV, as well as the long-term outlook. Recent improvements Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. The increase in life expectancy for people living with HIV has direct links to improvements in medical therapy, which includes antiretroviral medications. These medications help suppress levels of HIV in the blood and slow damage resulting from the infection. This suppression helps prevent progression from HIV to AIDS, or stage 3 HIV. In the 1980s–1990s, antiretroviral therapy began as monotherapy, then it became dual therapy. Now, there is combination antiretroviral therapy, which includes using three or more drugs. There are several classes of antiretroviral drugs that attack HIV in different ways. Combinations of drugs are the first-line treatment. People typically start antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV. A 2017 study in the journal AIDS found that the additional life expectancy for people with HIV at age 20 during the early monotherapy era was 11.8 years. However, that number rose to 54.9 years for the most recent combination antiretroviral era. Researchers also concluded that people with HIV with higher education had a similar life expectancy to the general population. Future treatment options Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Researchers continue to work on a cure for HIV. In the meantime, combination antiretroviral therapy preserves the health of a person with HIV. It does this by suppressing the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. It is important for the person to follow their therapy plan precisely. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now report that when a person taking antiretroviral therapy has a negative viral load in their blood, the risk of transmitting the virus to a person without HIV is essentially zero. This discovery takes researchers to a notion of ""treatment as prevention,"" which promotes well-controlled HIV as a way to prevent transmission through sexual contact, needle sharing, and childbirth and breastfeeding. Because people with HIV are living much longer, they are starting to face the same health issues as other older adults. In fact, differentiating Alzheimers disease from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is becoming an emerging issue in the population of older adults living with HIV. Even with the advances in antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV may experience long-term side effects of either the therapy or HIV itself. Conditions common in long-standing HIV infection include: cardiovascular disease lung disease certain cancers HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders liver disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C HIV also appears to increase chronic inflammation in the body, putting a person at risk of certain health conditions. However, more research is necessary to better understand this. Antiretroviral medications have links to both short- and long-term side effects. Most side effects are manageable but can become serious. A person should speak with their healthcare provider about side effects that are of any concern. Long-term effects from antiretrovirals can include: kidney failure liver failure heart disease type 2 diabetes high blood cholesterol levels lipodystrophy, or changes in how the body stores fat osteoporosis neuropathy Outlook A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. Life expectancy for people living with HIV has seen great improvement in recent years. In fact, a person who currently has HIV can expect to add many years to their life once they start combination antiretroviral treatment. A 2017 study in the journal HIV Medicine indicates that a person with HIV living in a high-income country would add 43.3 years to their life expectancy if they receive a diagnosis at age 20. Without adequate treatment, however, HIV can quickly start to damage cells in the immune system. It is important for a person living with HIV to stick to their treatment plan to keep the virus suppressed in the blood. It is also essential for the person to work closely with their healthcare providers on a regular basis and maintain all other aspects of their health and well-being.",{},"['person', 'expectancy', 'outlook', 'health', 'hiv', 'living', 'life', 'treatment', 'effects', 'antiretroviral', 'therapy']","The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years.

HIV Transmission,,,,,"Some groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including the status of their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live. When you live in a community where many people have HIV infection, the chances of having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV are higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis atlas to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different US communities. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different populations. Gay and bisexual men have the largest number of new diagnoses in the United States. Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Also, transgender women who have sex with men are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, and injection drug users remain at significant risk for getting HIV. Risky behaviors, like having anal or vaginal sex without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV, and sharing needles or syringes play a big role in HIV transmission. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. If you don’t have HIV, being a receptive partner (or bottom) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for getting HIV. If you do have HIV, being the insertive partner (or top) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for transmitting HIV. But there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, and using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV. Learn more about these and other strategies to prevent HIV. For more information about the risk for different groups of people, see HIV in the United States and HIV by Geographical Distribution.

HIV/AIDS - Symptoms and causes,,,,Mayo Clinic,"Overview Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your bodys ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. Theres no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. Symptoms The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if youre not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today dont develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. Youll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldnt usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: Soaking night sweats Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible. Causes HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. How does HIV become AIDS? HIV destroys CD4 T cells — white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication. How HIV spreads To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways: By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.

By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies. How HIV doesnt spread You cant become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you cant catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isnt spread through the air, water or insect bites. Risk factors When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now its clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, youre at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. Use intravenous drugs. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other peoples blood. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other peoples blood. Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV. Complications HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Its a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Its a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus. This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.

This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite thats commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS. Cancers common to HIV/AIDS Kaposis sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposis sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.

"First in Asia, Thailand Eliminates Mother-To-Child Transmission of HIV",,Bangkok,2016-06-08,Jakarta Globe,"Bangkok. When Anya Nopalit became pregnant with her first son, 16 years ago, she learned she had HIV and worried she would pass the virus on to him. Fortunately, Thailand had launched a program that year to provide antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and counseling for pregnant women with HIV, and her son was born free of the virus. A decade later, she had a second son — this time, armed with knowledge about how to monitor the amount of HIV in her blood — her viral load — and the CD4 cells protecting her from infection. She was confident that he would not get sick. ""With my first child, I was scared, but with my second, I was not scared at all because I knew what my viral load and CD4 levels were, and he wouldnt contract it,"" Anya said by telephone while at sea fishing in eastern Chanthaburi province. The World Health Organization announced on Wednesday (08/07) that Thailand has become the first Asian country to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. Elimination of transmission is defined as a reduction of transmission to such a low level that it no longer constitutes a public health problem. Last year, Cuba was the worlds first country to receive WHO validation for eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV. But Thailand, which is home to about 450,000 people living with HIV, is ""the first with a large HIV epidemic to ensure an AIDS-free generation,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""This is a remarkable achievement for a country where thousands of people live with HIV,"" Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the head of WHO for Southeast Asia, said in a statement. ""Thailand has demonstrated to the world that HIV can be defeated,"" she added. UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé called the achievement an important milestone in efforts to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Better coverage In the 1980s and 1990s, Thailand struggled with a huge HIV epidemic, with an estimated 143,000 new infections in 1991. Over the decades, it has conducted awareness and condom use campaigns, and provided free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for all Thais, cutting the estimated number of new infections to 8,100 in 2013. Thailands decision to provide all pregnant women — including undocumented migrant workers — free antenatal care, delivery and services for HIV and syphilis, pushed treatment coverage rates up, culminating in the validation of elimination of mother-to-child transmission, WHO said. Mother-to-child transmission has dropped to 85 children infected with HIV in 2015, from about 1,000 children infected in 2000, it said. According to Thai health authorities, the number of women newly infected with HIV fell to 1,900 in 2014, from 15,000 in 2000. Untreated, women living with HIV have a 15 percent to 45 percent chance of transmitting the virus to their children during pregnancy, labor, delivery or breastfeeding, WHO said. That risk drops to just over 1 percent if ARVs are given to mothers and children throughout the stages when infection can occur. According to the Thai Ministry of Public Health, 98 percent of all pregnant women living with HIV have access to ARVs, and the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV has been reduced to less than 2 percent.

Anti-Gay Hostility Threatens Indonesia's AIDS Battle: Activists,,Jakarta.,2018-07-05,Jakarta Globe,"Rising government and public hostility towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Indonesia is threatening the battle against AIDS in the worlds largest Muslim-majority country, activists and an official said. (Reuters Photo/Navesh Chitrakar) Jakarta. Rising government and public hostility towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Indonesia is threatening the battle against AIDS in the worlds largest Muslim-majority country, activists and an official said. Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia, except in the conservative province of Aceh, but the country has seen an increase in raids targeting LGBT people, which have forced many members of the community underground. The group Human Rights Watch said this week hostility was making it harder for the LGBT community to get access to public health programs, putting people at greater risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. ""The Indonesian government should recognize that its role in abuses against LGBT people is seriously compromising the countrys response to HIV,"" said Kyle Knight, LGBT rights researcher at HRW and author of the report. ""One particularly troubling aspect of the anti-LGBT panic is that public health outreach to such populations has become far more difficult, making wider spread of the disease more likely,"" the rights group said. The prevalence rate of HIV among gay men in Indonesia has jumped from 8.5 percent in 2011 to 25 percent in 2015, it said. Indonesia recorded 46,357 new HIV infections in 2017, with nearly a quarter of those among men who have sex with other men, according to government and Unaids data. Other groups included sex workers and intravenous drug users. A senior health official said the increasing hostility to the LGBT community was disrupting the relations between health workers and people who need their help. ""For a long time, health workers were able to meet these groups in certain places,"" Windra Waworuntu, director general of infectious diseases at the Ministry of Health, said on Wednesday (05/07). ""But with the anti-LGBT feeling now, health workers find it difficult to reach them. Its similar to when red light districts are broken up and health workers have difficulty in reaching sex workers."" A spokesman for President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo declined to comment when asked about rising anti-LGBT sentiment among the government and public but senior government officials have called for gay rights advocacy to be restricted. Indonesias parliament looks set to criminalize same-sex relations, something that Islamist groups have long pressed for, while police have stood by while vigilantes have stormed ""gay sex parties."" Police have also stepped up raids on gatherings at spas and hostels, charging some people with violating strict pornography laws.

Australia Declares AIDS No Longer Public Health Issue,,Sydney,2016-07-11,Jakarta Globe,"One in seven people with HIV in the Europe Union region is unaware they have the virus, seriously hampering efforts to meet a global 2030 deadline for eradicating the AIDS epidemic, a senior health expert said on Tuesday (29/11). (Reuters Photo/Raheb Homavandi) Sydney. Australia declared on Monday (11/07) the AIDS epidemic is no longer a public health issue there, a month after the United Nations adopted an ambitious target to eliminate the threat globally by 2030. The government-backed Australian Federation of AIDS Organizations (AFAO) and top scientists said the number of people being diagnosed with AIDS in Australia was now so small it was no longer reported. AIDS cases in Australia peaked in 1994, at 953 cases, according to the Kirby Institute for infection and immunity in society. Since then, following the introduction of anti-retroviral treatment, that prevent AIDS developing in people who are infected with the HIV virus, and awareness campaigns, AIDS diagnoses have declined sharply. ""Australia is incredibly fortunate to be in the position and its because of farsighted government policy,"" said Darryl ODonnell, chief executive AFAO. ""We had community organizations of sex workers and drug users doing outreach campaigns that were extraordinarily effective,"" ODonnell said. A spokeswoman for the Federal Department of Health said while it was tremendous that AIDS was ""not the automatic death sentence that it once was"", approximately 1,100 cases of HIV are detected each year. ""We must not let down our guard."" Worldwide there are 36.7 million people living with HIV, according to the World Health Organization, with 180,000 people dying from AIDS-related illness in the Asia-Pacific region last year. The United Nations agreed a new declaration on ending the AIDS epidemic at a meeting in New York last month. The UNAIDS Fast-Track approach to ending the AIDS epidemic has a set of time-bound targets, including reducing the number of people newly infected with HIV from 2.1 million in 2015 to fewer than 500,000 in 2020, reducing the number of people dying from AIDS-related illnesses from 1.1 million in 2015 to fewer than 500,000 in 2020 and eliminating HIV-related discrimination. Andrew Grulich, head of the HIV Epidemiology and Prevention Program at the Kirby Institute, said other countries could learn from Australia. ""The thing that has characterized Australia is a partnership between all sectors involved,"" he said. ""Community, research and the government — and having bipartisan political support.""

"In Europe, US, Modern AIDS Drugs Add Extra 10 Years of Life Expectancy",,London,2017-05-11,Jakarta Globe,"Life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe thanks to improvements in AIDS drugs known as antiretroviral therapy, researchers said on Thursday (11/05). (Reuters Photo/Raheb Homavandi) London. Life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe thanks to improvements in AIDS drugs known as antiretroviral therapy, researchers said on Thursday (11/05). This meant many patients can expect to live as long as those without HIV, according to their study published in The Lancet medical journal. The scientists said the improvements were likely to be largely due to the transition to less toxic medicine combinations, with more drug options for people infected with drug-resistant HIV strains, and better adherence to treatment. ""Our research illustrates a success story of how improved HIV treatments coupled with screening, prevention and treatment of health problems associated with HIV infection can extend the lifespan,"" said Adam Trickey, who led the research at Britains University of Bristol. Antiretroviral therapy, or ART, first became widely used in the mid 1990s. It involves a combination of three or more drugs that block the HIV virus replication. This helps prevent and repair damage to the immune system caused by HIV, and also prevents onward spread of the disease. The World Health Organization now recommends ART should be given as soon as possible after diagnosis to everyone with HIV. The researchers analyzed 18 European and North American studies involving 88,504 people with HIV who started ART between 1996 and 2010. Fewer people who started treatment between 2008-2010 died during their first three years of treatment than those who started treatment between 1996-2007. Trickeys team said when they looked specifically at deaths due to AIDS, the number during treatment declined over time between 1996 and 2010, probably because more modern drugs are more effective in restoring the immune system. As a result, the researchers said that between 1996 and 2013, the life expectancy of 20-year-olds treated for HIV increased by nine years for women and 10 years for men in the European Union and North America. This suggests that life expectancy of a 20-year-old who began ART from 2008 onwards and responded well to it would get close to a life expectancy of the general population – 78 years. But the improvements were not seen in all people with HIV. Life expectancy of those infected through injecting drugs, for example, did not increase as much as in other groups. Trickey said this underlined the need for prevention and treatment efforts to be focused on high-risk groups.

Falling Pregnant by Touching Boys? Africans Confront Sex Taboos With Education,,Dakar.,2015-10-09,Jakarta Globe,"While taboos surrounding sexual and reproductive health may be common among older generations across West and Central Africa. (Reuters Photo/Afolabi Sotunde) Dakar. When Sokhna Aminatou Sarr started menstruating, as a young girl in Senegal who had not yet reached her teenage years, her mother warned that she would become pregnant if she went near any boys. While taboos surrounding sexual and reproductive health may be common among older generations across West and Central Africa, they are also often perpetuated by teachers, religious leaders and health workers, the 27-year-old activist said. ""Doctors and nurses behave more like parents than health professionals, they should provide counselling and guidance but instead pass judgment,"" said Sarr, a representative for AIESEC, a global youth network that provides leadership opportunities. ""I knew a girl with a vaginal infection who was told by a nurse: You like sex too much, that is the problem."" Sarr was one of several young Africans who discussed sexual and reproductive health education at a United Nations conference attended by ministers, health experts and civil society representatives from 24 countries in West and Central Africa. The conference, which runs from Oct 7 to 9 in Dakar, aims to accelerate the implementation of sexual and reproductive healtheducation programs across the region, and make tackling HIV, teenage pregnancy and gender-based violence a priority. It takes place just weeks after the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 15-year objectives to combat a range of issues such as poverty, climate change and gender inequality — including a pledge to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. West and Central Africa is one of the worst regions in the world in terms of sexual and reproductive health among young people, with teenage girls the most vulnerable, according to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). The region has the highest pregnancy rate for girls aged 15-19, with 128 births per 1,000 girls. Four in 10 girls are married before they turn 18 and almost a fifth of girls under 14 have undergone female genital mutilation (FGM), Unesco said. Misunderstanding and suspicion Less than a quarter of a young women and a third of young men have adequate knowledge of HIV prevention measures, and there is a lack of age-appropriate health education for most young people in the region, according to the UN body. ""The fact that teenagers cannot discuss sexual health means they get misguided and inaccurate information online,"" said Romaric Ouitona, a 22-year-old who works as a young ambassador for a family planning organization in Benin. Sexual health education programs in the region often fall short because they focus on the biological rather than social aspects of sex, and are aimed at older teenagers, who are often already sexually active, the conference heard. Such education is often viewed with suspicion despite evidence showing it leads to youths having sex at a later age, a rise in condom use, and a lower number of sexual partners. The Niger government last year withdrew a course on sexual and reproductive health from the school syllabus after Islamic organisations said it was contrary to the countrys values. ""Representatives from across the region are aware not only of the need to improve sexual education programs, but also to involve local associations, religious leaders and faith groups to overcome taboos and cultural barriers,"" UNESCO representative Xavier Hospital said on the sidelines of the conference.

Challenges Remain in Indonesia's Health Care System: UN Expert,,,2017-04-05,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Following his first visit to Indonesia, UN Special Rapporteur Dainius Pūras said on Monday (03/04) that Indonesia is on the right track to develop an equitable and sustainable health care system, but warns that ""the country’s ambitious goals can be reached only if challenges are addressed."" Indonesia still faces a number of challenges i n securing the right to health for every citizen, Pūras noted . In particular, the UN health expert highlighted issues in sexual and reproductive health rights, mental health, HIV/AIDS, the health care situation in Papua and the right to health of drug users. Indonesia aims to achieve universal health coverage by 2019, but to ensure that no one in the country is left behind, Pūras said ""public authorities need to step up efforts to address structural and systemic issues."" Pūras visited Indonesia for two weeks – from March 22 to April 3 – and observed health facilities in Jakarta, Padang, Labuan Bajo and Jayapura to assess public satisfaction on the services, especially within the framework of health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Health care in Papua In his preliminary report, Pūras expressed his concerns regarding Papua, where generalized epidemic and infection rates are the highest throughout the country. ""Ethnic Papuans are two times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than the rest of the population, and new infections are increasing among this group,"" Pūras said. Due to historical, socio-economic and cultural factors, Papuans still face challenges both in access and effectiveness of response given to testing, treatment and health-related services. Pūras said Papua ""deserves special attention and efforts"" in order to build trust between service providers and users as well as to scale up investment in the health sector and enhance access, which he reminds need to be done ""in a culturally-sensitive manner."" Right to health of drug users In his report, Pūras also criticized Indonesia’s tough anti-drug policy, describing it as ""excessively punitive."" He said the current approach undermines the right to health for people who use drugs and overall public health efforts in the country. Alternatively, he said drug use should not be criminalized and the reporting on — as well as the rehabilitation for — drug use should not be compulsory, as it currently is. The drug policy in Indonesia is largely based on law enforcement, therefore limiting realization of the right to health which includes informed consent and the right to refuse treatment. ""Indonesia should invest more in prevention, education and information programs about drug use,"" Pūras said, adding that health care sectors have to take an active role in promoting evidence-based prevention, services and treatment for people who use drugs with respect to their autonomy, dignity and privacy. Sexual and reproductive health rights Education on sexuality in Indonesia is often limited to biology and reproduction, without addressing aspects of human rights and discrimination, sexuality or gender norms, Pūras added. According to him, these elements are essential for ""young people to make informed decision on their reproductive health and adopt healthy sexual behaviors."" Gender-based violence, and discrimination toward women and girls due to their social, cultural, and religious backgrounds – including those who are exposed to harmful practices such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) – are some of the key concerns brought up by the UN expert. To advance the right to health, in line with SDGs related to women, he urged the Indonesian government to pass the Elimination of Sexual Violence bill (RUU PKS). The bill is currently included in the priority list of the 2017 National Legislation Program (Prolegnas). HIV/AIDS Pūras found that over the past fifteen years, HIV transmission in Indonesia has overall started to decline and seem to have stabilized. However, prevalence of the auto-immune disease is still high among certain key affected populations; in particular men who have sex with men, transgender people and those who use drugs. Discrimination toward individuals and groups based on their sexual orientation and gender identity or gender expression contributes to increased vulnerabilities, including increased stigma and harassment in health care settings and HIV infection, Pūras said, quoting reports by the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan) and National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM). Furthermore, while HIV testing has increased in Indonesia, the numbers are still low. ""Normative, policy and institutional changes are necessary to remove serious barriers that hinder the effectiveness of the HIV response,"" Pūras said, adding that increasing efforts in reaching out to most-at-risk populations are needed. There is also reason to be more concerned with the National AIDS Commission ending its term next year. Although the commission’s function and responsibility will be absorbed by the Ministry of Health, Pūras argued that an independent body is crucial in addressing the issues surrounding HIV/AIDS and urged the Indonesian government to reinstate the commission with a strong, independent mandate and sufficient resources.",{},"['national', 'drug', 'indonesias', 'sexual', 'care', 'health', 'challenges', 'indonesia', 'expert', 'rights', 'pūras', 'papua', 'right', 'remain', 'system']","Indonesia still faces a number of challenges i n securing the right to health for every citizen, Pūras noted .

Myanmar Refugee Doctor Wins Humanitarian Prize for Clinic in Thailand,,London,2016-11-18,Jakarta Globe,"A group of Rohingya Muslims that attacked Myanmar border guards in October is headed by people with links to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, the International Crisis Group, or ICG, said on Thursday (15/12), citing members of the group. (Reuters Photo/Soe Zeya Tun) London. When Cynthia Maung saw the suffering of fellow refugees who had fled Myanmars crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the late 1980s and sought sanctuary in neighboring Thailand, she knew she had to do something about it. Maung, a doctor, decided to rally other medical professionals in the refugee camps in northwestern Thailand to help her open a clinic in the border town of Mae Sot. Starting in 1988 with only four beds, the clinic has developed into a fully-fledged health facility providing inpatient services, surgery and trauma care, dental care, vaccinations and HIV prevention. It treats more than 75,000 patients a year. ""The number of patients that arrive at the clinic each year is on the rise,"" said Maung, who received an international award on Wednesday (16/11) in recognition of her humanitarian work. ""We also train health workers and provide outreach services for patients who require access to medical attention closer to their communities,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""But the biggest challenge we face is in dealing with the trauma suffered by the displaced and their concerns about food, health care and job insecurities,"" Maung said before she was due to receive the AidEx Humanitarian Hero of the Year Award in Brussels. Maung, from the Karen ethnic group, said she was concerned about a military crackdown in western Myanmar which has forced hundreds of Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh, trying to escape violence that has brought the number of dead confirmed by the army to more than 130. Some of the Rohingya were gunned down as they tried to cross the Naaf river that separates Myanmar and Bangladesh, while others arriving by boat were pushed away by Bangladeshi border guards and may be stranded at sea, residents said. The bloodshed is the most serious since hundreds were killed in communal clashes in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine in 2012. It has exposed the lack of oversight of the military by the seven-month-old administration of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. ""Fighting along the borders is still going on. That has left thousands of people displaced as a result and there hasnt been much improvement in regions still controlled by the military,"" Maung said. ""... those especially from ethnic minorities remain very anxious about their future. They want to see if the government in Burma will be all inclusive."" Mae Sot in Thailand is home to thousands of refugees from Myanmar who have fled conflict and violence, as well as tens of thousands of migrant workers, many of whom are in low-skilled, backbreaking jobs.

WHO Urges Action Over Growing Hepatitis Epidemic,,London,2017-04-21,Jakarta Globe,"London. The number of people dying from hepatitis is rising, and most of the 325 million infected are unaware they have the virus and lack access to potentially life-saving medicines, the World Health Organization said on Friday (21/04). In its first global report on the infection, the WHO said that with millions at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer and premature death, swift action on testing and treatment was needed. ""Viral hepatitis is now a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,"" the WHOs director general Margaret Chan said in a statement. The 325 million cases reported are of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) – the main types of the five different hepatitis infections and responsible for 96 percent of deaths from the disease. HBV infection requires lifelong treatment, for which the WHO recommends tenofovir, a generic antiviral drug also used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured relatively swiftly, but the medicines are too expensive for many patients. Pressure over pricing has been growing, notably on US manufacturer Gilead Sciences — which has developed some of the most effective treatments — and the company has taken some steps to offer discounts and provide access programs. That includes allowing Indian drugmakers to manufacture much lower-cost versions of them for sale in developing countries. Gottfried Hirnschall, director of WHOs Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Program, said the WHO was working with governments, drugmakers and diagnostics companies to improve access. ""More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need — a diagnostic test costs less than $1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below $200,"" he said. ""But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment."" Viral hepatitis killed 1.34 million people in 2015, a toll comparable to tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. But while TB and AIDS deaths are falling, hepatitis deaths are on the rise and have increased by 22 percent since 2000, the WHO said. Around 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total to 71 million, with experts identifying unsafe healthcare procedures and injection drug use as the top causes. New B virus infections are falling, thanks to a vaccine given as a part of childhood immunization that 84 percent of babies born in 2015 were given, according to the WHO report.

Bantar Gebang: Trials and Tribulations of Indonesia's 'Trash Heroes',,Bekasi.,2019-02-08,Jakarta Globe,"Bekasi. Every day is Christmas for flies and trash-pickers alike at Bantar Gebang in Bekasi, West Java. A haze of bugs hovers over the stench of rotting food and mounds of fermenting garbage in Southeast Asias largest uncovered landfill site, while people crowd under diggers, being showered in tons of Jakartas rubbish, desperately hoping to find the best moneymaker for the day, dinner for their children or perhaps a new roof for their homes. Among all the decay, there is new life. Baby chicks, goats, kittens and puppies frolic through the chaos. Children roll around on mattresses, giggling as they build structures with sticks, and treasure the toys they acquired from the landfill as their most prized possessions. Scavengers are scattered across the gigantic mountain of trash. Women and men carry huge baskets on their backs, loading them with whatever useful they can find to provide them with sustenance or an income. One thing is for sure, it is a hard life for these ""trash-heroes,"" as it provides neither thanks nor dignity, instead posing many dangers, diseases and dire living conditions. These people own nothing they have not acquired from the landfill and yet, they are smiling, happy and generous. Insisting that we take refuge in their personal spaces to shelter from the rain. The estimated 3,000 families that reside and work at Bantar Gebang have very humble abodes, but they are immaculate; perfectly mopped floors, uncluttered living spaces and freshly laundered clothes hang from their patios, showing the pride they have in personal hygiene. A trash-picker makes her way down an 80-meter mountain of trash at Bantar Gebang. (JG Photo/Aleasha Bliss) Resa Boenard, lovingly nicknamed ""Princess of the Dump,"" created BGBJ (Seeds of Bantar Gebang) to provide education, food and empowerment to the children of the landfill, aiming to break the cycle of poverty and encourage them to continue with school. BGBJ is a little piece of paradise in the heart of the landfill, it is also her home, which she opens on Sundays to foreigners, who can stay in the hostel, help with maintenance, build toilets and teach the children new skills, showing them that there is life outside the landfill. Her foundation is ""built on love,"" and offers a sense of family and community, provides birthday celebrations and offers a free, healthy meal once a week to each of her students. Health Problems Skin conditions, injuries and respiratory problems are the leading health concerns among the workers in Bantar Gebang. It takes a lot to make one of them sick as they are used to eating off the landfill and their immune systems are quite strong, Resa said. It is only upon falling ill that it can turn deadly fast as the workers have no access to proper care and go downhill quite quickly. ""I heard about Doctors Without Borders, but dont know how to access that one,"" Resa said cheekily. ""I would love BGBJ to have medical assistance. Since 2004, when we started our organization, its been difficult to find medical professionals, such as dentists,"" she said. Once, one of her students named Alec developed an infection in his knee. His family could not afford medical assistance for him and started treating the pus-filled wound with powder and flour, and finally, perfume as the infection became worse and began to smell. ""It made me want to puke. I loved this little boy and wanted to help him; I went around every day and cleaned the wound and taught the mother to clean the wound properly,"" Resa recounts. She got the boy help from a doctor and paid for the medicine to help him recover. She said the people of Bantar Gebang are often scared of hospitals and their lack of money sees them turn to home remedies, while many illnesses and injuries result in death. ""We teach them how to clean their bodies and stuff – but maybe not enough. If they heard it from a doctor, it would be powerful,"" she said. Sexually Transmitted Disease HIV is also an issue at Bantar Gebang, not only due to drug abuse and accidental needle jabs. There has been an influx of prostitutes setting up shop very close by, resulting in the spread of this infectious disease. ""HIV exists in Bantar Gebang because of human behavior. Bantar Gebang is not far from a prostitute area. I knew a few people that died from it. In Indonesia, if they catch HIV, they hide it; like a secret. Because people are embarrassed, and they dont get the right treatment for the disease,"" Resa said. BGBJ presents workshops on HIV and AIDS, so the people know it exists and understand the consequences and ways to avoid contracting it. Resa believes this is an important lesson the children must learn, not just to prevent the spread of the disease, but also to discourage the students from becoming prostitutes in the future. Ranto, 48, is a former soldier and employs 50 people, aged between 17 and 45, to recycle plastic bottles at Bantar Gebang. He sells the plastic to external recycling companies and the business makes about $100 a day, which is split according to the weight in plastic each employee collected. Many of his employees are unskilled workers, have criminal records, are uneducated, or have grown up at the landfill site, which was created on rice paddies in 1989. He said a worker died earlier that day after falling into a crusher. It was not known whether it was an accident or suicide. Injuries are a regular occurrence at Bantar Gebang and with the medical assistance Resa is hoping to get from her sponsors, the 3,000 families living at the dump will have happier and healthier lives. ""Contributions are not always monetary, as the experience and skills the children are gaining is crucial to their development and hopefully will make them want to achieve outside Bantar Gebang. Skills and smiles are welcomed,"" Resa said.

BNN Requests Ban on Website Selling Marijuana Brownies,,Jakarta.,2015-04-14,Jakarta Globe,"The BNN busted an online operation selling cannabis brownies and arrested three people on Monday. (Antara Photo/Hafidz Mubarak) Jakarta. Indonesias National Narcotics Agency, or BNN, has requested the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology block a website that has been selling marijuana brownies. The narcotics agency said on Monday it had busted the online operation and arrested three people, including a man identified as IR, who owns a marijuana paraphernalia shop in Blok M, South Jakarta. The 38-year-old had been selling the brownies through website www.tokohemp.com for six months with the help of two friends, the BNN said. ""BNN does not have the authority to close down the website, we will write a request letter to the Ministry of Information and Technology [sic] who is authorized to do so,"" said Insp. Gen. Deddy Fauzi Elhakim, deputy head of the BNN, on Tuesday. Police seized four kilograms of marijuana, 12 boxes of cake flour, cake tins, blenders, mixers, scales, and 15 boxes of chocolate, when they raided IRs home in Tangerang, Banten. IR told the police he started selling the brownies to help people like himself, who were living with HIV and Hepatitis C, that used marijuana for pain relief. ""I just wanted to treat my HIV and Hepatitis C, I believe consuming marijuana will make me feel better but Im afraid the police will find out if I sold the marijuana in joints, so I made the brownies,"" IR said at BNN headquarters in East Jakarta on Monday. Deddy said the BNN launched an investigation into the online dealers after they received a report that a junior high school student was asleep for two days straight after eating the brownies.

Deadly Air Pollution Shortens Lives by Nearly 2 Years: Researchers,,New York,2018-11-22,Jakarta Globe,"Air pollution, caused largely by burning fossil fuels, is cutting global life expectancy by an average of 1.8 years per person, making it the worlds top killer, researchers said on Monday. (Reuters Photo/Ognen Teofilovski) New York. Air pollution, caused largely by burning fossil fuels, is cutting global life expectancy by an average of 1.8 years per person, making it the worlds top killer, researchers said on Monday. The tiny particles ingested from polluted air shorten life more than first-hand cigarette smoke, which can reduce it by 1.6 years, and are more dangerous than other public health threats such as war and HIV/AIDS, they said. The University of Chicagos Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) shows people in parts of India, the worlds second-largest country by population, could live 11 years less due to high levels of air pollution. Life expectancy averages slightly below 69 in the South Asian nation of 1.3 billion, according to the World Bank. The researchers launched a website that tells users how many years of life air pollution could cost them according to which region of a country they live in. The index seeks to transform hard-to-comprehend data into ""perhaps the most important metric that exists – life,"" Michael Greenstone, director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (Epic), said in a statement. Particulate pollution is normally measured in micrograms per cubic meter. ""The fact that this AQLI tool quantifies the number of years I and you have lost to air pollution makes me worried,"" Kalikesh Deo, an Indian member of parliament, said in a statement shared by Epic. China and Indonesia are also among the countries where microscopic particles floating in the air hit residents the hardest, cutting their life expectancy by as much as seven years and five and a half years respectively, the website shows. Other studies have previously looked into the number of people who may die prematurely because of air pollution. But the Epic scientists hope the website – the first of its kind, according to the institute – will make the consequences of policies that promote dirty energy more tangible, and encourage reforms that promote better air quality. Only a handful of Indias 100 most polluted cities have drawn up plans to combat air pollution despite being asked to do so three years ago, a report from the World Health Organization said earlier this year.

Blood For Life Indonesia: Give Blood to Give Life,,Jakarta.,2016-08-24,Jakarta Globe,"One in seven people with HIV in the Europe Union region is unaware they have the virus, seriously hampering efforts to meet a global 2030 deadline for eradicating the AIDS epidemic, a senior health expert said on Tuesday (29/11). (Reuters Photo/Raheb Homavandi) Jakarta. With a population of 250 million people, the need for blood supply in Indonesia at an all time high. In light of World Humanitarian Day last Friday (19/08), the Jakarta Globe had the opportunity to interview the chairwoman of Blood For Life Indonesia, Yudhinia Venkanteswari, who is better known as Ririe, to talk about the importance of blood donation. Blood For Life Indonesia was founded in 2009 by Valencia Mieke Randa, to provide a platform to connect people who need blood with those who are willing to donate blood, as well as to provide information about blood donation generally. What started out as a mailing list of 44 members has grown into a community with as many as 100,000 followers on Twitter. Q: What’s the difference between the Indonesian Red Cross Society and Blood For Life? The Indonesian Red Cross Society, or PMI, is the national blood service agency, which ensures that there is an adequate and safe supply of blood for all patients who require transfusions. Blood For Life supports the cause by two main activities: first, to connect patients that require transfusions with voluntary unpaid blood donors through social media. Second, to educate the community on the need for voluntary unpaid blood donors. This is done through our fundraising activities and events, where we also sell merchandise, especially for those who aren’t able to donate blood. How does Blood For Life work? Are blood donators required to visit a hospital? Blood shortages at PMI is very common, where patient’s relatives are requested by the hospital staff to donate blood. However, it is compulsory for every patient who requires a transfusion to have a number of replacement donors for emergency admissions, or before planned surgeries. This is where we come in, through a virtual emergency room run and administered 24/7 on Twitter and Facebook through Blood4LifeID and a hotline. How it works is that the patient’s relatives contact Blood For Life through social media accounts or a hotline, then the administrator will take down the blood requirements of the patient and post them up via social media. Thanks to our volunteers and partners, we have better coverage and this is how we find matches. Our administrators will then contact the volunteers who turn out to be a match through the database or Twitter and Facebook and direct them to a specific blood drive or hospital. We also actively monitor the status of the situation. Are blood donators able to donate anonymously? Since important medical history details are recorded, technically, it’s not anonymous. Are blood donators compensated? In Indonesia, blood donors donate their blood without being compensated. Additionally, according to the World Health Organization’s guidelines, blood donations should be voluntary. Can anyone donate blood? Yes, but they are selected after an interview and physical examination has been conducted. This includes an examination of their age, hemoglobin levels, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, weight as well as taking note of the last time a donor has given blood. This is to protect recipients, donors and minimize any risks when donating blood. Donors must be between the ages of 17-65 and weigh at least 45 kilograms. A blood donor can only donate blood after a span of three months. What blood type is the rarest in Indonesia? Among the four base ABO blood types discovered by Karl Landsteiner, the father of blood group identification, AB minus is found to be the rarest, not only in Indonesia but also in the world. Which patients need blood donations most? First of all, there are two types of blood donations, whole blood and aphaeresis donations. Aphaeresis is the process used to collect blood platelets from the donor’s blood and it takes a little longer to collect, as the donor’s red blood cells will be returned during the donation. Whole blood donation is when it’s just straight up blood. After, it is then usually separated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets. The donations can be used for patients with cancer, blood diseases, hemophilia, anemia, childbirth complications, operations and a lot more. Plasma is a pale, yellow colored liquid where red and white blood cells float in with platelets and plasma donations are used for immune system conditions, pregnancy, bleeding and muscle and nerve conditions, as it carries special nutrients. Whereas platelets are tiny blood plates which help reduce bleeding. They’re commonly needed by people with cancer, leukemia, surgery and liver disease. Blood donations using an aphaeresis machine gives a higher volume of concentrated plasma or platelets for each donation. One bag of platelets from aphaeresis is equivalent to six-10 bags of platelets from regular blood donations. What is the biggest challenge for PMI and Blood For Life? Based on WHO’s standards, the minimum stock of blood a country should have is around 5.1 million blood bags, or enough to provide for 2 percent of the population. But according to the Ministry of Health, Indonesia’s blood bank stock is only at 4.6 million bags. Therefore, Indonesia has a shortage of 500 thousand blood bags. People are still not donating blood because some are afraid of the needle, while others just don’t realize the importance of blood donations. What if you or your loved ones need blood? Somebody needs to ensure that PMI has enough stock. The need for blood is constant, so is the need for donations. Why should people donate blood? What is the importance of doing so? People do not need a special reason to donate blood, they just need a reason of their own. There is a sense of accomplishment after donating blood, after knowing that they have just helped save some lives. Our founder Valencia, who is better known as Kak Silly, always reminds the team and the volunteers that we should feel good by doing good things. On top of that, by donating blood, it’s an automatic regular health checkup. Every successful donation is memorable to us. How many blood donation requests has Blood For Life been able to fulfill? We can say that on average, we have 200 requests for blood per month, and every transaction is a successful one. We never turn down a request. We usually get a lot more requests during the holiday season and fasting month, as donors are mostly fasting or are away when contacted. This year, January recorded the highest number of social media postings with 291 requests, while in June, there were 260.",{},"['donations', 'donate', 'platelets', 'life', 'donors', 'blood', 'red', 'patients', 'indonesia', 'need']","Blood For Life Indonesia was founded in 2009 by Valencia Mieke Randa, to provide a platform to connect people who need blood with those who are willing to donate blood, as well as to provide information about blood donation generally.

E. Java Lawmakers Want to Ban Girls From Graduating School if Not Virgins,,,2015-02-06,Jakarta Globe,"[This story was updated at 10:27 p.m on Friday, Feb. 6, 2015, to correct the population number of Jember] Jakarta. Across a vast archipelagic country with diverse sets of values and a strongly decentralized political framework — local politicians in Indonesia can be relied on to come out with the occasional bizarre idea. But a breathtakingly misogynistic bill currently being considered by lawmakers in East Java has raised the bar. The city council of Jember wants to give a virginity test to all schoolgirls. The city will prohibit them from graduating high school if they ""fail"" the test. Jember is the third-largest urban area in East Java with a population of about 2.3 million people, according to the Central Statistics Acencys (BPS) 2010 census. ""What surprises us the most is they have had sex several times and with different partners,"" Habib Isa Mahdi, a lawmaker from the Peoples Conscience Party (Hanura), told Detik.com on Friday. ""Moreover, the Ministry of Social Affairs said that Indonesia is in an emergency situation against pornography — thats what drives us to make such regulation."" The idea was first debated during a meeting between the city councils Commission D and the Jember Education Agency on Wednesday. The council is drafting a regulation on ""good conduct,"" which includes an article installing a virginity test as a requirement for female students graduation. The city council argued the regulation was necessary because many secondary and high school students were engaging in pre-marital sexual activities. Isa claimed that based on the data gathered from local hospitals, around 10 percent of Jembers approximately 1,200 HIV/AIDS patients were students. The Jakarta Globe could not immediately verify Isas claims. ""Theres a need to protect our children,"" he said. ""Jember has to be brave to act to save them."" The Jember Chapter of Nadhlatul Ulama (NU), the second-largest Muslim organization in Indonesia, opposed the proposal. ""Virginity is very sensitive. If a female student cannot meet the requirement, shell be the subject of gossip in the society,"" Jembers policy chief for NU, MN Harisuddin, told the organizations official website on Thursday. ""Say the bill is passed, the test would be simple to conduct, but why is it only done for the female students? How about the boys?"" Mufti Ali, a lawmaker from National Awakening Party (PKB), told East Java news portal BeritaJatim.com this week that he wanted to expand the proposal beyond Jember to become a provincial law. ""If theyre not virgins anymore, dont let them pass,"" he said. ""It may sound like a joke, but its serious. Its for the sake of the future. ""I agree that virginity should become a [requirement] for graduation. I will tell my friends to make it a regional regulation. We cant only rely on their conscience to behave well. There should also be pressure. If theyre pushed [to behave well], that bad behavior can improve."" On the question of the regulations obvious sexism, Mufti offers a pragmatic defense. ""We cant test the boys,"" he told the East Java news portal. ""But at least with the regulation, girls will be afraid [to have pre-marital sex]. The boys will be prevented from the act because girls will become unwilling. This will scare them, that if they [have sex], they will not graduate."" And proving that he has an answer to everything to defend the proposal, Mufti says that victims of rape undergoing the test have nothing to worry about. ""The medical team will be able to tell [if they have been the victim of a sexual assault],"" he said. Indonesia has drawn international condemnation for its often-vicarious relationship with evidence-based policy to battle social and health problems, from HIV transmission to drug trafficking. The trade minister said this week that he would push through a ban on imported clothes partly because used clothing could transmit the HIV virus. He later apologized. Demands for virginity are not limited to the male politicians of Jember, Indonesias police often use the degrading virginity test as a pre-condition for employing its female officers. Correction: An earlier version of this story stated in the third paragraph that the population of Jember, East Java, is 300,000; it is not.

Jakarta Looks to Moscow for Planned Submarine Purchase,,Jakarta.,2015-09-21,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu says the government will prioritize purchasing new submarines over fighters jets — and that it intends to buy them from Russia. “The president has ordered the new purchase. Rather than buying 10 secondhand units [of submarines], it is better to purchase five new ones instead,” Ryamizard said in Jakarta on Monday after a closed-door meeting with legislators. He added that Russian submarines would likely be chosen based on several considerations. “Russian submarines can dive longer and deeper than any others. They can also shoot under the sea,” Ryamizard said. (All submarines can do this.) As for fighter jets, the government will probably only purchase new ones next year, the minister said. “We still have ... fighter jets. What is important is [to build more] runways,” the minister said.

"Scientists, Officials in China Abhor Gene Editing That Geneticist Claims",,Beijing/Shanghai,2018-11-28,Jakarta Globe,"Scientist He Jiankui shows The Human Genome, a book he edited, at his company Direct Genomics in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China on Aug. 4, 2016. (Reuters Photo/Stringer) Beijing/Shanghai. Chinese officials and scientists denounced on Tuesday the claims of a geneticist who said he had created the first gene-edited babies, and a hospital linked to his research suggested its ethical approval had been forged. More than 100 scientists said in an open letter the use of Crispr-Cas9 technology to edit the genes of human embryos was risky, unjustified and harmed the reputation and development of the biomedical community in China. In videos posted online, scientist He Jiankui defended what he said he had achieved – embryonic gene editing to help protect twin baby girls born this month from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. ""Pandoras box has been opened. We still might have a glimmer of hope to close it before its too late,"" the scientists said in their letter, a copy of which was posted by the Chinese news website the Paper. ""The biomedical ethics review for this so-called research exists in name only. Conducting direct human experiments can only be described as crazy,"" the approximately 120 scientists said in the Chinese-language letter. Yang Zhengang, a Fudan University professor, told Reuters he signed the letter because gene editing was ""very dangerous."" Chinas Genetics Society and the Chinese Society for Stem Cell Research said in a statement He had acted as an ""individual"" and his work posed ""tremendous safety risks for the research subjects."" ""We believe the research led by He is strongly against both the Chinese regulations and the consensus reached by the international science community,"" the two groups said in a statement posted online. Crispr-Cas9 is a technology that allows scientists to essentially cut-and-paste DNA, raising hope of genetic fixes for disease. However, there are also concerns about its safety and ethics. He, who is due to speak at a summit on human genome editing at the University of Hong Kong on Wednesday, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Shenzhen Harmonicare Hospital, listed on Chinas online clinical trial registry as having given ethical approval for Hes experiment, denied having ever taken part in any clinical operations relating to ""gene-edited babies."" The signatures on the online form were suspected of having been forged and ""no relevant meeting of the Medical Ethics Committee of the hospital in fact took place,"" Hong Kong-listed Harmonicare Medical Holdings said in a statement. Very Shocked The Southern University of Science and Technology, where He holds an associate professorship, also said it had been unaware of the research project and that He had been on leave without pay since February. The Shenzhen City Science and Innovation Committee, a municipal fund which was also listed on the clinical trial registry as having backed the trial, said in a statement on Monday it had never been involved in the project. Xu Nanping, vice minister of Chinas science and technology ministry, told reporters he was ""very shocked"" on hearing Hes claim, adding that such work had been prohibited since 2003. Details of the case were still unclear, Xu said. ""We dont know if this work is real or fake. If its real, then this is certainly banned in China."" The official Xinhua news agency said ethics could not be ignored. ""Scientific exploration is never-ending ... but this does not mean that the morals of science can be abandoned or that ethical standards can be ignored,"" the news agency said in a comment posted on social media. The National Health Commission said on Monday it was ""highly concerned"" and had ordered provincial health officials ""to immediately investigate and clarify the matter."" The governments medical ethics committee in Shenzhen said it was investigating the case, as was the Guangdong provincial health commission, according to Southern Metropolis Daily, a state media outlet. The committee organizing the Hong Kong conference where He is due to speak – the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing – said in a statement on Monday it had only just been informed of Hes work on the genes of the twin girls.

Parliament Soon to Decide Fate of Chemical Castration Regulation,,Jakarta.,2016-08-23,Jakarta Globe,"Staff at two Chinese hospitals have been punished after their failure to follow proper medical procedures caused 14 patients to be infected with HIV and hepatitis B, state media reported on Friday (10/09). (Antara Photo/Muhammad Adimaja) Jakarta. Lawmakers on Tuesday (23/08) will decide whether or not to pass a government-proposed regulation that seeks tougher penalties on child sex offenders — which also include chemical castration — amid widespread controversy. The move comes around a month after most political party factions at the House of Representatives agreed to bring the regulation before Tuesdays plenary meeting for enactment. Last months agreement was made despite three factions remaining undecided on the regulation — the Democratic Party, the Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra) Party and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS). House speaker Ade Komarudin said ""everyone should abide by the regulation if it is unanimously approved by the parliament."" Members of the Indonesian Doctors Association (IDI) have refused to perform chemical castration, an additional penalty which involves injecting male offenders with female hormones to suppress their sex drive. Citing ethical concerns, the doctors reiterated their rejection a day before last months agreement, prompting the three party factions to raise concerns over its implementation. But government officials have staunchly defended the regulation, believing it would deter offenders and put an end to what President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo has declared as a state of emergency. Jokowi signed off on a Perppu, or regulation in lieu of law, around three months ago to revise the existing law on child protection. Aside from chemical castration, it also seeks a range of heavy punishments for child sex offenders — including 20-year prison term, life imprisonment and the death penalty.",{},"['castration', 'decide', 'months', 'sex', 'soon', 'chemical', 'fate', 'child', 'offenders', 'factions', 'parliament', 'state', 'regulation', 'party']","Lawmakers on Tuesday (23/08) will decide whether or not to pass a government-proposed regulation that seeks tougher penalties on child sex offenders — which also include chemical castration — amid widespread controversy.

Bullets Trump Rehab as Asia Quickens 'Failing' War on Drugs,,Bangkok/Yangon,2016-09-14,Jakarta Globe,"A man injects heroin into his arm along a street in Man Sam, northern Shan state, Myanmar July 11, 2016. Picture taken July 11, 2016. (Reuters Photo/Soe Zeya Tun) Bangkok/Yangon. The Philippines has launched a bloody ""war on drugs"" that has killed at least 2,400 people in just two months, while neighboring Indonesia has declared a ""narcotics emergency"" and resumed executing drug convicts after a long hiatus. In Thailand and Myanmar, petty drug users are being sentenced to long jail terms in prisons already bursting at the seams. The soaring popularity of methamphetamine - a cheap and highly addictive drug also known as meth - is driving countries across Asia to adopt hardline anti-narcotics policies. Experts say they are likely to only make things worse. Geoff Monaghan has seen it all before. He investigated narco-trafficking gangs during his 30-year career as a detective with Londons Metropolitan Police, then witnessed the impact of draconian anti-drug policies as an HIV/AIDS expert in Russia. ""We have plenty of data but often we forget the history,"" said Monaghan. ""Thats the problem."" He believes President Rodrigo Dutertes anti-drugs campaign in the Philippines will fuel more violence and entrench rather than uproot trafficking networks. ""Im very fearful about the situation,"" he said. Reflecting the regional explosion in use, the amount of meth seized in East and Southeast Asia almost quadrupled from about 11 tons in 2009 to 42 tons in 2013, said the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The only region seizing more meth was North America, where the booming trade inspired the popular television series ""Breaking Bad"". Meth was the ""primary drug of concern"" in nine Asian countries, the UNODC said, including Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. PLAYING CATCH-UP A rising chorus of experts blame this surge in production and use of meth in Asia on ineffective and even counterproductive government responses. They say national drug-control policies are skewed towards harsh measures that criminalize users but have failed to staunch the deluge of drugs or catch the kingpins behind it. They also want a greater emphasis on reducing demand through more and better quality drug rehabilitation. ""There is so much scaremongering and hysteria surrounding the issue of drugs,"" says Gloria Lai of the International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC), a global network of 154 non-governmental groups. ""Thats a disincentive for challenging old ways of thinking."" Meth is a transnational business, worth around $15 billion in mainland Southeast Asia alone in 2013, the UNODC says. Much of the production takes place in laboratories in lawless western Myanmar. Ingredients such as pseudoephedrine and caffeine are smuggled across porous borders from India, China and Vietnam. Laos and Thailand are major trafficking routes, with the finished product travelling by road or along the Mekong River for distribution throughout Southeast Asia and China. Meth is sold in cheap pills called ""ya ba"", a Thai name meaning ""crazy medicine"", or in a more potent, crystalline form known as ""crystal meth"", ""ice"" or ""shabu"". Contraband is effectively hidden amid rising volumes of regional trade, leaving law enforcement to play catch-up, said Jeremy Douglas, the UNODCs Asia Pacific chief. ""We need to start thinking about big-time regional engagement, up to the highest level. Its impossible to deal with the problem on a country-by-country basis,"" he said. ""I cant recall the last time a major trafficking kingpin was caught."" SOCIAL COST The meth explosion carries huge social consequences: overburdened health services, overcrowded prisons, families and communities torn apart. Small-time users and dealers bear the brunt of unsparing law enforcement that is popular in crime-weary communities. In mid-July, as drug war killings escalated in the Philippines, one survey put President Dutertes approval rating at 91 percent. Thailand launched an equally popular ""war on drugs"" in 2003 that rights activists said killed about 2,800 people in three months, a death toll later halved by a government-appointed inquiry. Figures show it had no lasting impact on meth supply or demand in Thailand. ""The world has lost the war on drugs, not only Thailand,"" the countrys justice minister Paiboon Koomchaya told Reuters in July. Paiboon hinted at a radical shift in policy, saying he wanted to reclassify meth to reduce sentences for possessing and dealing the drug. For now though, Thailand continues to jail thousands of petty drug users, with about 70 percent of its 300,000 or so prisoners jailed on drugs offences, according to government data. TOUGH TO TREAT Meth addiction is tough to treat, ideally requiring costly and time-consuming counselling. Long-term use can cause changes in brain structure and function. In March, US President Barack Obama said drug dependency should be seen as ""a public health problem and not a criminal problem"", part of a bid to roll back a ""war on drugs"" begun in the 1970s and now widely seen as a failure. Policy in Asia is largely moving in the opposite direction, with drug rehabilitation underfunded and inadequate. Less than 1 percent of dependent drug users in Indonesia got treatment in 2014, said the UNODC. Lacking alternatives, desperate Indonesians resort to herbal baths, Islamic prayer and other remedies of unproven efficacy. ""Rehab"" in many countries often means detention at a state facility. In Thailand, thousands of users are held at army camps for four months. Relapse rates at drug detention centers range from 60-90 percent, says the World Health Organisation. ""Often, the government response causes more harm to an individual than the drug itself,"" said the IDPCs Lai. Evidence shows that the most effective treatment is voluntary and community-based. A 2015 study in Malaysia found that half the people at compulsory centers relapsed within 32 days of release, compared with 429 days for those who had volunteered for treatment. Tackling demand is complicated by meths broad appeal across different ages, professions and social classes. In Myanmar, manual laborers claim that smoking ya ba boosts their stamina, while students say it boosts their grades. A Yangon student who asked to be identified by the nickname ""Nick"" told Reuters at a grim state-run rehab clinic that he smoked ya ba to help him concentrate on his studies. When asked how many of his fellow students also used it, Nick replied: ""Almost all of them.""

Islam and Family Planning in Indonesia: Force for Good or Obstacle to Change?,,,2016-04-12,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Family planning experts insist that in countries like Indonesia, there needs to be greater engagement of faith-based communities to make sure everybody’s sexual and reproductive health needs are met. But in this sprawling Muslim-majority archipelago, activists face a variety of challenges. That doesn’t stop them from trying, though, with some pursuing a rights-based approach firmly rooted in religion and co-opting the very Islamic terminology others use to justify the status quo. “Every human being, whatever way you swing it, has some connection with the unknown,” Undersecretary-General Babatunde Osotimehin, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), told the Jakarta Globe in an interview. “We must never underestimate the role of faith in peoples ideas and beliefs, and what they will and will not do.” Speaking on the sidelines of the International Conference on Family Planning in Bali, which was opened by President Joko Widodo and attended by over 4,400 experts and other stakeholders from all over the world earlier this year, Osotimehin stressed that religion will remain important for many people all over the world. “This is just not about Catholicism, or Christianity as a whole, it is not about Islam alone, or Buddhism, or whatever,” he said. “Faith is a very powerful force in the world. That is what we need to understand.” Are two kids enough? Indonesia is a bustling democracy with an overwhelmingly young population of over 250 million souls, and over 85 percent identifying as Muslims. The major challenges in terms of family planning — and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in general — include uneven development, high maternal mortality rates (in many cases due to unsafe abortion) and growing numbers of people living with HIV and Aids, particularly women and youngsters. Related problems are high rates of child marriage and the continued prevalence of female genital mutilation in spite of a government ban. On the upside, Indonesia’s family planning program — and its well-known motto Dua Anak Cukup (Two Kids Is Enough) — has been very successful since its start in the late 1960s, lowering the total fertility rate (TFR) from 5.6 to 2.6 in recent years. However, the decline has started to stall and the TFR target of 2.1 remains out of reach. Some say this is a consequence of an Islamic revival in the officially secular nation since the fall of strongman Suharto in 1998 and subsequent democratization and decentralization of power. One of the groups benefiting from greater freedom of speech in Indonesia is Hizb ut-Tahrir, which describes itself as “a political party whose ideology is Islam” and its stated objective is “to resume the Islamic way of life by establishing an Islamic State that executes the systems of Islam and carries its call to the world.” The organization is not to be confused with the Islamic State movement in Syria and Iraq, which has been denounced publicly both by the international HT organization and by its Indonesian branch, Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI). HTI says a Shariah-based caliphate — to be established through education and other non-violent means — is the only way to properly protect families, especially women and children. When asked about family planning challenges in Indonesia, Iffah Ainur Rochmah, a spokeswoman for HTI, told the Jakarta Globe that family planning (or tanzim an nasl in Arabic) is allowed in Islam, but not birth control (tahdid an nasl), and only as long as there are no permanent alterations to the body. The decision to regulate one’s fertility should be made at the family level, Iffah said, and not by the government. The Indonesian government should therefore refrain from portraying families with just two children in a more positive light than families with more than two children. Also, she adds, family planning should not be presented as a solution to solve the problem of poverty. “Poverty is rooted in the exploitative capitalist economic system that siphons off wealth to benefit a small group of local and foreign people, instead of the people,” explained Iffah. “The root cause of poverty is not the number of residents of this country.” Although relatively few people in Indonesia would readily subscribe to the far-reaching solution proposed by HTI for some of the most urgent family planning and SRHR issues — a caliphate based on Shariah law — many of the group’s views on the underlying problems are commonly held throughout the archipelago — by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. Role of the media Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s largest socio-religious organization with tens of millions of members, has long played an important role in Indonesia’s family planning program. Apart from educating its members and disseminating religious decrees on the issue, it has also offered contraceptive services at hospitals and clinics, and information at its Islamic boarding schools, or pesantren. Badriyah Fayumi, deputy chairwoman of NU’s Family Welfare Agency (LKKNU) and a former member of the House of Representatives for the National Awakening Party (PKB), says the main challenges in the field of family planning nowadays include high rates of child marriage and divorce, and the rejection of family planning by some Islamist organizations and political parties campaigning on an Islam-inspired platform. Since the fall of Suharto and the start of democratization, the decision whether or not to use contraceptives increasingly has to be made at the individual or family level, says Badriyah, who also used to head the Indonesian Commission on Child Protection (KPAI). With the spread of conservative religious views in Indonesia in recent years, the role of progressive religious leaders is becoming more important than ever, she says, adding that positive media coverage of prominent religious figures or celebrities with large families — “five to thirteen children from one wife” — doesn’t help. Badriyah says the government, civil society and the media need to promote progressive religious views while keeping religious leaders involved at both the national and the local level. Iffah, meanwhile, also says she is concerned about the role of the media. According to the HTI spokeswoman, a strong faith needs to be implanted in individuals so that they refrain from violating Shariah law, for instance by having premarital sex or using drugs. A conducive environment needs to be created to enable people to live their lives in line with religious values and common decency, she added. “It’s not allowed to walk around in public showing your aurat,” Iffah said, referring to the parts of people’s bodies that many observant Muslims believe need to be hidden from view. “The media also have a major role to play in this, as they portray sex outside marriage and dating as an [acceptable] lifestyle, which has to be banned.” Dealing with HIV and Aids The government also needs to make sure people can make a decent living, said Iffah, so that they don’t need to resort to pornography, prostitution or drugs to earn money. At the same time, non-permanent contraceptive options should be made available to lawfully married couples, as long as they do not contain substances that Muslims are not allowed to use (such as pork products). “The goal should be to regulate pregnancies,” Iffah told the Globe. “But to limit the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids [the use of contraceptives] is not suitable and the failure rate is high.” “The spread of dangerous diseases should be prevented by putting a stop to promiscuous lifestyles and [searching for] a complete cure,” says Iffah. “The use of contraceptive devices by unmarried couples is forbidden, or haram. The fact that there are risks in engaging in sexual intercourse — such as unwanted pregnancy or the spread of disease — cannot be used as a reason to allow the use of contraception by unmarried couples. That would simply amount to promoting and facilitating promiscuity. We [therefore] reject UN programs to campaign for [making available] contraception, or family planning, to adolescents on reproductive health grounds. This can promote promiscuity, which is already rife in this country.” However, simply regulating the sale of condoms — widely available in supermarkets throughout Indonesia — is not sufficient, Iffah said. “This has to be accompanied by education, by making the [religious] ban on premarital sex part of the curriculum [in schools], by providing counseling for the people and the cultivation of a pious lifestyle in the context of the family.” As for those already living with HIV or Aids, the state needs to provide free treatment to people who were infected through blood transfusion, or women who were infected by their husband or children infected by their mother, Iffah said. HTI is less forgiving for those who contracted HIV in other ways, however. “People suffering from HIV because of a lifestyle involving sex outside marriage, LGBT or drug use, they should be punished severely based on Shariah principles,” said Iffah. “Because from an Islamic perspective, they are criminals.” Progressive understanding of Islam Indonesias National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN) is already working together with faith-based groups like Badriyah’s NU, but some experts say more is needed to overcome current problems. “Muslim religious leaders must have the courage to revise Islamic teachings,” says Musdah Mulia, a professor at the Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University (UIN) in Jakarta. “And they must have the courage to respond to contemporary issues of modern societies, such as family planning, reproductive health, gender equality and women’s empowerment.” “Islamic organizations must be at the forefront in campaigning for rational, humanist and progressive Islamic interpretation to be able to realize equal access of Muslim women to family planning programs,” says Musdah, an expert on Islam and gender issues, “and also to liberate Muslim women from ignorance, from poverty and all forms of discrimination and injustice in upholding the essence of Islam in peace and harmony.” However, it is not always a problem of clashing worldviews or religious interpretations that stands in the way of progress, says Ninuk Widyantoro, a psychologist and a co-founder of the Women’s Health Foundation (YKP) who has been advocating on womens reproductive health issues for decades. Rather, she says, religious leaders sometimes merely lack a good understanding of what sexual and reproductive health is all about — “so you have to approach them.” “I’ve never been refused by any of the pesantren,” she says, referring to Islamic boarding schools led by prominent religious leaders. “Don’t be afraid to open the dialogue. Don’t be afraid to knock on the door.” Access to safe abortion Abortion has been both common and controversial at the same time in the archipelago since before independence. More than two million Indonesian women are estimated to undergo abortions each year nowadays, mostly illegal and often under unsafe conditions. Abortion is not allowed in Indonesia except in cases of rape, fetal abnormality or when the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life. But even for women facing such harrowing circumstances, Ninuk says the legal battle is actually still being waged. “It took eight years to approve the [2009] Health Law, including a chapter on reproductive health that mentions abortion,” Ninuk told a forum discussion at the Bali family planning conference in January. “I thought the work was already finished, but then the parliamentarians — because this is a sensitive issue — they asked that just for this chapter we needed a government regulation. It took another five years to finally get the government regulation approved in 2014. Again I thought we were finished, but the last requirement is that we have a guideline for implementation of the regulation. This will likely be finalized soon.” Ninuk says that in a country like Indonesia, and especially in the cultural context of Java, one has to be very tactful when trying to build a dialogue on issues such as SRHR. “Abortion is a very sensitive issue, and it is very much related to [people’s] values. You cannot force a doctor, or a community, or leaders to accept this idea. So we have to go slowly.” Iffah, the HTI spokeswoman, said she believed abortion should not be allowed for the mere reason of a pregnancy being unwanted, unexpected or unplanned. “Indeed there is Islamic jurisprudence [fiqh] that says it [abortion] is allowed before four months or when [the embryo is] not yet given its soul [making it a human being]. But in practice we have to be very careful with this,” she said “Because most abortion requests are a consequence of sex outside marriage — it is caused by promiscuity. Don’t abuse the Islamic jurisprudence to make it easier to lead a promiscuous lifestyle. We need to close all doors that can lead to sex outside marriage.” Maria Ulfah Anshor, a commissioner at the Indonesian Commission on Child Protection (KPAI) with a background in various branches of NU, wrote her PhD dissertation on Islamic jurisprudence about abortion. All religious leaders in Islam — in the four major schools of jurisprudence, or madhhab — agree that abortion is only allowed during the period before the fetus is given its soul, Maria Ulfah explains. If the embryo has already been given its soul, that means it is a living human being and then it can no longer be harmed, except in certain emergency situations. A major issue of dispute in Islam is when exactly this happens. Some say it happens 120 days after conception, others 40 and yet others stick to periods such as eight or ten weeks — all based on varying interpretations of verses from the Koran or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, known as hadith. According to Maria Ulfah it is necessary for organizations like NU to educate people at the grassroots level about family planning and other sexual and reproductive health issues. She says a rights-based approach needs to be used that is based on language and terminology rooted in religion, to give the efforts a better chance of success. The KPAI commissioner says such an approach is supported by Islamic teachings, as the Koran gives women the right to make decisions about their own bodies, including their reproductive organs. And universal human rights, such as freedom and justice, are also part of Islam, Maria Ulfah stresses. ‘Not fighting against faith leaders’ Apart from rights-based approaches, Islam also teaches people about duty, says M. Amin Abdullah, a professor of Islamic philosophy at the Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University (UIN) in Yogyakarta. Similar to the HTI perspective, Amin says that indeed it is essential to move away from the birth control (tahdid an-nasl) perspective and to embrace family planning (tanzim an-nasl), which for instance can also be understood to include birth spacing for the well-being of both mother and child. However, stressing the need for a revitalization of Islamic thought based on a contemporary understanding of the concept of maqasid — or the purpose of the faith — Amin says one of the key responsibilities of mankind is the proper management of Earth and its natural resources. Environmental destruction, rising pollution levels and climate change, the professor says, point to the need to balance population growth, and that can only be achieved with a well-designed family planning program supported by Muslim religious leaders and a discourse rooted in Islamic thought. In this, Amin is supported by Risman Musa, a former deputy coordinating minister for peoples welfare who now works as a consultant on reproductive health issues. ""The Indonesian government cannot move without the support of the ulema,"" says Risman, referring to Islamic scholars. The government at all levels should therefore maintain solid relationships with Muslim religious leaders, he says, who can then help scale up the countrys family planning program through pre-marriage counseling, or statements at Friday sermons or other religious gatherings. ""Partnership will give people a sense of ownership and ensure acceptability and sustainability,"" Risman says. Osotimehin, the UNFPA executive director, also believes religious leaders need to be part of the picture. “There is no faith that condones death, not one. All faiths are about life. All faiths are about health. All faiths are about the goodness of people,” he says. “In many parts of the world, faith leaders do not oppose family planning — if it is used in union. When it comes to married women, they dont fight. Maybe one or two might say they dont believe in the technology, but that is only about the methodology.” “The only point where there is a bit of controversy, is about women who are not married and whether they can use contraception,” Osotimehin says. “My view is this: you need to teach them, and all young people — boys and girls — about their bodies. So they know about what is going on. So they know about prevention of pregnancy and prevention of HIV, prevention of STIs [sexually transmitted infections].” “If you do that effectively, you might prevent a lot of pregnancies, because people understand their vulnerabilities. In my sense, they should be able to access contraceptives, like condoms, but this is the way to break it up. Otherwise you get a situation where we are fighting against faith leaders, while we are not. We need to work with them, to make sure that we preserve life.”",{},"['obstacle', 'planning', 'change', 'islam', 'force', 'health', 'good', 'religious', 'family', 'islamic', 'leaders', 'indonesia', 'need', 'reproductive', 'women']","Family planning experts insist that in countries like Indonesia, there needs to be greater engagement of faith-based communities to make sure everybody’s sexual and reproductive health needs are met. Also, she adds, family planning should not be presented as a solution to solve the problem of poverty.

We [therefore] reject UN programs to campaign for [making available] contraception, or family planning, to adolescents on reproductive health grounds. “In many parts of the world, faith leaders do not oppose family planning — if it is used in union.",https://jakartaglobe.id/news/islam-family-planning-indonesia-force-good-obstacle-change/

Women's March Returns to Fight Against Gender-Based Violence,,Jakarta,2018-03-02,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Thousands of women and men will march through the streets of Indonesia’s capital to campaign against gender-based violence on Saturdays (03/03) Women’s March. The marchers are demanding the protection of the rights of women and other marginalized groups such as migrant workers, factory workers, domestic workers, indigenous people, people with HIV/AIDS, people with different gender identities and sexual orientations and people with disabilities. According to a 2017 report from the National Commission on Violence Against Womens (Komnas Perempuan), nearly 270,000 cases of violence against women – committed both in the home and in public – were reported last year. Rights group Counting Dead Women Indonesia recorded 173 women were killed last year, 95 percent of them by their husbands, fathers or partners. Komnas Perempuan commissioner Mariana Amiruddin said femicide, or murder of women on account of her gender, simply has to stop. ""Femicide happens because victims are not protected when their lives are most at risk, including in cases of domestic violence. It occurs because of the continuing strength of the patriarchy, that is, the domination of men in their power relations with women,"" Mariana said. The commissioner pointed out that the existing Domestic Violence Law (KDRT) still does not guarantee the protection of women. ""We demand that the government eradicate gender-based violence including those committed against people with different gender identities and sexual orientations at policy and legal levels,"" she said. WMJ 2018s Demands According to an official statement from the organizers of Womens March Jakarta 2018 (WMJ 2018), this year’s march will also push for the ratification of the Elimination of Sexual Violence bill that has been stuck in parliament since 2016. It will also protest against the discriminative revisions of the criminal code that contain articles outlawing ""zina,"" or adultery, and sharing of information on contraception and sexual education. WMJ 2018 organizers have come up with a total of eight demands to be delivered to the government on Saturday. The list of demands include eliminating violence against women, protecting female workers, assisting the recovery of victims of gender-based violence, eliminating discrimination and violence against women and eliminating stigma and discrimination based on gender, sexuality and health status. The marchers will also demand not only the protection of but also legal aid and compensation for survivors of gender-based violence. Pre-events A series of pre-events have also been held prior to Saturdays march. Hollaback, an online initiative to end harassment against women, held a poster-making workshop in South Jakarta on Sunday. Members of Rumah Faye, Jakarta Feminist Discussion Group, Lentera Indonesia, Do Something Indonesia and Naobun Project took part in it. Many first-time marchers joined in, turning their thoughts and experiences on the life of women in Indonesia into colorful posters. Metta Arya, a member of Rumah Faye and first-time marcher, said shes joining the march to protest violence against children in Indonesia. ""Violence against children happens every day. It causes long-term damage to children and costs us a lot as a society. It’s time for us to pay more attention to it,"" Metta said. Women’s Marches Across Indonesia Following the success of Womens March Jakarta 2017, the sequel this year will be held in several cities across Indonesia: Bali, Kupang, Pontianak, Sumba, Bandung, Lampung, Salatiga, Surabaya, Yogyakarta, Malang, Serang and Tondano. ""We initially just wanted to invite people from other cities to come to Jakarta for the Women’s March. But the responses we got were overwhelming and so we decided to organize it in 13 other cities as well,"" Women’s March 2018 deputy organizer Naila Rizki Zakiah said. Womens March Jakarta will focus on gender-based violence, and Naila said every city has the freedom to choose its own theme. ""Every city has its own unique issues. Were not going to restrict them in any way,"" Naila said. Last year, WMJ attracted 400 marchers. This year, Naila said they expect to double that number. ""Looking at the overwhelming support and enthusiasm weve been getting, 800 sounds like a reasonable number. We hope it will be a huge success.” WMJ 2018 will start from in front of the Sari Pan Pacific Hotel on Jalan Thamrin in Central Jakarta and finish at Aspiration Park in front of the State Palace.",{},"['2018', 'workers', 'violence', 'sexual', 'naila', 'returns', 'indonesia', 'fight', 'women', 'genderbased', 'jakarta', 'womens']","Thousands of women and men will march through the streets of Indonesia’s capital to campaign against gender-based violence on Saturday's (03/03) Women’s March.

Jember DPRD Apologizes for School Girl Virginity Test Statement,,Jakarta.,2015-02-10,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. The city council of Jember in East Java has distanced itself from statements made by one of its lawmakers after he said last week all school girls would be required to take a virginity test in order to graduate. Habib Isa Mahdi, a lawmaker from the People’s Conscience Party (Hanura), drew disbelief when he said that Jember Regional Legislative Council (DPRD) was drafting a regulation on “good conduct,” which includes an article installing a virginity test as a requirement for female students’ graduation. Isa said the city council thought the regulation was necessary because many secondary and high school students were engaging in pre-marital sexual activities. On Tuesday, however, the councils deputy speaker, Ayub Junaidi, apologized for the comments and said no such bylaw was being considered. ""On behalf of the Jember Consultative Council wed like to apologize to the public, especially to all women and girls across Indonesia,"" the National Awakening Party (PKB) lawmaker was quoted as saying by Kompas.com. Ayub apologized to all students and told news website Tribunnews.com there were definitely no plans to draft a bylaw. However, the deputy speaker said sex and access to pornography among students was an issue and that the DPRD was ""concerned."" ""Whats happening is that free sex exists among students and the number of HIV/AIDS infected school and college students are pretty high — this is what makes us concerned,"" Ayub said, as quoted by Kompas.com.

"Study Shows Health Improving Globally, but Progress Is Patchy",,London,2016-10-06,Jakarta Globe,"London. Globally, peoples health is improving and life expectancy is rising, but progress is far from universal with chronic diseases bringing long-term illness and causing seven out of 10 deaths, according to research published on Thursday (06/10). The Global Burden of Disease study, which shows the key drivers of ill health, disability and death in individual countries, found that by 2015, the world population had gained more than a decade of life expectancy since 1980 — rising to 69.0 years in men and 74.8 years in women. Among main contributors to this were large falls in death rates for many communicable or infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS, malaria and diarrhea. The rate of people dying from cardiovascular disease and cancers has also fallen, the study found, although at a slower pace. The study analyzed 249 causes of death, 315 diseases and injuries and 79 risk factors in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2015. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which led the study, said its results painted a picture of patchy health gains across the world, driven in part by economic development. ""Development drives, but does not determine health,"" he said in a statement as the findings were published in The Lancet medical journal. ""We see countries that have improved far faster than can be explained by income, education or fertility. And we also continue to see countries — including the United States — that are far less healthy than they should be given their resources."" As well as life expectancy, the study estimated healthy life expectancy — the number of years people can expect to live in good health. It found that while healthy life expectancy had increased in 191 of 195 countries — by 6.1 years — between 1990 and 2015, it had not risen as much as overall life expectancy, meaning people are living more years with illness and disability. Among the worlds wealthier regions, North America had the worst healthy life expectancy at birth for both men and women. Diabetes, which is often linked to people being overweight or obese, and drug use disorders — particularly with opioids and cocaine — cause a disproportionate amount of ill health and early death in the United States, the study said. Its other key global findings were: * Seven out of 10 deaths are now due to non-communicable diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes * Headaches, tooth cavities and hearing and vision loss each affect more than 1 in 10 people worldwide * There has been progress in reducing unsafe water and sanitation, but diet, obesity and drug use are an increasing threat * More than 275,000 women died in pregnancy or childbirth in 2015, most from preventable causes * And under 5 deaths have halved since 1990, but there has been slower progress on reducing newborn deaths.

Expat Rules Belie Jokowi’s Plan for Foreign Investors,,,2015-02-20,Jakarta Globe,"Two expat models show off batik creations. Under the new rules both models would have to pass an Indonesian language test before working in the country. (Antara Photo/Eric Ireng) An English degree (exactly that — no related fields need apply), a teaching certificate, five years of experience and an HIV test from your country of origin. That’s all you need to get a job with a starting salary of $1,200 a month in Indonesia. With native-language English teachers needing to fulfill a laundry list of requirements to get a work permit, commercial schools are short of teachers. “These are the most stringent conditions that are applied for English teachers in the world, hands down,” said Nina Wexler, an American who owns two schools in the city of Solo. “Out of 100 applicants, maybe five qualify. And chances are they will end up taking higher-paid jobs in other countries.” The government is still raising new barriers, including a plan to require proficiency in Indonesian from foreigners seeking employment in the country. Red tape, corruption and complicated rules that are often contradictory continue to discourage foreign investment and run counter to President Joko Widodo’s promises to simplify bureaucracy. Joko is targeting economic growth of 7 percent within three years, driven by increased infrastructure spending and non-commodity exports, both of which will require foreign investment. Southeast Asia’s largest economy ranked 114th out of 189 in the World Bank’s 2015 ease of doing business survey, almost 100 places behind Malaysia and more than 30 below Vietnam. The three compete with each other to attract foreign investment. Joko opened a “one-stop” shop for business permits last month. The center brings together representatives from 22 ministries or government agencies to reduce the time it takes to obtain permits from as much as 165 days at the moment. On a recent morning, about 30 people were waiting to see investment board representatives at the center, which looks onto a traffic-clogged eight-lane highway in Jakarta. Getting ministries to work together to speed up licenses is “not easy,” said Lestari Indah, deputy chairman of the country’s investment board and in charge of the one-stop shop. “This is a commitment from the president and the ministers, so I think the staff will obey,” she said. “We have to change habits. The target is to reduce the number of licenses.” The permit process has been “unforgiving” and expensive for Rajesh Laad, who relocated his software business from the UK to Indonesia in 2006. Originally a one-man-band, Atreus Global now employs around 50 people. “I find everything difficult here, from setting up the business, having legal documents,” he said in an interview. “You’re still unsure: Are we doing the right thing or not?” Learning Indonesian While some efforts will make it easier to do business, other ones won’t help. The government is pressing ahead with a plan to require foreigners to pass an Indonesian language test before getting a job. Such a law was needed because other countries require mostly low-skilled Indonesian migrant workers to learn local languages before they depart, Manpower Minister Hanif Dhakiri told reporters in Jakarta last Sunday. “But foreigners can come here and all they can manage in Indonesian is ‘good morning’ and ‘thank you’ and then they work for years and take up strategic positions,” said Dhakiri, whose mother was a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia for six years when he was a child. “Well, that’s not acceptable. It’s not fair.” He said he expects the law will be implemented this year. Skills shortage Countries typically place conditions on foreign workers seeking employment to protect jobs for their own citizens. The challenge for businesses in Indonesia is that they struggle to find skilled workers, said John Kurtz, president director of the Indonesian operations of consulting company A.T. Kearney. Out of 65 countries, Indonesia ranked 64th in math and science and 60th in reading among 15-year-olds assessed in 2012 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. “What the government sometimes doesn’t realize is that every employer would much rather have qualified Indonesians than hire expatriates,” said Kurtz. “For many many reasons, cost among them.” The country’s growth strategy depends on a significant increase in skilled labor, some of which will have to come from abroad given domestic supply, said Benedict Bingham, the International Monetary Fund’s representative in Indonesia. “So how are you going to close that gap?” he told reporters at a lunch event in Jakarta on Jan. 29. It won’t happen with a minister of manpower “focused strategically on limiting competition from imported skilled labor.” There are limitations on hiring foreign workers in industries ranging from banking to mining and aviation. Discussing changes Commercial language schools, which employ foreign teachers to work alongside local instructors, are among the worst affected. Indonesia is the only country in Asia that requires foreign English teachers to have an English-related degree and five years experience, according to data compiled by the country’s Association of Foreign Language Institutes. Yusuf Muhyiddin, an official overseeing private language schools at the education ministry in Jakarta, said critics of the legislation “may have a point,” but also said the ministry has to follow the regulation. The ministry is open to discussing changes to the rule with language schools, he said. English First, which operates globally and runs 66 schools across Indonesia, found only 215 instructors who were qualified out of 2,205 prospective candidates in 2014, said Juli Simatupang, the company’s director of corporate affairs. Of those only 26 joined the company, she said. Joko said investors have told him they want bureaucratic reform and ease of permits with the one-stop shop. “This will build the trust to the investors that there is a good opportunity, there is a better investment climate in Indonesia,” Joko said in an interview this month. “We must invite FDI.” Bloomberg",{},"['work', 'plan', 'language', 'belie', 'jokowis', 'business', 'workers', 'rules', 'indonesia', 'investors', 'expat', 'indonesian', 'require', 'teachers', 'foreign', 'schools']","Under the new rules both models would have to pass an Indonesian language test before working in the country.

"Kebumen District Councilor, Local Official Nabbed in KPK Sting Operation",,Jakarta,2016-10-16,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Yudhi Tri Hartanto, a councilor at Central Javas Kebumen District Regional Council, and Sigit Widodo of the Kebumen Tourism and Culture Agency were arrested in a sting operation launched by the national antigraft agency on Saturday (16/10). Both graft suspects were nabbed while receiving bribes from a middleman reportedly hired by Hartoyo, owner of education supplies company Otoda Sukses Mandiri Abadi, for several Kebumen Youth and Sports Agency projects which are set to be deliberated during a councilors meeting on local budget revisions. Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) investigators confiscated around 70 million ($5,400) in cash during the operation, believed to be just a part of the total Rp 750 million promised to councilors to approve projects worth Rp 4.8 billion. “In October, the Kebumen District Regional Representative Council passed the budget revisions for Kebumen Youth and Sports Agency which included Rp 4.8 billion procurement projects for books, learning properties and information technology and communication,” KPK deputy chairwoman Basaria Pandjaitan said a press briefing on Sunday (16/10). Four others were arrested during the operation: Kebumen administration secretary Adi Pandoyo, councilors Dian Lestari from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), Suhartono from the National Mandate Party (PAN) and middleman Salim.

Palembang-Indralaya Toll Project Is a Long-Term Investment: Joko,,"Ogan Ilir, South Sumatra.",2016-03-03,Jakarta Globe,"Ogan Ilir, South Sumatra. President Joko Widodo said on Thursday (03/03) that the economic value of the Palembang-Indralaya Toll project should be measured over the next 50-to 100 years, after the region is filled with houses and buildings. The idea is to prioritize infrastructure before other types of development to ensure better and cheaper access to the region. Speaking to reporters at the projects construction site in Ogan Ilir, South Sumatra, the president said the toll road is progressing well, despite the heavy terrains developers have had to face since the project started in July 2015. ""Only 11 kilometers [of the road has been complete], but its surrounded by marshlands,” said Joko, adding that 17 km of the 22 km toll-road will be built on marshland and only five on firm soil. The Palembang-Indralaya toll road, a branch of the Lampung-Palembang-Aceh toll project, is expected to be complete in 2017.

'Suara Hati Anak' Anti-Smoking Campagin Aims to Increase Public Awareness of Tobacco-Caused Diseases,,Jakarta.,2016-07-15,Jakarta Globe,"Suara Hati Anak (Voices of Children) is a campaign to increase public awareness of the health impacts from smoking. (Photo courtesy of Vital Strategies) Jakarta. Indonesia’s health ministry and Vital Strategies, an international organization focusing on research activities on priority public health issues, launched a campaign called “Suara Hati Anak” (Voices of Children), to increase public awareness of the impacts of smoking. In a statement to the Jakarta Globe recently, Vital Strategies said the campaign involves placing advertisement in national media from May 27 until June 10 this year, uploading campaign videos on YouTube, promoting the hashtag #SuaraTanpaRokok on social media and updating the website www.suaratanparokok.co.id. This is the fourth collaboration between Indonesia’s health ministry and the organization. “Tobacco consumption creates public health problems that will require priority assistance. Cigarettes contribute as one of the main causes of deaths in Indonesia. We can prevent this by encouraging the younger generation to give up smoking,” Health Minister Nila Moeloek said in a statement from Vital Strategies. Vital Strategies is an affiliate of The Union, an international nonprofit scientific organization based in the United States that helps low-and-middle income nations fight tuberculosis, HIV, asthma and other lung diseases through technical assistance, education and research. The gripping public service announcement video below shows a girl being forced to quit school to take care of his bedridden father: According to Vital Strategies President and Chief Executive Officer José Luis Castro, “the poorest families in Indonesia spend nearly 12 percent of their income on cigarettes. As shown in the campaign, their welfare and the kids’ future prospects will be affected if the breadwinner falls sick from smoking.” Castro cited a report from the World Economic Forum which showed smoking is one of the main factors of non-contagious diseases that could drain $4.5 trillion from the Indonesian economy from 2012 until 2030. Meanwhile, the World Health Organizations (WHO) Tobacco Atlas showed more than 217,400 people die every year in Indonesia from smoking-related diseases.",{},"['increase', 'world', 'anak', 'campaign', 'smoking', 'antismoking', 'public', 'suara', 'health', 'indonesia', 'hati', 'voices', 'vital', 'strategies', 'awareness', 'tobaccocaused', 'campagin', 'diseases']","'Suara Hati Anak' (Voices of Children) is a campaign to increase public awareness of the health impacts from smoking.

Knight Riders to the Rescue: Vietnam Vigilantes Bust Crooks,,Ho Chi Minh City,2018-06-02,Jakarta Globe,"Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnams ""street knights,"" hurtling through the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, are not your typical medieval warriors. Their stallions are scooters. They wear rubber flip-flops, not metal boots. And their shining armor is a tracksuit jacket billowing like a cape. The band of bike-riding unpaid vigilantes chases down petty criminals in Vietnams largest city and the neighboring province of Binh Duong, where residents grumble about rising crime and ineffectual policing. ""Whenever theres a call I show up,"" said one of them, Nguyen Thanh Hai, who gets 50 to 100 calls for help every day about robberies, drugs, and even kidnappings. ""Even at midnight, when I can barely keep my eyes open."" Hai, 47, keeps a notebook recording details of the roughly 4,000 criminals he has helped catch and turn over to police during 21 years as a part-time crime fighter, though he gets no monetary reward. ""You dont think about money when you do this,"" he added. He is among a group of about 30 men in Ho Chi Minh City, and 1,500 in the province, who have modified their bikes with police-like sirens and upgraded engines that can reach speeds of more than 170 kilometers per hour. Videos of their high-speed chases have gone viral on social media. One shows thieves weaving between trucks and cars along a twisting, suburban highway, with the group in hot pursuit. ""My little son gets so excited when he sees me on YouTube,"" said Pham Tan Thanh, a 31-year-old Binh Duong taxi driver who becomes a street knight in his spare time. ""He always asks me when Im going to go out again."" The men dont see themselves as heroes, they said, but they do appreciate the occasional gesture of thanks, with Southeast Asias famously pungent-smelling durian fruit being a favorite. Dangerous Work Crime is low in communist-ruled Vietnam, but petty theft and similar minor crimes are a growing problem in urban areas like Ho Chi Minh City, home to 8.6 million people. Last year, the former Saigon ranked as the third least-safe city worldwide, after Caracas and Karachi, on the Safe Cities Index of the Economist Intelligence Unit, which rates personal security in 60 cities. Some crime victims, hoping for a faster response, turn to the vigilantes before the police. ""Police have so many jobs, we just cant blame them,"" said one of them, Nguyen Viet Sin, whose father is a policeman. ""If everyone shares the effort, society will be much better."" Police in Ho Chi Minh City are underfunded and lacked training, the US government said in a report on crime and safety last year. The citys police department did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters, but some vigilantes say they work closely with officers. Barred by law from carrying weapons, many have received police training on legal issues and use martial arts for self-defense, since their work can be dangerous. Last month, two were stabbed to death in Ho Chi Minh City and three badly injured in clashes with thieves. Sin described a fight with a suspected thief who cut himself and rubbed his blood into Sins wound. After learning that the suspect had HIV, Sin worried he could have been infected. ""I wanted to quit, but after I recovered and could still see clips of robberies on social media, I hit the road again,"" he said. ""My passion didnt die."" In My Blood After the two deaths, worried families begged some of the vigilantes to stop. ""My fiancée asked me to quit, and I agreed,"" said Mai Truong Xuan Huy, a 44-year-old Vietnamese-American who works as a security guard in California. Huy, who left Vietnam in the 1990s, returns to spend his summers fighting crime with the street knights. ""I feel so proud every time I help someone, but its also very tiring,"" he said at a Binh Duong coffee shop that is an unofficial group headquarters. ""Ive been peppersprayed and had my head smashed,"" he said. ""Its very dangerous and the thieves have more weapons now. Its no fun."" His ruminations on leaving the group were interrupted by two people asking for help. Huy and his friends jumped on their bikes. ""I cant help it,"" he said as he sped off. ""Its in my blood.""

"In Indonesia, Calls for New Strategy in War on Drugs",,Jakarta.,2016-02-03,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. In 1971, US President Richard Nixon proclaimed that ""Americas public enemy number one"" was substance abuse, and that America therefore needed to wage a ""war on drugs."" More than 40 years later, the Indonesian government has declared its own war against drugs, but advocacy groups and rehabilitation service providers question the effectiveness of the policy, stressing the need for a health-based perspective instead of a punitive regime. ""This War on drugs is like a poster that they carry around with a lack of understanding of even what a war on drugs is. Its just easy to sell to the parliament, easy to sell to the public,"" says Risa Alexander, a member of the board of the Karisma Recovery Society, a nongovernmental group. ""The challenge for people who work in this area, or for anyone else who is concerned, is to campaign for drug dependency to be seen as a public health issue,"" he told the Jakarta Globe during a recent visit to his office in Jakarta. ""Somebody has to start a serious campaign to reframe the issue."" Public health approach The Karisma foundation was established in 2001 as a treatment recovery center for people with drug dependencies. Karisma also runs outreach programs and family communication groups, besides providing case management for people who are infected with HIV. It argues that the regime under which the current ""war on drugs"" is being waged — with a punitive approach — is failing. Instead, the activists suggest, a more compassionate approach to the problem is needed, an approach that highlights the drug problem as a health issue, not a criminal one. ""Basically we believe that drug dependency, or substance use dependency, is a public health issue,"" Risa says. ""It doesnt mean someone is morally bad."" Australian example Back in 2010, Risa facilitated a trip to Australia for Indonesian government officials, where they learned about successful drug rehabilitation programs. He still believes the outcome of that visit was positive but says there is a long way to go. ""The challenge is to set up a drug court in Indonesia ... but to set up a drug court means they have to come up with a new law to run the courts. To have a separate drug court, that would be quite a challenge. It would be quite a long legislative process."" Indonesian officials were, according to Risa, impressed by the effectiveness of drug courts during their visit to Sydney, the capital of New South Wales. New South Wales is home to three drug courts that commenced operations in 1999. They are specialized courts that divert offenders with drug dependency towards treatment rather than prison. These types of courts have operated in the United States since 1989 and have been trialed in the United Kingdom and Canada. The drug court of NSW is the first of its kind in Australia and has been modeled on the US drug courts. According to an Australian media report, a Sydney hospital has also adopted a model of treatment that mirrors work happening in Portugal, where drug-related harms, such as death and communicable diseases, have reduced since authorities started treating drug addiction as a health issue. ""Clearly whats happening in Australia [outside Sydney] and other countries isnt working. We spend a lot of our money and effort in policing individual users and it doesnt work as a deterrent,"" said Australian Greens Senator Richard Di Natale, as quoted on Australias ABC online last year. Criminalization doesnt work Echoing the sentiments about addressing the drug issue from a health prospective, are members of the Brotherhood of Indonesian Drug Victims (PKNI). ""Stop criminalizing drug users, because you will get nothing from criminalizing them,"" Suhendro Sugiharto, a PKNI program manager, said at his office in South Jakarta. ""I think we should be really taking into the consideration the effectiveness of these deterrents [jail before rehabilitation and the death penalty for serious drug offenses],"" he said. ""Because there is no evidence from around the globe saying a drug war ever succeeded this way."" PKNI represents a network of drug user organizations. It has 23 member organizations from 19 provinces and was established to tackle the concerns of people they perceive to be victims of failing drug policies. The brotherhood provides paralegal services and support to drug users, advocating for their right to access legal aid and appropriate health services, while raising awareness of issues faced by these people, such as enduring stigma, violence and discrimination. PKNIs goal is to decriminalize drug users at the level of law enforcement agencies, especially the police and the National Narcotics Agency (BNN), ""This isnt a war against drugs,"" said Suhendro, ""this is a war against people and in any war there are casualties."" Hard-line approach Indonesias struggle to curb drug abuse and trafficking was pushed into the international spotlight in recent years with the executions of convicted drug offenders, including two allegedly reformed Australian nationals. More recently, Comr. Gen. Budi Waseso, the new BNN chief, has made a name for himself making statements surrounding his plan of attack for Indonesias ""War against drugs"" that are widely seen as outlandish. From his dream to set up a remote prison-island for drug offenders, surrounded by ferocious crocodiles, to more extreme suggestions, such as forcing drug dealers to consume all of their confiscated merchandise, Indonesians, as well as news audiences around the world, have reacted in seemingly equal measure of amusement and horror. But Risa says there remains wide support in Indonesia for such hard-line approaches. ""Most people in Indonesia would agree that a serious crime should be punished really hard ... and often times it bothers me that we have to set really harsh ineffectual laws, to deter people from doing that again."" Karisma stays in touch with other NGOs and networks of drug users and rehabilitation facilities, as well as the local police and relevant ministries. ""Its important to maintain relationships with basically anyone, at any level,"" he said. And it is from these relationships that Risas confidence stems, as well as his hope that BNN is moving toward positive outcomes. ""When BNN officials come to people like us and many other NGOs and say: this is what were doing and would you be willing to contribute?, that gives a sense of relief,"" he said, hinting that people should look beyond the headlines when it comes to BNN and its recent initiatives. ""As much as I hate it [the current situation for drug users in Indonesia] , I do still have confidence that well get there."" On the right track? Established in 2002, BNN took on the job of coordinating relevant government agencies to formulate a national policy of drug prevention, as well as coordinate the implementation of that policy. Formulating and implementing this policy was the agencys number one task. Fourteen years later, the struggle to deliver what was promised continues. But Diah Setia Utami, BNNs deputy of rehabilitation, says its only a matter of time. ""I have a plan to coordinate [the work of ministries and institutions] to provide the grand design of the rehabilitation program in Indonesia. Hopefully next year, 2017, this grand design, or this national system, will be ready,"" she told the Globe in an interview this week. Diah, a psychiatrist who has worked with drug users, their families and their communities for 18 years, says the new national program will be rooted in empathy for drug users and include programs that are tailored to the needs of individuals. It will also try to change the mindset of law enforcers. ""We have to make a rehabilitation model, a plan for individuals, not generalized treatment plans. Its all dependent on the needs of the clients,"" she said. ""We need a national program, a national guideline, every institution, every ministry, will contribute ... especially for law enforcement, they still have the mindset that drug users are criminal."" But she warned that implementing these grand plans will take time. Risa from Karisma, meanwhile, suggested that a lack of unified understanding of the issue of drug use and dependency at relevant ministries, combined with manpower issues, was the biggest hurdle for implementing any decent drug policy in Indonesia. ""The policies are good enough, the progress is good enough, but the manpower is not fully ready and sadly enough the Indonesian criminal justice system is as bad as it gets,"" he said. ""So if you can read between the lines, it’s the whole package ... it will take a lot of work.""",{},"['work', 'national', 'rehabilitation', 'drug', 'calls', 'drugs', 'strategy', 'users', 'health', 'policy', 'war', 'risa', 'indonesia']","""This 'War on drugs' is like a poster that they carry around with a lack of understanding of even what a war on drugs is.

"Sexual Abuse Dominates the Year's Crimes Against Children, Group Says",,Jakarta.,2015-12-22,Jakarta Globe,"Womens Empowerment and Child Protection Minister Yohana Yembise pays her respects at the grave of Putri Nur Fauziah, a 9-year-old girl who was found murdered in West Jakarta earlier this year. (Antara Photo/Lucky R.) Jakarta. A child protection advocacy group has recorded nearly 3,000 reports of child abuse throughout the year, of which almost 60 percent were sexual assault and abuse cases. In a press conference at its office in East Jakarta on Tuesday, the National Commission on Child Protection (Komnas PA) said it has received 2,898 complaints this year — 59.3 percent of which were sexual abuse cases while the remaining cases were physical abuse, abandonment, illegal adoption and child trafficking. Komnas PA secretary general Samsul Ridwan said 62 percent of sexual assault cases were perpetrated by someone known to the child. “It can be the childrens own fathers, neighbors, teachers or brothers,” he said. Arist Merdeka Sirait, Komnas PA chairman, said the government and law enforcement agencies have not focused enough on solving and preventing child abuse cases. “With all these crimes happening to children, it is fitting that such cases be considered as extraordinary crimes just like corruption, terrorism and drugs. We want sexual abuse crimes be punished severely,” he said. Arist has been calling for offenders in severe child abuse cases to be sentenced to death. Sexual abuse physically harms children in the short term, but also leads to psychological wounds which take much longer to heal, he said. Children are particularly at risk as they are unable to defend themselves, particularly if assaulted by an adult family member. The group supports the governments plan to introduce chemical castration for offenders, despite criticism from other experts and activists. “Why should we care about the rights of the perpetrators? Think about the victims. We must prioritize the victims,” Arist said. This year has seen a string of high-profile cases involving children, including the June murder of 8-year-old Balinese schoolgirl Engeline and a 9-year-old girl who was found sexually assaulted and murdered in Kalideres, West Jakarta, in October.",{},"['abuse', 'children', 'dominates', 'sexual', 'crimes', 'child', 'group', 'pa', 'west', 'protection', 'jakarta', 'cases']","A child protection advocacy group has recorded nearly 3,000 reports of child abuse throughout the year, of which almost 60 percent were sexual assault and abuse cases.

"In Thai Tourist Spots, a Hidden World of Male Sex Slavery",,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",2018-06-14,Jakarta Globe,"Boys who are victims of sex trafficking learn to screen print at Urban Light, a nonprofit, in Chiang Mai, Thailand. (Reuters Photo/Urban Light) Chiang Mai, Thailand. Young boys walk in pairs late in the evening at Chiang Mais popular Tha Phae Gate, sauntering past tourists taking photos of the fort as locals hawk souvenirs. No one would connect the boys to the older, white men – and a pair of Chinese 40-somethings – seated under a tree, or to the young man with the mobile phone leaning on a parked motorbike. But for Alezandra Russell, founder of nonprofit Urban Light, this scene – which unfolds every evening in one of the countrys most popular tourist stops – sums up everything that is wrong with Thailands approach to trafficking and slavery. ""The dialogue in Thailand – and around the world – is focused on women and girls, because the general perception is that boys are big and strong, and that they can take care of themselves,"" said Russell, pointing out the deals being done. The boys, aged from 14 to 24, walk in pairs for greater safety, making eye contact with the men, who then communicate their choices to the man with the mobile phone. Once the deal is done, the boys move to a side alley to wait for their clients. If no one passes muster, the men head to one of dozens of bars and karaoke lounges that offer boys for sex. The rates range from 2,000 baht ($62) for an hour to 5,000 baht for longer, in a back room or in the clients hotel, Russell said. ""Why does this not shock and enrage people as much as it does when its girls?"" said Russell, whose drop-in center is for boys in Chiang Mais sex industry. ""They are no less vulnerable and abused than girls who are trafficked into sex work. Yet it is much more hidden, so theres much less sympathy, and far fewer resources for boys,"" she said. Soapy Massage Thailand is a source, transit, and destination country for children trafficked for sexual exploitation. Thailand has more than 123,530 sex workers, according to a 2014 Unaids report. Of these, at least 40 percent are under 18, and a significant number are boys, according to rights groups. Children are trafficked into Thailand from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. Victims from Bangladesh, Pakistan, North Korea and China also transit through Thailand en route to the United States, Western Europe and Russia, activists say. ""We are aware that there are boys also in the sex trade,"" said Krittat Uamson, deputy director of the Justice Ministrys human trafficking division in Bangkok. ""But the majority of sex workers is girls and women, so our main focus is women."" Globally, as many as 2 million children are sexually exploited annually, according to the United Nations childrens agency Unicef. A significant number are boys, campaigners say. Boys in poorer countries are particularly vulnerable, as they are often forced to work to support their families, and end up being lured to popular tourist spots. Thailands sandy beaches, gilded Buddhist temples and popular cuisine drew a record 35 million visitors in 2017, with that number expected to rise to nearly 38 million this year, according to government data. Although prostitution is illegal, it is tolerated. Go-go bars, karaoke lounges and parlors offering ""soapy massages"" – bubble baths that usually end with sex – can be found in most cities and beach towns such as Phuket and Pattaya. Agents prey on boys at bus stations, or go to villages to recruit them. The boys quickly run up debts with bar owners for clothes, drugs and money sent to their families, forcing them to remain in the bars, Russell said. Stigma Violence and abuse are common, as is substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections including HIV and AIDS, according to a 2013 study on boys in Chiang Mais sex industry. The boys also display self-harming and suicidal tendencies, said Russell, who pawned her engagement and wedding rings to set up Urban Light. ""They are exposed to so much abuse and violence: I have seen boys come in who cannot even sit down. No 15-year-old should go through that,"" she said. ""But we shouldnt focus just on getting boys off the street. We have to involve the families, the communities that are putting them at risk, and talk about child rights, and safe migration,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. A 2016 Global Slavery Index, compiled by the Walk Free Foundation, estimates that 425,500 people live in conditions of modern slavery – including sexual slavery – in Thailand. To clean up the countrys image, the government recently partnered with airlines and charities to warn visitors about trafficking, urging them to report suspected cases. It also runs vocational training for at-risk young people, and operates 24-hour hotlines, Krittat said. But most of these efforts are focused on girls and women, leaving boys and young men vulnerable, activists say. ""There is greater stigma around sexual abuse of boys in some cultures, including in Thailand,"" said Damian Kean at Ecpat International, a network of nonprofits working to end sexual exploitation of children. ""Anecdotal evidence shows its under-reported to a far greater degree than sexual abuse of girls. And the offenders are not just Western tourists, but are just as likely to be locals and other Asian men,"" he said. Children worldwide are more likely to be preyed upon by residents of their own homeland than foreign tourists seeking illicit sex, anti-trafficking experts say. Tuk-Tuk Last year, Urban Light worked with more than 1,000 boys in Chiang Mai, which Russell said was a record. Poverty drives thousands in rural Thailand and from neighboring countries to the bustling capital of Bangkok, too. Boys and so-called ""ladyboys,"" or transgender women, are trafficked to the city, lured by promises of jobs in restaurants, then forced into sex work. There are at least 10,000 ladyboys working in Bangkoks sex industry, said Celeste McGee, founder of Dton Naam, a charity that focuses on boys and transgender women. ""There is more stigma around transgender women than even homosexual men,"" McGee said. ""They are exposed to a lot of violence and abuse from clients, and need different interventions for rehabilitation."" Urban Light and Dton Naam offer counseling, vocational guidance, funds to complete school, and job opportunities. In Chiang Mai, many drive tuk-tuks with the help of loans or grants, Russell said. One of them, who goes by the name Joe, entered the trade when he was 15 years old, and worked for seven years, contracting HIV along the way. Today, he drives a tuk-tuk, his girlfriend sometimes accompanying him, with an Urban Light sticker that says, ""Boys cannot be baht,"" displayed prominently on the vehicle. ""I like this job, and being my own master,"" he said. ""This makes me feel happy, confident.""

On one side, there are those who say that e-cigarettes just increase nicotine intake as they are readily available to the general public. A person who vapes is more likely to consume larger amounts of nicotine as it is sourced from two sides: e-cigarettes and regular tobacco cigarettes. Hence, e-cigarettes do not help people quit smoking, but on the contrary, encourage them to increase nicotine consumption and feed their addiction. On the other side of the debate is the belief that nicotine addiction is a habit that can be kicked through the use of e-cigarettes. Vaping and e-cigarettes are nicotine replacement therapies that can help in reducing or even eliminating tobacco smoking habit entirely. Smokers are not idiots, they know the dangerous effects of smoking on their health and to others. However, nicotine is a substance that they need or perceive to want, because it keeps alertness levels high, relaxes and stimulates the body and creates pleasure. E-cigarettes satisfy these cravings from delivery of nicotine to the physical activity of holding something in the hands. However, it should be noted that e-cigarettes and vaping alone will not eliminate tobacco smoking for good. An important factor that plays a significant role is willpower. Thus, tobacco smokers should want to get rid of the habit as without it, no amount of nicotine replacement therapies will help without the voluntary desire and willpower to abandon the vice completely. Another vital component when giving up smoking is social, family or group support to make the smooth transition from smoking a pack of cigarettes a day to reducing it to half and eventually, zero intake. When withdrawal symptoms kick in, it is imperative that social support is in place to help the user get through a difficult and often traumatic experience of quitting. To conclude, the use of e-cigarettes as an effective smoke cessation tool should not be discounted. It is less harmful to smokers, others and the environment. If combined with the burning desire/willpower to quit and proper support, it has a tremendous potential to help tobacco smokers quit for good and in the process save lives as well as reduce burden on the health-care system.

Little Change as PDI-P Continues the Megawati Show for Another Five Years,,,2015-04-10,Jakarta Globe,"A woman walks past a PDI-P mural. Major political parties endorsements may decide the outcome of the Jakarta governor race next year, experts believe. (Antara Photo/Rudi Mulya) [This story was first published at 5:50 p.m. on Friday, April 10.] Denpasar. Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri has unveiled a new party hierarchy stacked with two of her children and several loyalists, flouting a call by President Joko Widodo, a party member, for members of his cabinet not to hold top party posts. Megawati, who has chaired the party known as the PDI-P since its inception in 1998, said at the party’s national congress in Bali on Fridaythat her daughter, Puan Maharani, would retain her position as head of political and security affairs. Puan is also the chief welfare minister in Joko’s cabinet, and the president has made clear he wants none of his cabinet members to lose their focus to party-related affairs. But Megawati played down the possibility of the party role interfering with Puan’s job as a minister, saying “she will only play an inactive role.” She did not say why the politics post was not given to a party member who could dedicate their full time and attention to it. Megawati also named one of her two sons, Prananda Prabowo, as head of the party’s “creative economy” division. The PDI-P remains the only one of the major political parties in Indonesia without a deputy chairperson. The number two post is that of secretary general, which Megawati has awarded to longtime loyalist Hasto Kristiyanto Hasto previously served as an adviser to Joko in the transition last year from the administration of then-president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, but has since been critical of the president’s decision to withdraw the nomination of Budi Gunawan, another close Megawati aide, as police chief. Another new, high-profile appointee to the party’s executive board is Djarot Saiful Hidayat, the deputy governor of Jakarta, who becomes the head of the PDI-P’s membership and organization division. Among the most controversial appointments is that of Olly Dondokambey as the PDI-P treasurer. Olly has been questioned several times in the past by investigators from the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in connection with bid-rigging in the awarding of a Rp 2.5 trillion ($193.5 million) project to build a sports training center, though he has yet to be charged. Another is former maritime minister Rokhmin Dahuri, who was jailed from 2007 to 2009 in another corruption case investigated by the KPK. Rokhmin is now in charge of maritime affairs for the PDI-P, which holds the record for the most members of any party jailed by the KPK. Megawati also appointed Ribka Tjiptaning, a former legislator widely condemned for her insensitive remarks about people living with HIV/AIDS, as head of the party’s social and disaster mitigation division. Observers had long predicted a party executive board that catered primarily to Megawati’s interests despite growing calls from inside and outside the PDI-P for a shake-up of the old order. A poll of 200 political analysts released last month showed that most believed Megawati and her children should no longer lead the party. Megawati, Prananda and Puan were ranked seventh, eighth and ninth in the Poltracking Institute survey’s list of nine possible PDI-P members to chair the party. Absent from Megawati’s newly announced party structure were the poll’s favorites, including Joko, who topped the list. Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo and veteran politician Pramono Anung, who came second and third respectively in the Poltracking survey, were also absent from the new board. Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia’s founding president Sukarno, has chaired the party since she founded it at the start of Indonesia’s reform era, following the fall of former strongman Suharto’s New Order regime in 1998. She is currently the longest-reigning leader of a political party in Indonesia. Her re-election this week as chairwoman for another five years was done through consensus without any voting or even a cursory evaluation of the party’s performance during her previous five-year term. Megawti had no qualms, though, demanding a strong performance from her new party executives. She called on all of them to work hard to improve the party and said she would continuously monitor their work. “If in the next six months they haven’t done anything of what the party has instructed, then the party will question them,” he said. “This must be an important note.”",{},"['head', 'change', 'megawati', 'president', 'continues', 'members', 'joko', 'pdip', 'political', 'partys', 'little', 'party', 'minister']","Megawati also named one of her two sons, Prananda Prabowo, as head of the party’s “creative economy” division.

AirNav Indonesia Purchases Five New Radars,,Jakarta,2016-10-24,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. State-owned navigation service operator Airnav Indonesia purchased five new radars worth Rp 146 billion ($11.2 million) from Spanish technology firm Indra to modernize navigation equipment in four airports across the country, including Soekarno Hatta Airport. Lukman F. Laisa, technical director at AirNav Indonesia, said the purchase will renew outdated navigation equipment used at airports around the country. Equipment at Soekarno Hatta Airport will be retired after 32 years of use, while 18 year old equipment will be replaced at Yogyakartas Adi Sujipto Airport and Pekanbarus Sultan Syarif Kasim II will replace 35 year old equipment. “The ideal age of radar is 15 years, so we will renew the radars in those three cities. In 2015, the average age of AirNav Indonesias operated radars was 11.5 years. With this purchase, the average will stand at 9.5 years,” Lukman said in a statement on Sunday (23/10). Soekarno-Hatta will get two new radars worth Rp 75 billion and Adi Sutjipto will boast a radar worth Rp 24 billion, Sultan Syarif Kasim II airport will install a Rp 22 billion radar and Padangs Minangkabau airport will install a radar worth Rp 25 billion, said Lukman. The purchased radars are Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) type ASR-12 and Mono Pulse Secondary Surveillance Radar (MSSR). Lukman said four of the five new radars will be available for operation this year, while another radar for Minangkabau Airport will begin operating in the first half of next year, adding it will upgrade countrys navigation reach in the Indian Ocean. He said the purchase was part of around Rp 2.2 trillion AirNavs investment in renewing navigation equipment allocated for this year. AirNav will also renew all of its flight navigation system across Indonesia.",{},"['navigation', 'rp', 'purchases', 'airnav', 'equipment', 'renew', 'radars', 'worth', 'billion', 'airport', 'indonesia', 'radar']","State-owned navigation service operator Airnav Indonesia purchased five new radars worth Rp 146 billion ($11.2 million) from Spanish technology firm Indra to modernize navigation equipment in four airports across the country, including Soekarno Hatta Airport.

"If You Can't Go to Clinic, It Will Come to You",,Jakarta.,2018-04-08,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Senen sub-district in Central Jakarta has introduced Hibiscus, a mobile service to improve access to health care.

The Hibiscus car was an old ambulance, which after some major tuning got equipped with sophisticated medical tools that made it become a mobile clinic. It now serves a community of more than 100,000. Widyaningsih, a midwife and Hibiscus field coordinator, said many people avoid health centers because they are embarrassed, not only of being ill, but also of not having enough money to pay for the most basic medical help.

'Superbug' Scourge Spreads as US Fails to Track Rising Human Toll,,Richmond,2016-09-09,Jakarta Globe,"Richmond. Josiah Cooper-Pope, born 15 weeks premature, did fine in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first 10 days of his life. Then, suddenly, his tiny body started to swell. Overnight, he grew so distended that his skin split. His mother, Shala Bowser, said nurses at Chippenham Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, told her that Josiah had an infection and that she should prepare for the worst. On Sept. 2, 2010, she was allowed to hold him for the first and last time as he took his final breath. He was 17 days old. What no one at the hospital told Bowser was that her newborn was the fourth baby in the neonatal unit to catch the same infection, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, better-known as MRSA. It would sicken eight more, records show - nearly every baby in the unit - before the outbreak had run its course. The shock of her sons death came back to her when, after being contacted by Reuters earlier this year about the outbreak, Bowser went to Virginias Division of Vital Records to get a copy of Josiahs death certificate. The cause of death: ""Sepsis due to (or as a consequence of): Prematurity."" Sepsis is a complication of infection, but there was no mention of MRSA. ""My heart hurts,"" Bowser said, sobbing. ""I saw what this did to him. And then they just threw a bunch of words on the death certificate."" According to their death certificates, Emma Grace Breaux died at age 3 from complications of the flu; Joshua Nahum died at age 27 from complications related to a skydiving accident; and Dan Greulich succumbed to cardiac arrhythmia at age 64 after a combined kidney and liver transplant. In each case - and in others Reuters found - death resulted from a drug-resistant bacterial infection contracted while the patients were receiving hospital care, medical records show. Their death certificates omit any mention of the infections. Fifteen years after the US government declared antibiotic-resistant infections to be a grave threat to public health, a Reuters investigation has found that infection-related deaths are going uncounted, hindering the nations ability to fight a scourge that exacts a significant human and financial toll. ""YOU NEED TO KNOW"" Even when recorded, tens of thousands of deaths from drug-resistant infections - as well as many more infections that sicken but dont kill people - go uncounted because federal and state agencies are doing a poor job of tracking them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the go-to national public health monitor, and state health departments lack the political, legal and financial wherewithal to impose rigorous surveillance. As a result, they miss people like Natalie Silva of El Paso, Texas, who contracted a MRSA (pronounced MER-suh) infection after giving birth. She died from infection-related complications nearly a year later, at age 23. Silvas sisters fought a successful battle to get the hospital to cite MRSA on her death certificate. Still, her death went uncounted: The Texas health department doesnt track deaths like hers from antibiotic-resistant infections, and neither does the CDC. As America learned in the battle against HIV/AIDS, beating back a dangerous infectious disease requires an accurate count that shows where and when infections and deaths are occurring and who is most at risk. Doing so allows public health agencies to quickly allocate money and manpower where they are needed. But the United States hasnt taken the basic steps needed to track drug-resistant infections. ""You need to know how many people are dying of a disease,"" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, a Washington-based health policy research organization. ""For better or worse, thats an indicator of how serious it is."" Drug-resistant infections are left off death certificates for several reasons. Doctors and other clinicians get little training in how to fill out the forms. Some dont want to wait the several days it can take for laboratory confirmation of an infection. And an infections role in a patients death may be obscured by other serious medical conditions. Theres also a powerful incentive not to mention a hospital-acquired infection: Counting deaths is tantamount to documenting your own failures. By acknowledging such infections, hospitals and medical professionals risk potentially costly legal liability, loss of insurance reimbursements and public-relations damage. Doctors and other clinicians also may simply not understand the importance of recording the infections. Sandy Tarant, the doctor who signed Josiah Cooper-Popes death certificate, told Reuters that he thought ""it didnt matter"" whether he cited a MRSA infection. Legally, hes right. Most states dont require doctors to specify whether MRSA was a factor in a death. Washington and Illinois are exceptions. State laws govern how death certificates are filled out. Most use a model law that mandates financial penalties for anyone who deliberately makes a false statement on the document, said Patricia Potrzebowski, director of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems. The penalties are often small and rarely enforced, she said. ""AN IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING"" Not even the CDC has a good handle on the extent of the problem. The agency estimates that about 23,000 people die each year from 17 types of antibiotic-resistant infections and that an additional 15,000 die from Clostridium difficile, a pathogen linked to long-term antibiotic use. The numbers are regularly cited in news reports and scholarly papers, but they are mostly guesswork. Reuters analyzed the agencys math and found that the estimates are based on few actual reported deaths from a drug-resistant infection. The agency leaned heavily on small samplings of infections and deaths collected from no more than 10 states in a single year, 2011. Most didnt include populous areas such as Florida, Texas, New York City and Southern California. From those small samples, the CDC then extrapolated most of its national estimates, introducing so much statistical uncertainty into the numbers as to render them useless for the purposes of fighting a persistent public health crisis. Describing the estimates to Reuters, even CDC officials used words like ""jerry-rig,"" ""ballpark figure"" and ""a searchlight in the dark attempt."" Michael Craig, the CDCs senior adviser for antibiotic resistance coordination and strategy, said the agency, pressured by Congress and the media to produce ""the big number,"" settled on ""an impressionist painting rather than something that is much more technical."" In a statement emailed to Reuters, CDC officials said they released the 2013 estimates report ""despite its limitations because of our profound concern about the seriousness of the threat."" The agency said it is working on improving its estimates. The numbers of uncounted deaths from drug-resistant infections ""speak to what can happen when we dont allocate the necessary resources to bolster  our public health safety network,"" said Senator Sherrod Brown. ""When we see discrepancies in reporting, are unable to finance a workforce to monitor infections, and cant even soundly estimate the number of Americans that die from [antibiotic-resistant infections] each year, we know we have a problem."" The Ohio Democrat recently introduced a bill that would require the CDC to collect more and better data on superbug infections and death rates. In the absence of a unified national surveillance system, the onus of monitoring drug-resistant infections and related deaths falls on the states. A Reuters survey of the health departments of all 50 states and the District of Columbia found wide variations in how they track seven leading ""superbug"" infections - if they do so at all. Only 17 states require notification of C. difficile infections, for example, while just 26 states and Washington, D.C., do the same for MRSA. Fewer than half require notification of infections by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a family of pathogens that the CDC has deemed an ""urgent threat."" CRE gained notoriety when more than 200 people were sickened through contaminated medical scopes in hospitals from 2012 to 2015. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia - an area comprising 3 of every 5 Americans - said they do not regularly track deaths due to antibiotic-resistant infections. In contrast, all 50 states require reporting of deaths from AIDS. Deaths from hepatitis C and tuberculosis are also closely tracked. ""GROSSLY UNDER-REPORTED"" States that said they do track deaths generally do so for only a few types of drug-resistant infections and not consistently. In the survey, they reported a combined total of about 3,300 deaths from 2003 to 2014. Thats a tiny fraction of the actual toll: A Reuters analysis of death certificates found that nationwide, drug-resistant infections were mentioned as contributing to or causing the deaths of more than 180,000 people during the same period. To conduct the analysis, Reuters worked with the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics Division of Vital Statistics to search text descriptions on death certificates to identify relevant deaths. Among the states that dont require reporting of superbug deaths is California, the nations most populous state. The Reuters analysis identified more than 20,000 deaths linked to drug-resistant infections during the 12-year period, the most of any state. A health department spokeswoman said the state legislature authorized the department to be notified of infections, but not deaths. Tennessee doesnt require notification of deaths, either. The Reuters analysis found more than 5,500 deaths linked to superbugs there, more than half of them MRSA-related. ""We know we have a problem with MRSA in Tennessee,"" said Marion Kainer, the states director of antimicrobial resistance programs. Requiring hospitals to report deaths is more than the department can take on right now, she said. ""We have a significant problem getting clinicians to report just the disease,"" she said. ""Its grossly under-reported."" The totals from the Reuters analysis also indicate that the problem is getting worse nationwide, as the number of deaths from drug-resistant infections more than doubled from 8,600 in 2003 to about 16,700 in 2014. (Some of that increase could be the result of clinicians increased awareness of the infections.) Death certificates arent a perfect measure. They can be wrong: Cause of death often is a judgment call by clinicians, who may blame a drug-resistant infection in error. More likely, they undercount drug-resistant deaths, as cases like that of Josiah Cooper-Pope show. Just how far under is impossible to know. But there are clues: Connecticut, with a grant from the CDC, is the only state that closely monitors MRSA deaths. It logged 2,084 deaths from drug-resistant infections from 2003 to 2014, all but 10 from MRSA. Thats nearly twice the number of deaths from MRSA in the state that Reuters found in its death certificate analysis. One reason for the disparity is that the states count includes anyone who died with MRSA, even if it wasnt the cause of death, said Dr Matthew L. Cartter, Connecticuts epidemiologist. He also said death certificates may undercount MRSA deaths because the physician may cite a general infection-related condition - death due to sepsis, for example - without mentioning the actual bacteria involved, or merely describe the mechanics of death, such as organ failure or cardiac arrest. For many victims relatives interviewed by Reuters, the death certificate held special significance. They had watched an infection squeeze the life out of a loved one, often over several months and in gruesome ways. To find no official record of that on the death certificate came as a shock. It was as if the killer got away. MISLEADING DEATH CERTIFICATES Dan Greulichs medical records show that, after his transplant operation, he spent five months battling drug-resistant infections that left him so debilitated he asked to be taken off of life support. He died in June 2012. By the time of his death - due to ""cardiac arrhythmia,"" according to the death certificate - the cost of his care at UCLA Medical Center amounted to more than $5 million. ""When the doctor wouldnt count him as one of the people who die from hospital-acquired infections, I was outraged,"" said Rae Greulich, his widow. She considered suing the hospital but never did. UCLA Medical Center declined to comment. Joshua Nahums recovery from a skydiving accident on Sept. 2, 2006, was going so well at Longmont United Hospital in Colorado that he was transferred to Northern Colorado Rehabilitation Hospital a month later in preparation for going home. Within days, his temperature spiked, his condition deteriorated, and he was transferred back to Longmont. There, he was diagnosed with meningitis from Enterobacter aerogenes, a virulent drug-resistant pathogen spread almost exclusively in healthcare settings. By the time he died on Oct. 22, the swelling in his brain had made him a quadriplegic, said his father, Armando Nahum. The infection was ""the most immediate cause of his death,"" his neurosurgeon, Dr E. Lee Nelson, told Reuters. His death certificate said he died of ""Delayed Complications of Craniocerebral Injuries"" from the accident. ""I remember being dumbfounded. Are you serious?"" Nahum said. ""All I asked was that they write the truth - that Josh died of an infection."" Hospital records obtained by the family show he also contracted meningitis from a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis infection while at Longmont. Similar to MRSA, it is a potentially lethal drug-resistant bug. In an email statement, Nancy Driscoll, chief nursing officer at Longmont United, said an independent review concluded that Nahums care ""was appropriate."" She did not respond to questions about how he contracted the infections. Northern Colorado Chief Executive Officer Beth Bullard declined to discuss the case. Because Nahum died nearly two months after the accident, the cause of death was certified by the Boulder County coroners office. Dr John E. Meyer, deputy coroner at the time, signed the death certificate. He told Reuters that he did not recall the case but would not have thought to specify that the complication was an infection. ""Theres certainly no rule that I know of,"" he said. Patient safety groups petitioned the CDC in 2011 to add a question about hospital-acquired infections to its standard death certificate, which is used by many states. CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden wrote that he would consider including patient advocates in discussions the next time the agency revises its death certificate, but there were no plans to make any changes ""in the near future."" In a statement emailed to Reuters, Frieden said: ""While death certificates provide helpful information, the unfortunate reality is that they dont provide in-depth clinical information."" PROTECTIVE SECRECY Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been around nearly as long as antibiotics. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the first modern antibiotic, in 1928, saving millions of lives from infections that just a few years earlier would have been fatal. By 1940, researchers were reporting that bacteria had already developed resistance to the drug. Modern science became locked in a war of one-upmanship with the microbial world. Researchers would develop a class of drugs to replace those that were becoming ineffective, and soon enough, bacteria would begin showing resistance to the new drugs - a problem worsened by widespread overprescription of antibiotics and their overuse in farm animals. By the 1990s, drug-resistant infections had reached crisis proportions. Advances in medicine have been, paradoxically, a big reason for the worsening epidemic. More people than ever are living with weak immunity: premature infants, the elderly, and people with cancer, HIV and other illnesses that were once fatal but are now often chronic conditions. Thats also why superbugs most often occur in hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities - places where susceptible populations are concentrated. In 2001, a task force led by the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health declared antibiotic-resistant infections to be a grave public health threat and issued an action plan to tame the problem. The groups recommendations included creating a national surveillance plan and speeding development of new antibiotics. Yet not a single new class of antibiotics has been approved for medical use since 1987. Despite years of efforts to educate healthcare workers about infection control, multiple studies show that many still routinely flout even basic preventive measures, like hand-washing. While the types of bacteria showing drug resistance have multiplied, the federal government requires hospitals to report infections for only two of them, MRSA bacteremia, or blood infection, and C. difficile. It requires limited reports on the others and relies on the states to fill in the gaps. In 2014, the administration of President Barack Obama issued a new national action plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Congress followed last year with a $160 million increase in the CDCs budget to bolster research, drug development and surveillance of superbugs by the states. But as Reuters found, surveillance carried out by the states can come up against strong institutional resistance and laws that shield the healthcare industry. Under Virginia law, Chippenham Hospital should have reported its 2010 MRSA outbreak to the state Department of Health when the third baby in the neonatal intensive care unit tested positive for the bug, health department officials said. That was four days before newborn Josiah Cooper-Pope fell ill. Instead, according to Virginia Health Department records and interviews with department officials, the hospital didnt notify public health officials until nearly every baby in the unit had been infected - and then only by mail. By that time, Josiah had been dead two weeks and another baby was in critical condition with a MRSA infection. After persuading the hospital to temporarily close the unit and bringing the outbreak under control, Health Department investigators found that Chippenham hadnt taken basic steps to prevent MRSAs spread, such as training staff, scrubbing furniture and computers, and testing all infants in the nursery when the infection first surfaced. Jennifer Stanley, a spokesperson for Hospital Corp of America, which owns Chippenham, said that since the outbreak, the hospital has put in place ""aggressive infection prevention measures"" and ""intensive education and training."" Virginia took no action against the hospital for the lethal outbreak. ""HOW THE SAUSAGE IS MADE"" The state can fine hospitals for violating regulations, but ""this is not the approach [the Department of Health] typically follows,"" said Maribeth Brewster, department spokesperson. Officials prefer ""working closely"" with hospitals to correct patient safety problems, she said, and a follow-up inspection at Chippenham Hospital found no regulatory violations, so no action was warranted. In response to a Reuters public records request on the outbreak, the Health Department sent a copy of its investigation report in which the name and address of the hospital were blacked out. The same was true for 22 more superbug outbreaks in Virginia healthcare facilities since 2007 that involved more than 130 patients, including 15 who died. State law prohibits the agency from identifying the location of outbreaks. At least 27 other states have similar laws or policies in place. Disclosing the names of healthcare providers ""would serve as a significant disincentive to the timely reporting of disease outbreaks,"" said Brewster, the Virginia Health Department spokesperson. Tarant, the doctor who signed Josiahs death certificate, put it this way: ""Things like this, if dealt with appropriately, are best if kept internally. I dont think people want to see how the sausage is made."" At a conference last year, hospital infection-control specialists told CDC officials that medical staff and internal review boards sometimes blocked them from reporting infections as required by state law or by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which reduces payments to hospitals for preventable infections and high infection rates. The specialists said medical staff sometimes were discouraged from testing patients with clear signs of infection - one of several tactics they said staff used to get around reporting rules. Those complaints were detailed in a notice the CDC and CMS sent late last year to hospitals nationwide, warning them that offenders could be fined and cut off from federal funds for covering up infections they are legally required to disclose. Officials said that due to database limitations, they did not know whether any facilities had been cited for underreporting infections since the notice was issued. Acknowledging any infection caught in a hospital or other healthcare setting carries another risk: The paper trail can support a subsequent lawsuit. Emma Grace Breaux and her twin brother, Talon, fell ill from infections shortly after they were born 12 weeks premature at Lafayette General Medical Center in Lafayette, Louisiana, in 2005. Talon died at 15 days old after becoming infected by a virulent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous bacteria that easily contaminates hospital equipment. ""The day we buried him, we found out about Emmas infection,"" said Kelly Breaux, their mother. Emma had a MRSA infection. She survived, but with permanent damage to her heart, lungs and one leg. Three and a half years later, Emma was in Florida to have her leg repaired when she came down with swine flu. It was too much for her heart and lungs. After a six-week battle, she died at Miami Childrens Hospital just shy of her fourth birthday. Her death certificate blamed flu-related pneumonia. Including MRSA as a cause of death ""was not considered,"" said Dr Sharon Skaletzky, who was at Miami Childrens at the time and signed the death certificate. Talons case was clear-cut; his death certificate cited septic shock due to his hospital-acquired Pseudomonas infection as the cause of death. Emmas was more complicated. Her medical expenses alone eventually exceeded $4 million for repeated hospitalizations due to complications from her MRSA infection. The family sold their home, truck and other possessions to stay afloat while she underwent multiple operations. A Louisiana appeals court ultimately ruled that MRSA was responsible for her death and in 2013 upheld a jury award of more than $6 million in damages and medical expenses for the twins. Lafayette General Medical Center spokesperson Daryl Cetnar said no one with knowledge of the case was available. NATIONAL PRIORITIES Lack of a unified national surveillance system makes it next to impossible to count the number of drug-resistant infections, fatal or otherwise. Theoretically, deaths could be counted through the nations vital statistics. Those numbers, compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), include births, marriages, divorces and, using data culled from death certificates, information on what is killing whom. The numbers are critical in determining how money is distributed for research and public health campaigns. As examples in this article show, superbug infections are often omitted from death certificates. But even when they are recorded, NCHS cant feed that information into vital statistics: The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system the agency uses lacks mortality codes for most drug-resistant infections, though it has codes for more than 8,000 other possible causes of death. The CDC added codes for use in the United States for terrorism-related deaths a year after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It could do the same for deaths from drug-resistant infections. Officials told Reuters the CDC is instead working to incorporate the codes into the WHOs next revision of the international classification system. The revised system is expected to be completed in 2018 but not fully in use until the 2020s. There are other ways to count deaths, such as searching the text of death certificates as Reuters did in its analysis with help from the NCHS. CDC officials told Reuters they now are exploring ""how we might be able use literal text capture to get additional information on resistant infection deaths which could be useful for annual tracking."" As it stands, the CDC has the National Healthcare Safety Network. Under this surveillance program, about 5,000 hospitals and in-patient rehabilitation facilities file quarterly reports on several types of healthcare-related infections as a condition of receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments. But only two superbug infections are on the reportable list, MRSA bacteremia and C. difficile. The others are reported under only limited circumstances, such as when related to a hysterectomy or a catheter-associated urinary tract infection. The reports are typically five to seven months old by the time they are logged, and thus arent useful for real-time surveillance. And the CDC doesnt require facilities to report deaths. Determining cause of death is difficult and would entail extra training for hospital staff who fill out the forms and oversight, which the agency cant afford, according to Dr Daniel Pollock, surveillance branch chief for the CDCs Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion. CDC Director Frieden, noting that there is ""no simple way to code for drug-resistant infections"" on death certificates, said the CDC ""is supporting states efforts to respond to antibiotic resistance and help protect Americans from this threat."" Just 16 state health departments told Reuters that they tally deaths from reportable antibiotic-resistant infections. Eight others track deaths only when they are part of an outbreak. (Pennsylvania and Georgia declined to answer the survey questions.) Among states that dont track deaths is Texas, where Natalie Silva contracted MRSA in November 2012 at Hospital Corp of Americas Del Sol Medical Center in El Paso. Two days after giving birth to a healthy boy by cesarean section, her incision began gushing blood, said her sister, Crystal Silva. Back at the hospital, Natalie Silva tested positive for MRSA. Hospital staff assured Silva it was safe to continue holding and breastfeeding her week-old son, according to Crystal Silva and her other sister, Stephanie Hall. One month later, her son was in the neonatal intensive care unit battling his own MRSA infection, they said. He survived. For Silva, the next few months brought a cascade of medical complications, records show. Multiple infections led to multiple surgeries that left her paralyzed. Hall recalled spending a Friday night in September 2013 at her sisters bedside, painting Silvas fingernails metallic blue and her toenails metallic purple, optimistic that her sister would return home. Three days later, Silva died. Silvas doctors wanted to blame cardiac arrest on the death certificate, Silvas sisters said. Del Sol Medical Center declined to comment. Silvas family paid $3,000 for an autopsy that confirmed that the MRSA infection contributed to her death. Her death certificate lists cardiopulmonary arrest as the immediate cause of death, due to complications from a MRSA infection. ""She was 23 years old and healthy. We knew that MRSA played a huge role,"" said Crystal Silva. ""We had to fight for them to include it."" In September last year, Hall filed a medical malpractice and wrongful death lawsuit against Del Sol in El Paso County District Court, alleging that the hospital was responsible for Silvas MRSA infection and the fatal complications that followed. The lawsuit is seeking payment to Silvas two children for the loss of their mother, loss of her wages while she was sick, medical costs and funeral expenses. Christine Mann, spokeswoman for the Texas health department, said counting superbug deaths would require a formal statute or rule change in the state. ""We prioritize our resources and attention toward taking public health action where it is most needed,"" she said. Natalie Silvas was among about 10,000 deaths linked to antibiotic-resistant infections in Texas from 2003 to 2014, according to the Reuters analysis. Though her sisters succeeded in getting an honest reckoning on Silvas death certificate, her death by superbug was never counted.

"For West Papua, Indonesia's Entry Into MSG Stirs Up Concerns About Hidden Agenda",,,2015-07-01,Jakarta Globe,"Over 600 were arrested in the Papua rallies on Monday. (Antara Photo/Ari Bowo Sucipto) Jakarta. The admission of Indonesia into the Melanesian Spearhead Group last week has sparked concerns over the future of central government policy in the West Papua region, analysts say. “My first reaction of the inclusion of Indonesia to the MSG is that Indonesia needs to clarify its motives. Is it trying to dilute the position of the MSG over Papua? Or is it about cooperation?” said Yuyun Wahyuningrum, a senior adviser on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and human rights with the Jakarta-based Human Rights Working Group. Indonesia’s bid to join the MSG, an intergovernmental organization composed of representatives from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, as well as the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front of New Caledonia, has been interpreted as a preemptive move in halting discussion on West Papuan efforts for self-determination. “The United Liberation Movement for West Papua [ULMWP] expects that the MSG could be a platform where discussion on human rights, sovereignty issues and development concerns in the Papuan provinces could be raised,” Yuyun said. “But having Indonesia’s leverage in MSG may be a stumbling block in addressing Papuan issues on a regional platform,” Yuyun said. The ULMWP, which had also been seeking membership to the MSG, was ultimately granted observer status to the regional body. Rafendi Djamin, representative of Indonesia to the Asean Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR), believes that Indonesia’s admission into the MSG could lead to the greater involvement of Melanesian states in discussing issues relevant to human rights abuses in Papua. “The MSG needs to work with Indonesia to establish a dialogue between Papua and Jakarta that works towards a better future in terms of protecting human rights and development,” Rafendi said. Indonesia’s entrance into the MSG marks the culmination of months of heightened national interest in the Melanesian region. In March, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi embarked on back-to-back visits to Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Fiji ̶ three countries that had earlier threatened to recognize West Papua as an occupied member state of the MSG. Moreover, President Joko Widodo visited MSG member state PNG in May, calling for closer ties with the country. Human rights and development According to Rafendi, issues of human rights abuses and slow economic development within Papua remain critical in addressing tensions in the region. “The reports from last year have been very concerning, in that they’ve raised a lot of issues. The fact is that some fundamental principles and freedoms that are enjoyed in other parts of Indonesia are not enjoyed in Papua,” Rafendi said. “People are being arrested for expressing for their opinions,” Rafendi added. According to a 2015 report by Amnesty International, an estimated 60 political activists from the Papua region and Maluku province remain imprisoned by the national government. Efforts to forge a solution between the central government and dissenting political factions in West Papua have been complicated by the slow progress of development and economic growth in the region. “A lack of economic development triggers a lot of dissatisfaction among political groups in West Papua,” Rafendi said. “You have a region with huge economic potential, but a lot of work needs to be done to make sure the benefits are felt all throughout the province.” Tomi Soetjipto, communication analyst with the United Nations Development Program, notes Papua’s slow progress in development across multiple indicators. “The Papua region is rich in natural resources, but in terms of human development, it is lagging behind other provinces in Indonesia,” Tomi said on Monday. “Take a look at poverty figures in the Papua and West Papua provinces. They are the worst out of all of Indonesia’s 34 provinces.” According to data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), the percentage of poor people in Papua and West Papua stands at 31.53 and 27.14 percent respectively, distinctly higher than the national average of 11.47 percent. Meanwhile, United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) findings claim that West Papua has the highest rate of HIV infection in the country, at 15 times Indonesias national average. “When you have a population that has decent access to health, you’ll have a positive ripple effect,” said Tomi. “But if you have a population that doesn’t have access to healthcare, you’ll see a negative ripple effect, with things like high mortality rates and child deaths becoming more common.” Despite setbacks and slow progress, central government leaders must resolve to improve living standards in Papua, as a means of securing a more constructive relationship between local leaders and Jakarta. “Desire for political self-determination is strong and is fueled by the sense among Papuans that they are treated badly,” said Michael Bachelard, former Indonesia correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “Economic solutions would reduce some of that.” Policy contradiction If equitable change is to be brought to West Papua, central government officials must work towards consolidating their policies into a consistent plan of action, analysts say. Michael Bachelard cites opposition from within the president’s camp as being an obstacle in shifting policy on Papua, saying: “Jokowi is genuine about opening up, but the hardliners in his own cabinet and in the military will try to stop him.” “Jokowi will need to follow through and be firm if he wants his policy enacted properly,” Bachelard added, referring to the president by his popular nickname. Recent months have been marked by a series of contradictory statements regarding central government policy in Papua, confusing efforts to ease tensions in the region. On May 10, Joko issued a landmark statement inviting foreign correspondents to Papua, reversing years of press restrictions. “Starting from today, foreign journalists are allowed and free to come to Papua, just as they can [visit] other regions,” Joko said at a press conference in the city of Merauke. His statements regarding freedom of the press were almost immediately dismissed by Coordinating Minister for Political, Security and Legal Affairs Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno, who indicated that foreign reporters would still face considerable restrictions on their activities in the region. “We’ll allow it, on the condition that they report on what they see, not go around looking for facts that aren’t true from armed groups,” said Tedjo. Similarly, Joko’s drive to end the nation’s controversial transmigration policy in Papua has been met with opposition from within his cabinet, with Minister for Villages, Disadvantaged Regions and Transmigration Marwan Jafar instead calling for an acceleration of the program. Transmigration has long been a point of contention among indigenous populations in Papua, who allege that the program is designed to wipe out local groups. According to 2010 estimates, the ratio of non-Papuans to Papuans was 52-48, with annual growth rates of the migrant population outstripping the growth of the indigenous Papuan population by nearly tenfold. In order to contend with rising calls for independence and self-determination, Indonesia must work harder to establish an environment of transparency and accountability in the West Papua region, analysts say. Human rights observer Yuyun Wahyuningrum notes that Indonesia’s admission into the MSG could foster open communication among involved parties, saying: “I hope MSG can be a forum where the states accountability is discussed openly.” Bachelard concurred, citing a lack of transparency regarding violent conflicts in the region as a critical stumbling block for reconciliation. “There is also still brutality, such as the incident at Enarotali, that Indonesia does not fully acknowledge,” said Bachelard, who has visited Papua in his capacity as a foreign correspondent twice in the last three years. Last December, Indonesian police and armed forces were accused of opening fire on demonstrators in the city of Enarotali, killing six and wounding at least 17 others. Subsequent probes into the incident invited criticism over doubts on the credibility and impartiality of the investigation. Speaking on the possibility of renewed positive engagement between the central government and local West Papuan leaders, the AICHR’s Rafendi Djamin believes that “in general, with the new president, there is some hope.” “But it’s not clear whether this hope will be translated into action that will improve the West Papuan human rights situation within the near future,” Rafendi concluded.",{},"['hidden', 'stirs', 'indonesias', 'agenda', 'msg', 'rafendi', 'entry', 'west', 'rights', 'development', 'human', 'concerns', 'papua', 'indonesia', 'central', 'region']","The admission of Indonesia into the Melanesian Spearhead Group last week has sparked concerns over the future of central government policy in the West Papua region, analysts say.

Presidents and Billionaires Drive Battle Against Africa's Deadliest Creature,,"Arusha, Tanzania",2016-06-08,Jakarta Globe,"A doctor tests a child for malaria at the Ithani-Asheri Hospital in Arusha, Tanzania, in this June 2016 file photo. (Reuters Photo/Katy Migiro) Arusha, Tanzania. Jakaya Kikwete, the former president of Tanzania, recalled arriving at his cousins house to find the family arguing about taking their feverish teenage daughter to hospital. ""They were saying: No, no, no, its not malaria,"" he said, describing how the family had sought advice from a traditional medicine man who said a jinni, or spirit, had invaded her body. ""They said: If you take this girl to the hospital, if she gets an injection, then that jinni (spirit)... will... suck all her blood,"" Kikwete said. Ignoring their protests, he took the girl to hospital but it was too late. She died from malaria. Kikwete, who also lost his brother to malaria as a child, is committed to eradicating the disease, which killed an estimated 438,000 people globally in 2015 - making the mosquito, which transmits it, the worlds deadliest creature. He and his wife even appear in television adverts, urging Tanzanians to prepare their bednets before they sleep. ""We are looking at 2040 as the most probable date for a malaria-free Africa,"" Kikwete, who stepped down as president in November, told reporters at a recent dinner in Dar es Salaam. ""If we continue with the interventions that we have been doing here relentlessly, we should be able to get there."" THE ""E-WORD"" Global plans to eliminate malaria were abandoned in 1969 as the goal was seen as prohibitively complicated and expensive, despite success in eradicating the disease in the 1950s in parts of Europe, North America and the Caribbean. The ""e-word"" has been revived in recent years, with support from the worlds richest couple Bill and Melinda Gates and US President Barack Obama, who called malaria a ""moral outrage"". Bill Gates, who Kikwete describes as a ""good friend"", aims to eradicate malaria by 2040 and has called for a doubling of funding by 2025. His goal of permanently ending transmission of the disease between humans and mosquitoes is more ambitious than the Sustainable Development Goal of ending epidemic levels of malaria by 2030. Spending on malaria, mostly by the United States, surged to $2.7 billion in 2015 from $130 million in 2000, while death rates in Africa have fallen by 66 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The most important investment was the roll out of one billion free bednets. Some 68 percent of malaria cases prevented since 2000 were stopped by these bednets, according to a study by the University of Oxford. Money was also poured into improved diagnostic tests, better drugs, indoor spraying with insecticide and educating the public to use these tools - rather than blaming witchcraft or buying medication blindly over the counter every time they got a fever. EVERYTHING IS FREE In the Tanzanian town of Arusha, overlooked by the dormant volcano Mount Meru, donor-funded bednets and free tests and medicines have made a significant impact. In a country with a powerful faith in witchcraft and traditional medicine, health officials have worked hard to persuade people to adopt proven methods of preventing and treating the disease. ""There are very few cases of malaria nowadays,"" said Pius Dallos, the officer in charge of Kijenge Dispensary, where women sat on wooden benches, cradling their babies. ""Previously... if you didnt have money, you could die from malaria. But nowadays, everything is free."" But donors ability to maintain - and increase - funding is by no means certain given sluggish global growth and uncertainties over U.S. funding under a new administration. ""The political will to go that final mile may be hard to sustain because it will remain expensive until the end,"" Dyann Wirth, a tropical disease expert at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""Its a question of priority."" It is unlikely that Africa, which accounted for nine out of 10 of the 214 million cases of malaria in 2015, according to the WHO, could foot the bill itself. On the edge of Arusha, Africas largest bednet manufacturer, A to Z Textile Mills, has been the main source of 50 million free bednets given to Tanzanians between 2009 to 2016. Giant, noisy warehouses produce insecticide-treated fibers which are woven into round and square blue bednets. Women in green T-shirts work in fast-moving pairs, folding and cutting panels ready for stitching. Donor funding drives production of the much-needed nets, as many ordinary Tanzanians cannot afford them. ""Demand is not driven by the need (but) by the funding,"" said factory director Kalpesh Shah, sitting in front of framed photographs of visits by celebrity campaigners like Bono and Will Smith on the boardroom wall. Commercial customers account for less than one percent of sales, he said. The Gates-funded Global Fund To Fight HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria is their main buyer, followed by the US Presidents Malaria Initiative. ""The question of sustainability is on everyones mind,"" said Daniel Moore, acting mission director for the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in Tanzania. ""Right now, we are carrying the load."" RISK The failure of the global eradication program that began in the 1950s casts a shadow over the latest campaign. As mosquitoes and parasites developed resistance to insecticides and drugs in the 1960s, malaria rebounded in countries like Sri Lanka where once it had been virtually eliminated. Resistance is becoming a major problem again. But greater efforts are being made to invest in new products that will keep humans one step ahead of evolution. New tools are also required to eliminate the parasite from asymptomatic carriers - people with a few parasites in their blood who dont fall sick but can act as reservoir and spread the disease when they get bitten again by mosquitoes. As the number of malaria cases falls, it will become harder to maintain the momentum among donors, governments and ordinary people in endemic regions. ""Without the long term investment of funds and the political commitment to continue the fight, we risk wasting the entire investment,"" said Wirth. ""We are going to go back to the situation where we are losing one million children a year in Africa.""

Delivering Socio-Economic Development Through ICT,,,2015-11-25,Jakarta Globe,"Jakarta. Singapore Management University and Lippo Group will run a one-day industry leaders dialogue to discuss the future and potential of Aseans e-commerce, digital and supply chain industry at Hotel Aryaduta in Jakarta on Sept. 26, SMU president Arnoud De Meyer said in a statement on Wednesday (21/09). (GA Design) The rapid growth of the digital sector is one of the bright sparks of the Indonesian economy. From agriculture to transportation to finance and e-commerce, digitalization can raise productivity, connect the under-served and improve the lives of rural communities. Phillia Wibowo, a partner at McKinsey & Company, Indonesia spelled out the benefits and potential of the information, communications and technology (ICT) sector. She spoke to GlobeAsias Shoeb Kagda in an interview. GA: How critical is ICT and improving digital connectivity to Indonesia’s future economic and social progress? PW: In the recent McKinsey Report “Ten Ideas to maximize the socioeconomic impact of ICT in Indonesia,” we discussed findings that there is a strong link between a country’s economic competitiveness and its ICT readiness. The better a country’s ICT readiness – which includes a range of capabilities such as skills availability, affordability of ICT services, business and government usage and ICT infrastructure – the better its economic competitiveness. Analysis from the World Economic Forum shows that ICT can play a central role in improving and enhancing a nation’s social and economic development. Research by the International Telecommunications Union has also shown that for every 10% increase in broadband penetration, GDP growth can be boosted by 1.21% to 1.38%. Furthermore, a strong ICT sector not only creates jobs and skills in the ICT industry, it has a positive socioeconomic impact in spillover job creation, with every ICT job created leading to the further creation of three jobs in other economic sectors, according to research published by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM). Also, a vibrant ICT sector can contribute to more equitable social development and a more transparent and efficient public sector. From finance to farming, health and education, regional disparities and quality of life, economic growth and skills development, ICT has a crucial role to play in Indonesia’s future and a greater focus on its development could have hugely positive benefits for the country. GA: How does Indonesia compare in terms of ICT developments with its regional peers and other emerging economies? PW:Indonesia is the world’s 16th biggest economy, but it punches below its weight when it comes to ICT. Based on the Global IT Report 2014 launched at the World Economic Forum, Indonesia ranks in the middle on most key ICT metrics. For instance, Indonesia is ranked 64th out of 148 countries in terms of network readiness. We are slightly ahead of some of our neighbors, e.g. Thailand (rank 67) and Philippines (rank 78). But we still trail behind many others, e.g. Singapore is far ahead at 2nd rank. Indonesia has the opportunity and the potential to grow its ICT development to enhance socioeconomic impacts. GA: What is the scale of the economic opportunity for businesses in the new digital age? PW: While we have not yet done the specific calculation for Indonesia, as we mentioned in the report, various researches have established that for every 10% increase in broadband penetration the positive impact on GDP can reach up to 1.2-1.4%. If we look at this in terms of the 2015 real GDP, the new economic impact of a 10% increase in broadband penetration can be up to $10-12 billion or Rp140-160 trillion. In terms of job creation, one job created in the ICT sector creates another three in other sectors. Thus, the economic upside that ICTs can enable is potentially huge. GA:What are the five key industries or sectors that gain maximum benefits from ICT in the near term? What are the practical ICT implementations to drive economic impact in the country? PW:Agriculture, financial services/ banking, healthcare, manufacturing and creative industries (such as media, e-services and other digital applications). Let me provide concrete examples of how ICT can be used as a powerful tool to transform the economy by looking more closely at agriculture and financial services. Agriculture: The agriculture sector, which currently employs around 39 million Indonesians (34% of total employment) and contributes about 15% to the overall economy, can further grow and help improve the lives of farmers and their families if we successfully utilize ICTs as the examples of India, Bolivia and Sri Lanka show. For instance, in India in 2000, the agribusiness division of one of India’s conglomerates created e-Choupal, an internet-based supply-chain system. This system enables farmers to sell their crops directly to producers, without paying fees to traders or commissions to agents. The initiative has reached more than four million farmers in over 40,000 villages through 6,500 kiosks across 10 states. There is anecdotal evidence that farmers have doubled their incomes in certain parts of India because of this. The system could be extended to precision farming, where the provision of localized information can guide decisions to increase efficiency and yield. Similarly, Bolivia has a Rural Bolivia ICT program which enables farmers to have access to better agricultural information in terms of product prices and better farming practices. About 60% of farmers that participate in the program agreed that the use of ICTs has led to a positive economic effect in their lives as they now have greater access to information which in turn allows them to negotiate and get better prices for their products or adopt better farming methods. In another example, small fishermen in Sri Lanka lack access to refrigerated transportation so they end up selling their catch in the nearest market where pricing may not be the best. With the use of mobile phones, fishermen can compare fish prices in various markets and can decide to sell their catch where the prices are highest. About 40% have agreed that their incomes have gone up by as much as 10% because of this. Financial services: On the financial sector, ICTs can promote financial inclusion through access to banking services. Currently, only 20% of Indonesia’s population over the age of 14 has accounts at formal financial institutions. Experience in developing countries such as Kenya and the Philippines shows that approaches like electronic- and mobile-banking services are popular. For example, in the Philippines, both leading telecommunications companies offer financial services that allow consumers to transfer money and pay bills with a mobile phone. They have more than eight million users between them. While banking and mobile operators in Indonesia have launched mobile payments and banking products, they have yet to reach scale and broader adoption among users. Mobile operators could play an important role in increasing financial inclusion by using their networks to offer mobile money or online services such as remittances, bill payments, micro-credit, and micro-insurance. A legal framework that would allow mobile operators to use their existing networks, massive informal physical-distribution networks, and money-collection and payment systems would support the target of bringing half of the population into the formal banking system by 2018. GA: How can Indonesia accelerate the development of an ICT eco-system? PW: Putting in place a national ICT road map with clear objectives, linked to economic and social development goals, would help the government better plan for and work towards developing ICT to better support its citizens, businesses and wider economy. A priority focus on supporting the ICT industry to resolve major infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks would have a number of benefits, including improving the reach, cost and bandwidth for consumers. Resolving infrastructure and regulatory bottlenecks would also help address the digital divide between urban and rural areas, through more tailored policies and enable alternative internet technology supply models to be utilized. Establishing a ‘convergent regulator’ that can deal with the increasingly blurred lines between broadcasting, telecommunication and information technology would help increase coordination and lead to greater investment with greater innovation. This would need to be accompanied by strengthening intellectual property (IP) policies and reinforcing regulation concerning cyber-security, data security and a safe internet GA:How can ICT improve the delivery of public services? PW: ICT can potentially contribute to improving the lives of Indonesians by increasing accessibility for the people to public services (such as online registration to healthcare programs, or online IDs etc.) and by transforming the quality of education, healthcare, public safety, public transport and farming services. ICT will also create an environment of greater transparency, broadening inclusiveness for all. ICT can be utilized to bring government services online, enabling faster, transparent and more efficient access to government services such as paying taxes, registrations for business licenses, land deeds, births, etc. or getting access to public information. The quality and efficiency of public services could also be vastly improved by increasing centralization of IT governance, infrastructure, services, and procurement to minimize regional disparities. GA:Are there examples in other developing countries where ICT and digital technology have been used to dramatically improve public services? PW: In India, the Apollo hospitals worked with a leading telecommunications company to provide medical services such as basic diagnostics and check-ups through mobile devices. The project could help India offer affordable and accessible healthcare to millions of people in remote parts of the country. In South Africa, numerous mobile-health initiatives have been launched that focus on diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.They use ICT to provide treatment reminders and disclose information about diseases, among other initiatives. Requests for information about HIV/AIDS have topped one million a day, and the percentage of patients who have completed the course of treatment for tuberculosis increased from 20% to 60% during 2009. In the case of Uruguay, the country launched in 2006 the Ceibal program. The program aimed to provide a laptop for each and every child and teacher, as well as broadband in public schools, IT training for teachers and families, and create new online education tools. The program had the strong backing of the president himself, technical leadership from the LATU – Laboratório Tecnológico do Uruguai - and involvement of key stakeholders such as the country’s federation of teachers and other cultural, educational, research and innovation government agencies. The plan was launched in waves: first a micro pilot was run in small towns in the interior, then expanded to cities in the interior before rolling it out to the entire country over the course of three years. The program cost $140 million between 2007 and 2009, all which was funded by the government. By 2009, 95% of public schools had implemented the Ceibal Plan, covering 293 primary schools and 2,068 students. The plan was widely accepted by teachers and parents. A survey of school principals showed that Ceibal increased student motivation during class and homework. GA: How can ICT enable sustainable social development? PW:The ICT revolution can improve people’s lives in many ways. The most important thing, however, is to find a sustainable mechanism to deliver the social development objectives of ICT. Successful Public Private Partnership (PPP) will be one of the key here – the delivery of the social development objectives will be more sustainable if corporations are involved while at the same time reaping long-term economic benefits from the partnership. ICT players could look at this additional lens as they are calibrating their investments, as this will in turn benefit them commercially. The story was first published at GlobeAsias November edition",{},"['better', 'services', 'public', 'indonesia', 'socioeconomic', 'development', 'mobile', 'sector', 'social', 'ict', 'economic', 'delivering']","The better a country’s ICT readiness – which includes a range of capabilities such as skills availability, affordability of ICT services, business and government usage and ICT infrastructure – the better its economic competitiveness. Analysis from the World Economic Forum shows that ICT can play a central role in improving and enhancing a nation’s social and economic development. Also, a vibrant ICT sector can contribute to more equitable social development and a more transparent and efficient public sector. Indonesia has the opportunity and the potential to grow its ICT development to enhance socioeconomic impacts. The most important thing, however, is to find a sustainable mechanism to deliver the social development objectives of ICT.",https://jakartaglobe.id/business/delivering-socio-economic-development-ict/

Deafening Power Looms Muffle Desperation in India's Textile Hub,,"Surat, India",2017-04-21,Jakarta Globe,"In Indias southern state of Tamil Nadu, about 400,000 people are employed in more than 1,500 spinning mills to turn cotton into yarn, fabric and clothes. (Reuters Photo/Roli Srivastava) Surat, India. Udhiya Behera sat in a windowless room in the Indian textile hub of Surat, staring blankly at a small television as the ground shook with the noise of power looms on the floor below. For Behera, though, this was a moment of late-evening calm in a room he shares with 35 others, just off a lane crammed with frenetic, sleepless looms. ""I operate 12 power looms through the day and the sound bothers me a lot. My head hurts,"" Behera, 45, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, speaking loudly to be heard over the din that enveloped the room. ""It is quieter here."" Nearly 8 million people, mostly migrants from the eastern state of Odisha, like Behera, work on 600,000 power looms in the Western city of Surat in conditions that damage their hearing and often ruin their health. While the workers said they choose to work here due to a lack of jobs at home, campaigners also suspect that some are trafficked across India. ""The older workers become the recruiters. These are poor people hit by crop failure and cyclones and need work,"" Umi Daniel said, a migrant rights activist with Aide et Action in Odisha. The fabric they weave is durable, easy to care for and low cost, which has led to its popularity in both the Indian and international markets. India exports $6 billion worth of synthetic fabric per year. This is used worldwide – in Europe and the United States for ""wrinkle-free"" school and hotel uniforms, and by the garment hubs of Bangladesh and Vietnam in high-street fashion. Hearing Loss Textile weavers are exposed to around 102-104 decibels of sound according to a study by Indias National Institute of Occupational Health, much more than the legally permissible 90 decibels and putting them at severe risk of hearing damage. Sanjay Patel of migrant labor rights group Aajeevika Bureau said: ""Those working here for 10 to 12 years are not able to hear well. Many are unable to work beyond the age of 45, and return to their villages."" Patel said that many mill units do not fulfill basic safety guidelines such as giving out ear plugs. Most units register as shops or other establishments rather than factories, which would mandate them to limit exposure to high noise levels to eight hours and pay extra for overtime. Yet labor department and local government officials said they had not received any noise-related complaints from workers. ""We only get complaints of non-payment of wages that we settle,"" P.D. Patel said, an inspector with Surats civic body, which is responsible for checking the units. The penalties for exploitation offer little deterrent, however. Nearly 200 employers were penalized with fines between 25 and 750 rupees ($0.40 US cents and $11.60) in 2016 for violating guidelines on work hours or not giving lunch breaks, Patel said. Disease and Death Bikes, trucks, vans and cars ferrying around colorful fabrics are a common sight on Surats streets. But just a few miles from the bright, bustling markets are soot-covered buildings, surrounded by piles of rotting waste and filth, where the workers live. Poor nutrition, a lack of basic hygiene, long work hours and unsafe sexual habits have made thousands vulnerable to a cocktail of diseases – from HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis. A local government office in Surat has received more than 40 death compensation applications from families of power loom workers over the last two years. ""The deaths were recorded as natural. Those who died were in the 40-59 age group,"" an official said. Officials in Surat said most cases of tuberculosis involve migrant workers, who work on the looms until they fall ill. ""There are no deaths in the power loom units. They occur only when workers go back home,"" Gagan Sahu said, a professor at South Gujarat University and textile industry specialist. Moving Goalposts When Vipra Padhyali, 40, started work in a loom unit 25 years ago, he worked four machines and found it manageable. ""But about a decade ago, they told me if I operated more machines, I would produce more cloth and earn more money. So I agreed,"" Padhyali said, who now walks up and down all day between the 12 looms that he operates. Power loom workers here are paid less than 2 rupees for every meter of cloth they produce. They make roughly 500 to 600 rupees a day. ""When I worked on three machines, I was paid 80 paisa per meter, but when they increased my machines to six, they cut the price to 70 paisa,"" Debakar Behera said, who is also a migrant from Odisha. Debakar quit and he now drives an auto rickshaw. But most people cling to their jobs out of desperation. ""We found workers who had worked 72 hours at a stretch as they were covering for an unwell friend or a roommate,"" said Sahu. ""Workers hardly have any bargaining power – their payments, working hours and living arrangements are compromised. They are leading miserable lives."" Officials said power looms without shuttles, which generate much less noise and produce better quality fabric, are available but are unaffordable to most unit owners. Padhyali blames his work for hearing loss and constant exhaustion. ""I cannot sit as I have to ensure the thread on all the machines remains straight, that there is no fold in the fabric,"" he said. In his dim room, surrounded by images of Indian gods that he prays to daily, Behera said he longs to go home to his village healthy, find work and escape the numbing sound of this life.

"In International Youth Day Celebration, a Glimmer of Hope",,,2015-08-18,Jakarta Globe,"United Nations designated the International Youth Day in 2000 — now observed every Aug. 12 — to raise awareness of youth issues around the world. (Photo courtesy of UNFPA) Jakarta. “Youth is not part of the problem, but youth is part of the solution,” said Moudy Taopan, one of the panelists talking in the celebration of the International Youth Day last Friday afternoon. Generally defined as people between the ages of 10 and 24, youth makes up a significant one-third of Indonesia’s population. According to the National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN), the country is also projected to have the so-called “demographic bonus” within the next one to two decades. This means the number of productive-age people — mostly comprising of youth — will trump that of elderly people and children. And yet, young people is still rarely discussed, let alone involved, in the policymaking process of many governments globally. With this in mind, the United Nations designated the International Youth Day in 2000 — now observed every Aug. 12 — to raise awareness on youth issues around the world. In Jakarta, the day was commemorated in a celebration organized by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) at the @america cultural center in Pacific Place, South Jakarta. Opened with a remark by US Ambassador to Indonesia Robert Blake, the event endorses this year’s theme of “Youth Civic Engagement.” “Today is about young people,” Blake said to the audience. “Indonesia and the United States are both multi-ethnic, multi-religious democracies. What that means is that we have the opportunity to participate in a very meaningful way. We can use social media, we can get involved in political parties, we can form non-governmental organizations. We can do so many different things to have a very concrete role.” UN resident coordinator Douglas Broderick — the representative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in Indonesia — echoed Blake’s encouraging statement in his subsequent remark. “There are many success stories of youth in Indonesia for us to follow. Their voices are indispensable and they prove that hard work pays off,” Broderick said, before citing his ten tips for young people. “Go to an event, read an article or talk to an expert each month in a field or subject that you know nothing about and scares you,” he offered one piece of advice. Attended by many young people in the audience, the celebration continued with a panel discussion between youth leaders from various backgrounds. The aforementioned Moudy, for example, is a youth officer at the Indonesia Planned Parenthood Association (PKBI). She was joined by four more panelists, including Anindya Restuviani, Vania Santoso, Gigih Rezki Septianto and Vidi Aldiano. “Youth involvement and participation are very important in achieving the goals of sustainable development, but their opportunity to become involved in political, economic and social areas is still very small and often non-existent,” opened Margaretha Sitanggang from UNFPA who moderated the discussion. Responding to the theme of youth civic engagement, the discussion revolved around ideas to engage more young people in development. This was mainly based on a new issue brief published by the UNFPA Youth Advisory Panel whose several members appeared on-stage. “We think it’s good to make a brief that can illustrate the current situation of the youth in Indonesia, especially on how important it is to encourage an inclusive participation for young people,” explained Anindya who works for Save the Children International. The six-page brief gives a thorough overview on how youth as a key development stakeholder can have a meaningful participation in decision-making processes. It further explains the significance of support from the government as well as development and civil society partners in youth-related issues, such as education, youth unemployment, health and politics. “Inclusive participation will not see young people as an object or target, but as a mutual partnership in development. It also means that the participation process will also include and be accessible to young people from various backgrounds,” wrote the co-authors. Technology also plays an essential role in motivating youth activism, as explained by Vania, a youth engagement officer at UNICEF and eco-entrepreneur. “UNICEF has a global program called U-Report for young people to voice out their views. And Indonesia happens to be the first country that utilizes social media for this program,” she remarked, before asking the audience to follow @UReport_id on Twitter. Meanwhile, Moudy told an inspiring story about her initial involvement in youth activism as a 16-year-old in East Nusa Tenggara ten years ago. Concerned by the high rate of unwanted pregnancy among teenagers in the province at the time, she and friends successfully established an advocacy forum on youth and reproductive health that raised support from the local government. “Our local legislative members involved us in their policymaking process, resulting in regional regulations on HIV/AIDS and reproductive health,” she said. “Even though I live in Jakarta now, the forum still exists there. I believe youth has the capability to make change.” Later on, Gigih Rezki Septianto, who co-founded a youth organization called Charity Lights, called for young people to recognize their distinctive values to advance in today’s economy. “You have to seize the opportunities and create the opportunities for yourself,” he remarked Well-known singer Vidi Aldiano also stresses the importance of having an entrepreneurial instinct. “I started out as an entrepreneur. When I was 18 years old, still in senior high school, I founded a music label and management with a very small team,” he said. “An entrepreneur’s job is to create jobs first and foremost, and for me, it’s a noble thing to do. By becoming an entrepreneur, I can also develop my many passions,” Vidi added, saying further that he has also ventured into fashion by starting his own clothing line. In addition to the panel discussion, the event also marked the launch of Youth Booklet’s second edition. This annual UNFPA publication profiles 32 accomplished Indonesian youth leaders who make waves in three major fields: environmental sustainability, entrepreneurship and community empowerment. The impressive string of personalities featured in the book come from all walks of life, ranging from research analyst and young politician to television host and comic author. In his closing remark, UNFPA representative in Indonesia Jose Ferraris said, “It is the Youth Advisory Panel who selected the people featured in the Youth Booklet — those who have done really amazing work in economic empowerment, advocating for social equity and justice, youth health, environment and sustainable development.” Ferraris also made a statement about the post-2015 development agenda that would replace the UN Millennium Development Goals framework whose run will end this December. “This agenda is going to be a lot more youth-friendly than the MDGs. We saw at least 12 paragraphs concerning youth issues, from education to health,” he said. “It’s also a plea to young people to be much more active in terms of their participation in their communities, societies, politics, social action and advocacy.” This event has become a significant reminder of the potential of youth in tackling some of the world’s most pressing issues, particularly in the realm of development. Talking to the young audience, Ferraris concluded, “The future is right now, right here, in your hands.”",{},"['glimmer', 'international', 'unfpa', 'issues', 'health', 'day', 'hope', 'united', 'development', 'social', 'celebration', 'participation', 'indonesia', 'young', 'youth']","United Nations designated the International Youth Day in 2000 — now observed every Aug. 12 — to raise awareness of youth issues around the world. “Youth is not part of the problem, but youth is part of the solution,” said Moudy Taopan, one of the panelists talking in the celebration of the International Youth Day last Friday afternoon.
