More than 1oo, 000 historical manuscripts in the fields of culture, literature and religion, various copies of the holy Quran, as well as documents and protocols signed between Afghanistan and other neighboring countries, including four with China are in the archive, Mohammad Afsar Rahbeen, Director of Afghanistan National Archive. According to Rahbeen, photographs, newspapers, various Quran manuscripts from the Durrani period, old currency as well as both original and copies of many important documents are displayed for visitors, particularly, the treaty signed between Afghanistan and the British Empire in 1919, under which, Afghanistan was given complete independence and another important letter, written by Timur, dating the 14th century. The building interior design with its beautiful painted ceiling and carved woodwork was as praiseworthy as the archive’s contents. Regionally known, the National Archive of Afghanistan also preserves some oldest historical manuscripts like the one dating the first AD century and a holy Quran manuscript ascribed to Ottoman and Ali the third and fourth Islamic caliphs, said Rahbeen. “Among the contracts signed with China is a regionally valid agriculture scheme [Parwan Water-Supply], irrigating wide areas in the province; north of Kabul, the copy of which we received after approval by the country’s National Assembly,” the official added. Despite several decades of devastative civil war and trafficking of numerous ancient relics from Afghanistan to other world countries, the archive remained intact. “Fortunately, the National Archive of Afghanistan, is the only government-run institution that remained intact and safe from any kind of robbery and larceny, during civil conflicts.” Ordinary people, researchers and students are not more often visiting the still-war-affected country’s archive and the institution yet to have any revenue. According to the official, usually more or less than 100 people; many of them students, visit the archive on a daily basis. Mr. Rahbeen who said has never been to China, even during his tenure as Director of the Afghanistan National Archive, expected to visit Chinese museums to know which documents about his country was there. Farsi [one of Afghanistan official languages] was spoken widely in Kashgar and Tibet even some itineraries narrate Farsi songs played in the Chinese ships, highlighting the two countries cultural relations and considering one of the most valid contracts signed with China in 1969, so, both Afghan and Chinese sides need to visit each other archives to get information about both sides’ cultural documents, said Rahbeen. The National Archive of Afghanistan is housed in own century building, located on the main road in Deh Afghanan, central Kabul. The structure was originally built by Amir Abdul Rahman Khan for his son and successor Amir Habibullah in 1892.

Health sector condition which was unacceptable before and during 2001 has considerably improved during the past 18 years, but there are still problems as present hospital and medical laboratories are not responding the people’s needs; therefore, thousands of people prefer to go neighboring countries for further treatment of their diseases. Currently, increasing of various diseases incidents in Afghanistan has created problems to Afghans who are mostly suffering diseases that are easily curable in other countries and changed to somehow incurable diseases among Afghans. On the other hand, incidents of fatal diseases as cancer and HIV are increasing in the country. Thousands of people suffering such diseases have lost their life due to that the fact that they could not afford to pay for treatment of their diseases abroad Reports have shown that the people of Afghanistan spend more than $1 billion annually for health services delivery. Therefore, thousands of families due to dissatisfaction with quality of health services in Afghanistan prefer to visit Pakistan and India for treatment of their patients, showing low-quality of health services in the country. Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is among infectious curable diseases that are treated in nearly 2,355 health centers in 34 provinces of the country where thousands of people unfortunately lose their life every year due to the disease in Afghanistan. Based on WHO statistics, every year 61,000 people get infected to this curable disease in Afghanistan and almost 12,000 of them lose their life due to lack of standard health services in the country. AIDS or HIV is also among fatal diseases the incidents of which are increasing in the country. Due to lack of standard health services, incidents of the disease are increasing year by year.

MoPH stresses that in consideration to predictions the number of people suffering to cancer is increasing by 50% in ten years. Lack of sufficient budget is considered as one of key challenges facing the country’s health sector. Currently, $5 is allocated annually to each person to receive health services. The amount is very less comparing to amount allocated for each person in other countries. In order to address current problems in health sector of the country, it is needed that further budget should be allocated for improvement of health sector in the country.

Women with severe anemia requires comprehensive preventive strategies,"The 40 percent risk of maternal mortality concerning women with severe anemia during pregnancy requires comprehensive preventive strategies to be elaborated.  Recognized by the WHO as a global problem with serious consequence for mothers and their babies, anemia gives rise to complex interrelated issues affecting",Saida Ahmadi,"January 30, 2019",The Kabul Times,"The 40 percent risk of maternal mortality concerning women with severe anemia during pregnancy requires comprehensive preventive strategies to be elaborated. Recognized by the WHO as a global problem with serious consequence for mothers and their babies, anemia gives rise to complex interrelated issues affecting motherhood and childhood. The annual mortality rate for each of the 100,000-iron deficiency anemia in the 1990s was 46.8. Today anemia during pregnancy represents a global public health challenge increasingly faced by developing countries. Results Maternal anemia is associated with poor intrauterine growth and increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight rates. Consequently, it all results in higher perinatal morbidity and mortality, and higher infant mortality rates. Doubling of low birth weight and 2 to 3-fold increase in perinatal mortality rates. Anemia in pregnancy is considered as important contributor to maternal mortality or morbidity and low birth weight. The latter is likely to lead to increased infant mortality. The maximum and minimum prevalence of severe anemia affecting pregnant women is 20 and 2.7 percent. Directly or indirectly, anemia is responsible for 40 percent of maternal deaths. Methods The prevalence of anemia in South Asian countries is among the highest in the world. The WHO estimates that even among the South Asian countries India has the highest prevalence of anemia. We should emphasize that approximately half global maternal deaths due to anemia occur in South Asian countries. India contributes to about 80 percent of maternal deaths due to anemia in South Asia. It is obvious that India’s contribution to both the prevalence of anemia in pregnancy and maternal deaths due to anemia is higher than the guaranteed size of it. Conclusions Considered as the most frequent maternal complication of pregnancy, anemia has as following risk factors: – compliance to iron and folic acid supplementation. – deficiency of vitamin B12,low BMI – infection with ascariasis, infections such as malaria, HIV, and hookworm infestation -deficient dietary consumption of foods fortified with iron, -other nutritional deficiencies, respectively. – low socioeconomic conditions and high parity.

Head of the province’s information and culture directorate Mukhtar Awrang told The Kabul Times his directorate is focused on three main sections, as beside press and information affairs, youth, culture and tourism sections have also done some positive works. In term of culture, the directorate has held many book reading, poem reading, Seerat-ul-Nabi and star competitions and they followed by good results. About star competitions he said, ‘Earlier, in cooperation with Maidan Wardak information and culture and education departments, a mathematic competition was held among students. The competition was attended by 500 people including the provincial governor, heads of education and information and culture departments and a number of elites.’ He added six of the participants have been recognized as Maidan Wardak star in mathematics and 4000 afg along with certificates had been given to each winner. About book reading culture in Maidan Wardak he said, ‘Majority of Maidan Wardak people are keen to read book and we have a library in downtown, where is always open to visitors.’ He stressed to grow book reading culture, a library is expected to be built in Wardak’s Chack area, and its construction works would be completed in 1398. On women interest in book reading he said, ‘Men are eager to read books in Maidan Wardak, but women’s interest to book reading is not visible, because, the province’s information and culture department doesn’t have a separate library for them. Thus, the province’s information and culture department has planned to recruit a female in the library, so the women can freely visit the department and solve their problems.’ In term of press, he said his department had a weekly named Millie Hadaf ‘National Goal’ which publishes all events going on in that province. Besides, the province’s historical and cultural monuments need repair and the provincial MoIC department could do much in the respect as well. Maidan Wardak is a province with 46 historical monuments, among which, 22 of them have been registered in the ministry of information and culture. Awrang added we also plan to create an archive for historical relics to preserve several relics related to the past eras.

Nasibullah S., who had been living in a migrant shelter in Neubrandenburg in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, was deported along with 68 other Afghans back to Kabul last month, although the legal proceedings surrounding his asylum case were still ongoing. The 20-year-old, whose initial asylum request was rejected in April 2017, had been waiting on a decision on his appeal before an administrative court in the German town of Greifswald. According to Spiegel, Nasibullah S. has been kept in a safe place near Kabul for the past few days by the German Foreign Office. He is expected to first fly to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, where the German Embassy will issue him a valid visa for the onward journey to Germany, Spiegel said. The cost of Nasibullah S.’ return journey will be borne by Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), which has admitted to his wrongful deportation.

But we",Saida Ahmadi,"July 24, 2018",The Kabul Times,"CyArk’s work has been so significant that in April, Google partnered with the company to launch the Open Heritage project, which allows people to experience the world’s great wonders—both existing and ruined through a careful marriage of CyArk’s 3D data and a Google-powered mobile or virtual reality headset. But we can go even further. The rubble of the Buddhas has now been scanned and printed at 1:25 scale. These small model statues are being used to plan the life-size restoration of the statues through 3D printing. It is an ambitious tech project, and we may be years, if not decades, away from achieving the ultimate goal of recreating these statues. There are other organizations doing similar, inspiring work. University of Oxford, Harvard University, and Dubai’s Museum of the Future have worked together to create the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA), which distributes 3D cameras to residents in areas attacked by ISIS so that ancient buildings and artifacts could be documented before they are lost to war forever. The Million Image Database project aims to document historic and archaeological locations all around the world, using 3D photography to capture dimensions and specifications. The data is archived so that artifacts and structures can be recreated through 3D printing in case of damage. The organization aims to collect one million 3D images of these endangered historic sites, and has already captured more than half a million images, thanks to the 5,000 3D cameras that have been distributed. In a project conducted by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, historians recreated a chair owned by Marie Antoinette using molds, 3D scanning, and 3D printing. By scanning the missing parts, they were then able to reverse 3D print them. The moldings taken from the 3D printed pieces were re-casted in a non-chemical material that was then toned and gilded so that it would match the original pieces. Many of such items were stolen or destroyed following the French Revolution. With technology and innovation, powered by the rise of 3D scanning and printing, all things are possible. Quite soon, in fact, 3D printing will allow us to take these stunning digital imprints and do more than view them through the filter of a hologram or virtual reality headset. Smaller versions, printed to scale on the home 3D printers that will soon exist in households across America, will offer endless opportunities for education and cultural enrichment. But the potential is much grander, as well. In the very near future, harnessing these digital libraries and the immense bandwidth offered by a giant like Google, we will also be able to fully recreate cherished heritage sites, using not just light and shadow, but actual brick, mortar, and 3D-printed concrete. The Buddhas of Bamiyan will rise again in that lush valley, not just as a beautiful light show for one night only, but as living, tangible proof of the resilience of human creativity in the face of senseless destruction. Just imagine if we do the same for the Temple of Bel in Palmyra; the libraries at the University of Mosul; and the Armenian Genocide Memorial in Syria. It’s no longer a far-off dream. The technology is ready. With the wonders of 3D, we’ve found a new way to fight for the preservation of our cultural and spiritual monuments, powered by brainpower and the collective will of humanity.
