MAKER OF POTENTIAL HIV CURE SPEAKS UP!,"News of a ""potential HIV cure"" had many on social media in a frenzy, but the maker of the drug has moved to temper expectations, saying more trials are needed, and the process is in its infancy.",,2018/11/08,DailySun,"News of a ""potential HIV cure"" had many on social media in a frenzy, but the maker of the drug has moved to temper expectations, saying more trials are needed, and the process is in its infancy. Israeli-based pharmaceutical company, Zion Medical, which recently broke the news of a successful first clinical trial for what they called a potential HIV cure, has issued a further statement on Twitter making it clear that more trials will be needed, and their official results will need to be published and peer-reviewed. Since the company made the announcement on 31 October, there has been a wave of excitement on social media in particular, with people clamouring for more information on the ""potential cure"". According to the World Health Organisation, at the end of 2017 approximately 36.9 million people worldwide were living with HIV. In a statement at the time, Zion Medical announced the results of the first clinical trial of its HIV-drug Gammora, which, the company said, eliminated up to 99% of the HI virus within four weeks of treatment. Nine HIV-infected patients took part in ""Part I and II"" of the trial, at Dr. Ronald Bata Memorial Hospital in Entebbe, over 10 weeks. But the company has moved to temper expectations, saying on Twitter: ""We want to thank everyone for their interest in the promising results of our first clinical trial. Like you, we are hopeful that #Gammora may one day offer those affected by #HIV a viable path to ridding themselves of infection. Much work remains in this mission including additional trials, publication of results and the steps required to make #Gammora commercially available. ""We are not there yet, but we are a step closer, hopeful – and committed to keeping you informed of our progress."" The company also acknowledged that the official results should be peer-reviewed in a scientific journal, which it hopes to have done in early 2019. Lengthy process Professor Adrian Puren, Head of the HIV Surveillance and Sero-Molecular Diagnostic Section at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), told Health24 that there is a lengthy process that needs to be followed, before being bold enough to call the drug a potential cure. ""You would need to go through several stages to prove something like this. Doing the research, gathering the evidence and building up all thats required to find some potential is important. ""There are different phases that you would need to go through as well. You may need to do an animal trial, then a small human trial - the process is complex and you may need to start out really small and run several tests in order to determine that the drugs arent toxic and that there arent any harmful side effects. ""You would also need to test the efficacy of the medication at various stages, going through the different phases of trials. At some stage you would also need to run randomised tests so that you eliminate biases from the research and really make sure people arent being harmed. ""Going through something like this is not easy. It is highly complex, needs to be detailed and its quite expensive. If I were going to look into this drug, I would want to see the published literature and be able to trace everything back to the authors, knowing that everything has been reviewed. ""Once all of the research has been done, its been reviewed and it is run through all the regulatory authorities, various ethics boards, and sufficiently scrutinised, then a company will be able to make a statement like that. And when they do make announcements like this, they usually do it at big conferences,"" said Puren. The Health Departments Deputy Director General for HIV/AIDS, TB and Maternal, Child and Womens Health, Dr Yogan Pillay, added, ""As far as we are aware, there is no published clinical trials on this. ""Unless this is published in peer reviewed journals and the World Health Organisation approved this drug, we cannot take this claim seriously."" Quackery On Tuesday, a prominent SA HIV scientist slammed the ""cure"", which was widely being punted on social media, as smacking of ""quackery"". ""The HIV world has seen quackery in different forms for decades – sadly this smacks of more of it,"" Professor Francois Venter from the University of Witwatersrands Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, told Health-e News. He said that saying the drug is a potential cure with no side-effects are ""over-the-top biological claims that appear in public before the formal literature [is published] and should be viewed with deep scepticism"". ""I looked at the press report and the unsophisticated company website, and even if you believe their claims, they are many years away from testing them,"" said Venter. Zion Medical is a relatively new company, established in 2014. According to the company website, it develops AIDS and Cancer curing products based on peptides derived from HIV and targeted lentivirus particles. It lists its partners as The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mount Sinai Hospital in New York (USA), and the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, among others. All of Health24s attempts to contact Zion Medical directly for further comment have so far been unsuccessful - all forms of electronic mails have been undeliverable due to an invalid email address and all telephone calls go unanswered. - Health24",Health,"['published', 'speaks', 'trial', 'trials', 'medical', 'company', 'hiv', 'results', 'need', 'potential', 'health', 'cure', 'maker']","News of a ""potential HIV cure"" had many on social media in a frenzy, but the maker of the drug has moved to temper expectations, saying more trials are needed, and the process is in its infancy.

HIV: Life expectancy and outlook,There is no set length of time that a person can live with HIV. Life expectancy increases as new treatments become available. People can now manage HIV as a chronic condition. Learn more here.,,,Medical News Today,"The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years. Thanks to advances in treatment, namely antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV can now expect to live long, healthy lives. When the HIV and AIDS epidemic began in the United States in the 1980s, HIV was a life-threatening condition. However, people can now manage it as a chronic health condition, much like they would diabetes or heart failure. In this article, we examine developments in managing and treating HIV, as well as the long-term outlook. Recent improvements Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. The increase in life expectancy for people living with HIV has direct links to improvements in medical therapy, which includes antiretroviral medications. These medications help suppress levels of HIV in the blood and slow damage resulting from the infection. This suppression helps prevent progression from HIV to AIDS, or stage 3 HIV. In the 1980s–1990s, antiretroviral therapy began as monotherapy, then it became dual therapy. Now, there is combination antiretroviral therapy, which includes using three or more drugs. There are several classes of antiretroviral drugs that attack HIV in different ways. Combinations of drugs are the first-line treatment. People typically start antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV. A 2017 study in the journal AIDS found that the additional life expectancy for people with HIV at age 20 during the early monotherapy era was 11.8 years. However, that number rose to 54.9 years for the most recent combination antiretroviral era. Researchers also concluded that people with HIV with higher education had a similar life expectancy to the general population. Future treatment options Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Researchers continue to work on a cure for HIV. In the meantime, combination antiretroviral therapy preserves the health of a person with HIV. It does this by suppressing the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. It is important for the person to follow their therapy plan precisely. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now report that when a person taking antiretroviral therapy has a negative viral load in their blood, the risk of transmitting the virus to a person without HIV is essentially zero. This discovery takes researchers to a notion of ""treatment as prevention,"" which promotes well-controlled HIV as a way to prevent transmission through sexual contact, needle sharing, and childbirth and breastfeeding. Because people with HIV are living much longer, they are starting to face the same health issues as other older adults. In fact, differentiating Alzheimers disease from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is becoming an emerging issue in the population of older adults living with HIV. Even with the advances in antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV may experience long-term side effects of either the therapy or HIV itself. Conditions common in long-standing HIV infection include: cardiovascular disease lung disease certain cancers HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders liver disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C HIV also appears to increase chronic inflammation in the body, putting a person at risk of certain health conditions. However, more research is necessary to better understand this. Antiretroviral medications have links to both short- and long-term side effects. Most side effects are manageable but can become serious. A person should speak with their healthcare provider about side effects that are of any concern. Long-term effects from antiretrovirals can include: kidney failure liver failure heart disease type 2 diabetes high blood cholesterol levels lipodystrophy, or changes in how the body stores fat osteoporosis neuropathy Outlook A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. Life expectancy for people living with HIV has seen great improvement in recent years. In fact, a person who currently has HIV can expect to add many years to their life once they start combination antiretroviral treatment. A 2017 study in the journal HIV Medicine indicates that a person with HIV living in a high-income country would add 43.3 years to their life expectancy if they receive a diagnosis at age 20. Without adequate treatment, however, HIV can quickly start to damage cells in the immune system. It is important for a person living with HIV to stick to their treatment plan to keep the virus suppressed in the blood. It is also essential for the person to work closely with their healthcare providers on a regular basis and maintain all other aspects of their health and well-being.",,"['effects', 'expectancy', 'treatment', 'person', 'living', 'antiretroviral', 'hiv', 'health', 'therapy', 'outlook', 'life']","The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years.

HIV/AIDS - Symptoms and causes,,,,Mayo Clinic,"Overview Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your bodys ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. Theres no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. Symptoms The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if youre not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today dont develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. Youll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldnt usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: Soaking night sweats Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible. Causes HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. How does HIV become AIDS? HIV destroys CD4 T cells — white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication. How HIV spreads To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways: By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.

By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies. How HIV doesnt spread You cant become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you cant catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isnt spread through the air, water or insect bites. Risk factors When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now its clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, youre at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals.

People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other peoples blood. Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV. Complications HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Its a leading cause of death among people with AIDS.

This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.

This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain.

This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite thats commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS. Cancers common to HIV/AIDS Kaposis sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposis sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.

This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin. Other complications Wasting syndrome. Aggressive treatment approaches have reduced the number of cases of wasting syndrome, but it still affects many people with AIDS. Its defined as a loss of at least 10 percent of body weight, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever.

HIV Transmission,Some questions and answers on how HIV is transmitted.,,,,"Some groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including the status of their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live. When you live in a community where many people have HIV infection, the chances of having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV are higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis atlas to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different US communities. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different populations. Gay and bisexual men have the largest number of new diagnoses in the United States. Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Also, transgender women who have sex with men are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, and injection drug users remain at significant risk for getting HIV. Risky behaviors, like having anal or vaginal sex without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV, and sharing needles or syringes play a big role in HIV transmission. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. If you don’t have HIV, being a receptive partner (or bottom) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for getting HIV. If you do have HIV, being the insertive partner (or top) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for transmitting HIV. But there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, and using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV. Learn more about these and other strategies to prevent HIV. For more information about the risk for different groups of people, see HIV in the United States and HIV by Geographical Distribution.

SECOND PERSON ‘CURED’ OF HIV,A LONDON man appears to be free of HIV after a stem cell transplant.,,2019/03/05,DailySun,"A LONDON man appears to be free of HIV after a stem cell transplant. He is the second apparent success using this medical procedure, after the so-called ""Berlin patient"", doctors reported. The Berlin patient is Timothy Ray Brown, an American man treated in Germany, who is still free of HIV 12 years after the procedure. Until now, Brown is the only person thought to have been cured of infection with HIV, the virus that causes Aids. Such transplants are dangerous and have failed in other patients. Theyre also impractical to try to cure the millions already infected. The latest case ""shows the cure of Timothy Brown was not a one-off and can be recreated"", said Dr Keith Jerome of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He added that it could lead to a simpler approach that could be used more widely. The patient has not been identified. He was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and started taking drugs to control the infection in 2012. He developed Hodgkins lymphoma that year and agreed to a stem cell transplant to treat the cancer in 2016. His doctors believed that with the right kind of donor the London patient might not only have his cancer cured, but possibly even his HIV infection. Doctors found a donor with a gene mutation that gives natural resistance to HIV. About 1% of people descended from northern Europeans have inherited the mutation from both parents and are immune to most HIV. The transplant changed the London patients immune system, giving him the donors mutation and HIV resistance. It is too soon to tell if the “cure” will be permanent or not. https://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/News/second-man-seems-to-be-free-of-hiv-after-stem-cell-transplant-20190305",Health,"['timothy', 'mutation', 'brown', 'person', 'transplant', 'second', 'london', 'cured', 'cancer', 'hiv', 'patient', 'stem', 'cure']","A LONDON man appears to be free of HIV after a stem cell transplant.

MYTHS PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE ABOUT HIV/AIDS!,"HIV has become completely manageable, but it is surprising how many people still believe some of the misconceptions about the condition.",,2018/12/04,DailySun,"HIV has become completely manageable, but it is surprising how many people still believe some of the misconceptions about the condition. The theme of 2018 is “Know your status”, which emphasises the importance of getting tested. Here are a couple of misconceptions that need to be cleared up. Some are harsh and ignorant untruths while others are just absolute myths. 1. Only high-risk people such as homosexuals and promiscuous people should be tested for HIV. First, what defines “high risk”? Being with one long-term partner does not mean that you will never contract HIV. “HIV can happen to anyone. It’s not a disease of the promiscuous. Think about survivors of rape or someone born with HIV,” says Barbara Kingsley, an HIV activist who was diagnosed in 2000. And regardless of that, no-one should be shamed for their sexual choices and lifestyle. It’s important to know your status as symptoms may not manifest for years and people can be completely unaware that they have HIV. The earlier you know your status, the earlier you can start taking antiretrovirals (ARVs) to combat the virus and take control of your status. You will also need to know your status to reduce the risk of infecting other possible sexual partners. Regular testing will also help you raise awareness and break the stigma surrounding HIV/Aids by improving the negative attitudes and perceptions in your own family and circle of friends, even if you are with a long-term partner or not having sex at all. 2. You will get very sick and die if you are HIV positive. Yes, HIV can lead to Aids. Yes, Aids can be fatal. Does this mean that you are immediately doomed as soon as you are tested positive? Certainly not. Nowadays, HIV is well controlled through ARVs, and many HIV positive people live completely healthy, happy lives. It may take years for the immune system to deteriorate to such an extent that someone living with HIV becomes ill and is diagnosed with Aids. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV will progress to Aids if not treated with ARVs. This will usually happen after about 10 to 15 years, and before it happens, people with HIV may look and feel perfectly well and can continue life to the fullest. HIV is no longer a death sentence and the sooner you are tested, the sooner you can start the proper treatment. 3. I will never contract HIV/Aids. It’s a disease that only poor people get. This statement is so harsh that you cannot imagine anyone saying it out loud. The truth is, HIV is blind to colour or economic status. According to a paper published in the journal AIDS, stigma surrounding HIV/Aids is a big factor in the limitation of proper treatment. You as an individual might feel helpless in the face of the quest to find a cure for HIV, or to ensure that everyone has access to medicine and medical care. But what you can do is to start changing the views and perceptions of people in your immediate circle, which can have a wider effect on society. 4. He/she is very skinny. They must have HIV/Aids. Progressive Aids in its end stages can cause weight loss and an impaired immune system. Untreated HIV can lead to Aids. However, there is no way of telling someone’s status by simply looking at them. Physical signs and symptoms can take years to manifest or may never do so, especially when an HIV positive person is taking ARVs and has a healthy, active lifestyle. 5. It’s impossible to marry/have a sexual relationship if you are HIV positive. Unprotected sex is the most common way of spreading HIV. But with protection, there is no reason why an HIV positive person can’t have a fulfilling relationship with an HIV negative person. With proper treatment and management through ARVs, there is a chance that the viral load (the presence of HIV in your blood) may be undetectable. Research has shown that having an undetectable viral load can lead to little to no risk of spreading the virus to other people. However, Barbara Kingsley says that it remains important always to use protection, no matter what your viral load: ""The goal of ARVs is for the virus to eventually become undetectable. This means that if you have an undetectable viral load for a period of six months or longer you cannot pass the virus on to others. It is very important to understand that this doesnt protect you against pregnancy or any other STD, and that you can still practise irresponsible sex — you should ideally be in a monogamous, long-term relationship. An undetectable state can ONLY be achieved with ARVs, something that has been scientifically proven and internationally accepted. (It, however, doesn’t mean that you can have unprotected sex as you wish.)"" Health24 previously told the story of Quinton Jonck, a South African living with HIV. He said the following: “My wife is wonderful – I tried to break it off with her early on in our relationship because I believed we had no future. She wanted to hear nothing about that and two years later we got married. “Five years after we got married we had our first child. He was conceived using a procedure called sperm washing and insemination. When we had the next two children, I was on medication to take my viral load down to zero and we took a chance just at the right time. Now we have three children – two boys and a girl [all HIV negative]. “We are very happy and my wife is still HIV negative after almost 14 years of marriage.

Research has shown that having an undetectable viral load can lead to little to no risk of spreading the virus to other people. This means that if you have an undetectable viral load for a period of six months or longer you cannot pass the virus on to others.",https://www.dailysun.co.za/Success/Health/myths-people-still-believe-about-hivaids-20181204

HOW TO FIGHT AGAINST HIV,THE fight to find a cure for HIV/Aids is ongoing.,,2019/02/11,DailySun,"THE fight to find a cure for HIV/Aids is ongoing. But it is not just government’s duty. It is everyone’s responsibility. The public, with private health organisations and NGOs, need to promote and practise safer sex. Mo-Afrika Itlhokomele is a community-based organisation that offers education on health. They go around Pimville and neighbouring areas to talk about condom use, especially during STI/Condom Week, which starts today and ends on Friday, 15 February. Joseph Didishe, the operational manager at Mo-Afrika Itlhokomele, said: “While many people are willing to listen and talk about HIV/Aids and safer sex, many will not use condoms. “Many women complain about the new women’s condom. They say the sponge inside irritates them. “Men complain that traditional male condoms reduce the feeling of sex and pleasure of the orgasm.” Didishe said, during their outreach drive, they also visit people at home because not everyone is comfortable talking about sex in public. Places on their agenda this week include eMaganda Gandeni near Orlando East, Holomisa in Nancefield, the Nancefield Hostel and Nomzamo. They will also be in Pimville zone 9 – also known as zone 14 – where they will be doing HIV tests. “Our purpose is to reach as many people as possible in the week and convince them to practise safer sex by using condoms and having sex in a committed relationship. “Condoms are contraceptives that prevents unprepared pregnancies.” He said the staff of Mo-Afrika Itlhokomele also discuss the social issues affecting people who come to the talks so the discussion also includes topics about health and lifestyle. All the people they visit or see all the time are given free packs of condoms to use whenever needed. But Didishe said people also need to take themselves to clinics and check on their health status. “We also go to schools and talk to pupils about crime, life in general as well as sex education.” SunHealth interviewed some of the people who visited the Mo-Afrika stall: Zanele Tshabalala (33) and Irene Netshirungulu (32) said they use condoms because they don’t want to fall pregnant unexpectedly. Lindiwe Nyembe (30) said she doesn’t use condoms because she has a stable partner.

Lebogang Motsumi, an HIV positive activist and entrepreneur, recently told Daily Sun she had dedicated herself to educating young people to prevent them from making the same mistakes she did. The 29-year-old from Parktown in Joburg said she almost died before she accepted her HIV status and started leading a happy life. She said she was only 17 when she was infected by her boyfriend, a well-known singer who has since died. “We had sex without a condom because no one spoke about it. I feared pregnancy more than HIV because I thought it only affected older people,’ she said. “I thought I couldn’t have it because I was young, beautiful and chubby. I associated it with people from poor communities and thought they looked skinny with their hair falling out.” Lebogang said even after the man who infected her had told her the truth and died, she didn’t believe she could have HIV. Three years later, Lebogang met a new man and he insisted they go for an HIV test after the condom they used burst. “I started taking my medication because it was the right thing to do, but I didn’t understand the importance of it. “I later joined a church where the pastor claimed he could cure the disease and stopped taking my medication. “I got very ill and was hospitalised for six months and was bedridden,” said Lebogang.

MEN: GO SLOW AND PROTECT YOUR FUTURE,THE public face of the fight against HIV/AIDS in South Africa often centres on women – be it women going for antenatal screening or services for adolescent girls and young women.,,,,"THE public face of the fight against HIV/AIDS in South Africa often centres on women – be it women going for antenatal screening or services for adolescent girls and young women. But what about boys and young men? They are also affected and have a big role to play in changing attitudes about stigma and protecting themselves and others. HIV prevalence is almost 12,2% in KZN – and men must be an integral part of this battle against the virus. Studies show that just over half of our youth properly understand how to protect themselves from HIV, and very few schools offer education about sexuality, boundaries and consent. Violence, inequality between men and women and HIV are creating problems throughout the education system, with high rates of teen pregnancies and drop outs. Gender based violence can affect boys too, and sexual assaults by other boys and older men are not unheard of. In Maguzu, KZN, a new adolescent and youth friendly clinic aims to address these issues holistically by working with both boys and girls. Thabani (16) attends the clinic because he has big plans for the future and doesn’t want to throw them away. “I don’t follow the crowd who drink at taverns and take drugs. I’ve told them it damages the mind and body and leads to risky behaviour such as unprotected sex,” he says. “Some people do it because of peer pressure; others feel that they are worthless so may as well take drugs, such as someone who has a step-parent who mistreats them.” Thabani says that his goal is to study medicine, so he finds ways to handle stress in order to keep sight of his goals. “My way of dealing with problems is to dance. I am part of a dance group at school and also won a competition at a recent event, dancing Thuso Phala,” he says. He notes that all the boys in his group have girlfriends but don’t want to have sex with them. “We are afraid of diseases like STIs and HIV. In this area they also do virginity testing, so if you are found to have had sex or impregnated a girl, you will have to pay damages.” Education of young men about their bodies and their health is part of PEPFAR’s DREAMS programme addressing the risk of HIV infection, including poverty, gender inequality, sexual violence, and a lack of education. “It is important for boys to consider healthier forms of masculinity, to think through the consequences of their actions and to express their emotions more openly,” says Felicity Basson, who works to ensure the DREAMS programme provides youth health friendly services in KZN. Thabani has been living with his mother and aunt since his father passed away, and they struggle to make ends meet. “My family cannot afford to pay a fine and I do not want to burden them – I couldn’t do that to mama and mam’khulu.” His greatest dream is to become a doctor so that he can build a house for his mother. “I don’t believe in rushing through life − there is plenty of time when you are older. If you don’t think of your future, you will fall into a trap and achieve nothing in your life.” For more information on keeping yourself and your loved ones healthy, go to http://betteroffknowing.org.za/get-tested/hiv/ https://za.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/pepfar/dreams-south-africa/",,"['future', 'violence', 'men', 'protect', 'slow', 'young', 'youth', 'hiv', 'think', 'boys', 'dont', 'sex', 'women']","THE public face of the fight against HIV/AIDS in South Africa often centres on women – be it women going for antenatal screening or services for adolescent girls and young women.

KNOW YOUR HIV STATUS TODAY,“KNOW your status!”,,2018/12/05,DailySun,"“KNOW your status!” This is the rallying cry of World AIDS Day this year. The availability of self-screening HIV kits makes it easier for people to buy a kit and test in the privacy of their homes. According to Avert.org, South Africa has made huge improvements in getting people to test for HIV in recent years and is now almost at the 90-90-90 target with 86% of people aware of their status. But Mzansi still needs to work on reaching the people living with HIV who are unaware of their status, as they urgently need to get quality care and prevention services. Problems Unfortunately many barriers to HIV testing remain. Stigma and discrimination make people fear taking the HIV test. The need for confidential HIV testing is still a concern and too many people only get tested after showing the symptoms of Aids. Jackie Maimin, CEO of the Independent Community Pharmacy Association, said South Africa has the largest and most high-profile HIV epidemic in the world. An estimated 7,2 million people in South Africa were living with HIV in 2017. “We also account for a third of all new HIV infections in the southern African region. Just last year there were 270 000 new HIV infections and 110 000 deaths from AIDS-related illnesses. “Extensive HIV testing is needed to expand current treatment plans, which can make sure that all people living with HIV can lead healthy and productive lives. “The good news is that there are now a number of approved HIV self-screening kits available from local pharmacies that allow people to screen for HIV in the privacy of their own homes. The tests are highly specific for the HIV virus and have a 99% accuracy rate. They are a valuable indicator of the presence of antibodies to HIV infection.” There are two types of approved HIV self-screening tests – those that use a blood sample and those that use a saliva sample. Both are easy to use and give reliable results. Important: It takes between six to 12 weeks after the first infection for the body’s immune system to create enough antibodies to the HIV virus to be detectable by the test.",Health,"['status', 'virus', 'tests', 'know', 'test', 'selfscreening', 'living', 'africa', 'hiv', 'testing', 'today', 'world', 'south']","The availability of self-screening HIV kits makes it easier for people to buy a kit and test in the privacy of their homes.

CAN GENE THERAPY BE USED TO CURE HIV?,HIV/Aids has been plaguing us for a long time and researchers are on a mission to find a cure.,,2019/05/01,DailySun,"HIV/Aids has been plaguing us for a long time and researchers are on a mission to find a cure. A definite, traditional cure has not yet been established, but the latest developments in gene therapy to fight HIV may offer some hope. Natural immunity YourGenome defines gene therapy as ""when DNA is introduced into a patient to treat a genetic disease. The new DNA usually contains a functioning gene to correct the effects of a disease-causing mutation."" These efforts are inspired by a man who was cured of HIV infection a decade ago by a cell transplant from a donor with natural immunity to the virus. He is the only person known to have been cured of HIV infection. In all other cases, HIV cannot be eradicated and needs to be controlled by antiretroviral drugs. However, sometimes HIV infection cannot not be fully controlled by even the strongest drugs. One step further According to a New York Times article, gene therapy involves finding a way to create immunity by altering patients own cells, thereby removing the need for antiretrovirals. To achieve this, they tried cutting the patients DNA to disable the HIV entryway gene. The initial gene editing experiments were disappointing because the altered T cells were outnumbered by T cells that were not altered. A good sign was however that patients in those studies had a big drop in the number of cells where HIV lurked in a dormant state (reservoir of silent disease). Researchers are now hoping that keeping patients on strong antiviral medicines for at least a year will reduce this reservoir to a point where the body can control any residual disease by itself. University of Pennsylvania scientists are going a step further by adding a gene to help T cells recognise and kill HIV. This second part is called CAR-T therapy. Great strides The process of gene editing is showing great promise, as in the case of American Matt Chappellwhere it was a resounding success.(His HIV could not be fully controlled by the strongest Aids drugs.) Scientists removed some of Chappells blood cells, disabled a gene to help them resist HIV, and reintroduced these ""edited"" cells in 2014. Now his body controls HIV by itself – and researchers are trying to perfect the process that made this possible. So far, it has given the San Francisco man the next best thing to a cure. https://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/News/can-gene-therapy-be-used-to-cure-aids-20180223-2",Health,"['controlled', 'step', 'gene', 'cells', 'dna', 'hiv', 'reservoir', 'therapy', 'patients', 'used', 'cure', 'strongest']","A definite, traditional cure has not yet been established, but the latest developments in gene therapy to fight HIV may offer some hope.

SA PASSES FOR HIV TREATMENT BUT FAIL FOR CONDOMS,"While South Africa has increased HIV spending at district level with stellar results, access to condoms has plummeted, according to the latest District Health Barometer (DHB).",,2019/02/02,DailySun,"The HIV prevention drug dividing opinion Prep is a drug which can stop people getting HIV but not everyone wants to take it. Published on Thursday evening by the HST, the report revealed that, as a percentage of total spending on HIV, district health service expenditure has jumped from 7.3% to over 20% over the past 14 years. But, consistent condom use “continues to be low” and can be linked the number of condoms distributed by government, which fell sharply over the past year. Between 2016/17 and 2017/18, the condom distribution rate dropped from an average of 48 to 36 condoms distributed per adult male per year However, the researchers suggested that the rate may have been historically lower than reported and that this might be the most accurate estimate for condom distribution South Africa has ever had. They noted that this was because the data source for these statistics has recently changed and is now “more accurate than the recording done by facilities in the past”. Day, who is a technical specialist for the HST, told Health-e News that the increase of district-level spending has been largely driven the country’s continuously expanding HIV treatment programme which remains the largest in the world. Over four million people access antiretroviral medication through the state - mostly at primary level - which has driven this positive shift in expenditure. “Primary health care is the level of care that is the closest to the community and therefore has an important role in responding to the immediate healthcare needs of the community and preventing further ill health,” according to the report. At a time when the feasibility of the government’s National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme is being routinely questioned, the report authors noted that this shift in spending is essential because primary health care is the “fundamental building block” and “heartbeat” of the NHI. “There is overwhelming international evidence that increased health expenditure is associated with better health outcomes – and [primary health care] plays a pivotal role in improving the health of communities.” – Health-e News.",National,"['spending', 'fail', 'treatment', 'primary', 'care', 'condom', 'report', 'shift', 'condoms', 'rate', 'role', 'hiv', 'health', 'passes']","The HIV prevention drug dividing opinionPrep is a drug which can stop people getting HIV but not everyone wants to take it.

According to a Zimbabwean news site, NEWZIMBABWE.COM the Prophet says: “As you continue to take the AGUMA, you start to see your CD4 count disappearing until you become HIV negative.” Magaya said this on Sunday to a group of journalists from across Africa in Harare. “The herb is 100 percent organic. Why I saw so is because we found out that there are no side effects,” he said. The Harare prophet said he was already working with the Zimbabwean government which is taking his “cure” through some laboratory tests to see if his claims were feasible. “With the Government of Zimbabwe, are summoning the local research board, the Minister (Health) has already indicated to me that they are bringing people that are HIV positive and start testing them,” he added. Magaya said he discovered the “cure” some two years ago but used it secretly on HIV positive persons to first prove its effectiveness before he could boldly go public about it. “And I tell you that it’s a plant we have protected; just for you to know we are the first people who discovered that plant. So we have intellectual rights over that plant,” Magaya said. He also refused to share some of the chemical components that were being mixed with the herb saying there was not need to as those who produce anti-retroviral drugs have not also shared their secrets. “You can be told a chemical formulation of a cafenol but they won’t tell you the plant.” “Can you tell me the plant that makes Coca Cola? Because I strongly believe that Coca Cola has kept it for the sake of intellectual property rights,” he said.",International,"['zim', 'claims', 'plant', 'start', 'herb', 'zimbabwean', 'heal', 'rights', 'prophet', 'hiv', 'tell', 'cure', 'positive']","A Zimbabwean Prophet claims to have found a cure for HIV/AIDS.

Is HIV/AIDS A DISABILITY?,"For the past 28 years, the 1st of December has been commemorated as World AIDS Day",,2017/12/01,DailySun,"For the past 28 years, the 1st of December has been commemorated as World AIDS Day, highlighting the plight of the pandemic and also celebrating the momentous strides made in combating the virus. On its 29th anniversary, under the theme, “The Right to Health”, the day’s focus will be on raising awareness and educating people on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome(HIV/AIDS). In a country where over seven million people (12,6% of the population) are living with HIV, there have been calls to categorise the epidemic as a disability. Disability expert at Progression, Justene Smith, argues the pandemic can lead to disabilities. “There are situations where HIV/AIDS can prevent an individual from performing the inherent requirements of their job and can have a negative impact on their performance. In such cases, HIV/AIDS could be classified as a disability or a progressive disability, to be specific,” Smith says. Because HIV/AIDS attacks the immune system, this can cause, among other things, the degeneration of bone tissue and cartilage, resulting in chronic osteoarthritis, which itself can be classified as a disability, Smith explains. “This is most likely to occur before an individual who is HIV/AIDS positive has started their treatment or does not take their medication at all,” clarifies Smith. But Smith admits the use of antiretrovirals (ARV’s) can sometimes also ensure that persons who are HIV positive lead a healthy lifestyle and live a normal life, without the virus causing any interference in those individuals’ lives. “The effects of ARV’s in helping persons with HIV/AIDS is well documented, but the treatment can have side effects which, although rarely, couldresult in the person using them acquiring a disability,” says Smith “We have experienced cases where ARV’s have caused people to lose their eyesight. In such cases, visual impairment would be considered the disability and not HIV/ AIDS,” Smith explains. HIV/AIDS or ARV’S can result in a person acquiring a disability but the virus itself is very rarely considered a disability. HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, the body’s natural defence against illness. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell. As HIV destroys more CD4 cells, it gradually breaks down a person’s immune system. Additional information: What is HIV/ AIDS HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, our body’s natural defence against illness. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell. As HIV destroys more CD4 cells, it gradually breaks down a person’s immune system. The immune systems of persons living with HIV, and not receiving treatment, will find it harder and harder to fight off infections and diseases. It may take up to 10 or 15 years for the immune system to be compromised- a point where it can no longer defend itself, if HIV is left untreated. When the HI Virus has destroyed the vast majority of CD4 cells and the human body will no longer be able to fight off infections and diseases, it is at this stage that HIV becomes AIDS. If left untreated, AIDS will result in death. HIVAIDS Statistics There are 7,06 million people living with HIV in South Africa. An estimated 12,6% of the total population is HIV positive. Approximately one-fifth of South African women in their reproductive ages (15-49 years) are HIV positive.",Health,"['immune', 'smith', 'virus', 'cd4', 'disability', 'system', 'hiv', 'persons', 'hivaids', 'positive']","In such cases, HIV/AIDS could be classified as a disability or a progressive disability, to be specific,” Smith says.

MAN SENTENCED FOR NOT DISCLOSING HIS HIV STATUS,"An American is serving a 30-year sentence for having sex without disclosing his HIV status – although he used condoms, and didn't infect his partner.",,2018/07/26,DailySun,"An American is serving a 30-year sentence for having sex without disclosing his HIV status – although he used condoms, and didnt infect his partner. Kerry Thomas is in prison in the USA, serving a 30-year sentence for having sex twice without disclosing to his partner that he was HIV positive. Although Thomas used condoms, had an undetectable viral load and did not infect his partner, he was given two 15-year sentences to run consecutively. He has already served 10 years of his sentence. Criminalising the transmission of HIV Joining delegates to the International AIDS Conference by phone from his Idaho prison, Thomas said that while he regretted not disclosing his HIV status, “I worked with my doctor to protect my partner.” “It is high time to look at the growing move to criminalise the transmission of HIV, which is often based on a misunderstanding of how HIV is and isn’t transmitted,” said Professor Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International AIDS Society. Twenty top scientists, including Nobel Laureate Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, released a consensus statement at the conference yesterday after reviewing the best available scientific evidence relating to HIV transmission and concluded: It is not possible for an HIV positive person to transmit the virus in their saliva while kissing, biting or spitting. The risk of HIV transmission from a single act of unprotected sex is very low, and there is no possibility of transmission during either vaginal or anal sex if the HIV-positive partner has an undetectable viral load. It is not possible to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt that one person has infected another, even with the most advanced phylogenetic scientific tools. Some 68 countries have laws that criminalise HIV non-disclosure, exposure or transmission, while 33 others have applied similar laws in specific cases. Convicted for breastfeeding Thousands of people living with HIV have been prosecuted, most of who did not actually pass on the virus. Most prosecutions have taken place in the USA, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Zimbabwe. Sarai-Chisala Tempelhoff of the Women’s Lawyers Association of Malawi said that an HIV positive woman in her country had been convicted for breastfeeding her baby. “This prosecution for breastfeeding was not informed by science, and the magistrate demonstrated stigma not science,” said Templehoff. Edwin Bernard, global co-ordinator of the Global HIV Justice Network, said there was an urgent need to train and educate judges and magistrates, many of whom operated on the basis of prejudice not fact. Impact of prosecution South Africa has not adopted an HIV-specific criminal law, although there was a push to do so in 1999. “I think we can give credit to our Members of Parliament for that,” said Judge Edwin Cameron, who is attending the Aids conference. “There was a move in 1999 to make HIV transmission a specific crime, but this was ultimately rejected by our politicians, although HIV status can be considered an aggravation of sentence in rape,” said Cameron. “The scientific community has spoken and now the criminal justice sytem, law and policymakers must also consider the impact of prosecutions on the human rights of people living with HIV,” said Michaela Clayton of AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa (ARASA).

She said the boy later told his social worker his father had raped him. “He said he feared talking about it because his gogo once walked in on his dad putting his penis in his bum but she quickly closed the bedroom door and didn’t say anything.” Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said the case was closed in April.

NO HAVEN FOR ADULT HIV PATIENTS!,THE stigma that still surrounds their illness makes kasi life difficult for many HIV-positive people.,,2017/03/15,DailySun,"THE stigma that still surrounds their illness makes kasi life difficult for many HIV-positive people. This is despite numerous interventions to educate communities about the virus. Those who live in the townships south of Durban have always found a comforting and safe environment at the Blue Roof Wellness Centre in Wentworth. But now, after nearly 12 years of helping them, the non-profit organisation is turning them away. HIV sufferers said the announcement on Monday, that the NGO will no longer be offering services to adult patients from the end of the month, has left them heartbroken. A woman patient (51) from Umlazi said she had been collecting her HIV/Aids treatment at the centre for the past five years. “I stopped using clinics in Umlazi because people there called us names and spread hurtful gossip around the township. Ever since I joined the Blue Roof family, I have been living a very peaceful life.” A male patient from Lamontville (48) said the centre was located in a secluded part of Wentworth and that alone was to patients’ advantage. “There were no long queues and gossiping people loitering around. Their staff members are professional and caring. “We are deeply saddened that we’re going to be transferred to other facilities.” Daily Sun had been informed that the centre was completely shutting down for financial reasons, but centre manager Tom Butterworth said they would focus on providing services to youths only in future. “There is a wide access to HIV treatment for adults through the department of health. “Further information and guidance for adult patients regarding their transfer will be provided. “We will continue to offer services like HIV testing and treatment, support groups and pregnancy support to youngsters and children.”",,"['treatment', 'adult', 'centre', 'umlazi', 'roof', 'patients', 'blue', 'hiv', 'services', 'patient', 'haven', 'support']","Those who live in the townships south of Durban have always found a comforting and safe environment at the Blue Roof Wellness Centre in Wentworth.

AIDS CURE A POSSIBILITY!,"FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s boasting, in a tweet, about Mzansi having the largest HIV/Aids treatment programme in the world brought to mind the story of an alleged breakthrough by a Chinese scientist, He Jianku.",,2019/02/03,DailySun,"FORMER president Jacob Zuma’s boasting, in a tweet, about Mzansi having the largest HIV/Aids treatment programme in the world brought to mind the story of an alleged breakthrough by a Chinese scientist, He Jianku. First, Zuma wrote that more than3,9 million people were on the supposedly life pro-longing antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as of August 2017. At the time, the number of Mzansi HIV-positive people was said to be at more than 70 million. Now, Jianku has apparently edited or modified the DNA of recently-born twin girls, Lulu and Nana, such that they are protected from contracting the Aids-causing HIV. Surely, that should be a feat worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize. But there’s a big problem. Soon after revealing the results of his exploits in November, Jianku allegedly received death threats and went missing in early December. The scientist has also been vilified. The scientific community has accused him of ethical issues and experimenting on humans with a dangerous technology, a gene-editing tool called, CRISPR-Cas9. But this accusation assumes other sorts of accepted hi-tech products, like cars, aren’t dangerous. Also, Jianku might be facing possible corruption and bribery charges, which are punishable by death in China. The Chinese scientist appears to be truly some kind of a threat to business as usual, a problem to be neutralised or eliminated at all costs. Come to think of it, what will happen to the profits of pharmaceutical companies producing ARVs and other medication fed to those said to be infected by the virus? The 3,9 million people or the targeted more than 7 million South Africans living with Aids are simply a market, not humans, for pharmaceutical companies. Jianku, just like former president Thabo Mbeki, is trying to mess with the wealth accumulation programme, camouflaged as fake care, of some multinational corporates. In the name of health, many people are turned into addicts of chronic and other medication every day, so they become repeat customers. HERE’S the most revealing line from the Jianku affair: there’s fear that changes made on the DNA of the babies could be passed on to their next generations. Since when is passing on good genes, especially those that could possibly protect against diseases like HIV/Aids, be a bad thing? Perhaps, Jiaku’s achievement presents an opportunity. Governments of the continent might want to request Chinese authorities to donate Jianku to the Motherland instead of putting him to death. Africa could do with such a maverick, especially since it has been reported that 70% of the global HIV market (totaling nearly 37 million) is in Africa.",Eidos,"['aids', 'scientist', 'possibility', 'mzansi', 'million', 'jianku', 'theres', 'revealing', 'president', 'pharmaceutical', 'programme', 'chinese', 'cure']","First, Zuma wrote that more than3,9 million people were on the supposedly life pro-longing antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as of August 2017.

Those who said ""yes"" appear to have succumbed to stigma and the societal perceptions that have bedevilled HIV for a long time, while those who said ""no"" attributed the latest medical advancement and available treatment as a reason to stay in a relationship with and date someone who is HIV positive. I thought he would run away ""I will definitely leave. I dont want to be in a relationship because I pity someone, and I think my decision should be respected. It is better date someone who has the same status as you to avoid emotional and physical baggage,"" said Lebogang Molefe of Alexandra township. She believes she is still young and far from ready to settle down and commit to one partner forever. Her counterpart, Moribego Madubanya slightly disagrees: ""I think the circumstances that led to someone contracting the virus will determine whether we continue or not. Also, it helps when we disclose our status to each other early on in our relationship. I dont want to feel like I was betrayed."" Another young person, Tebogo Setshedi, said she has been living with HIV since 2007. She regards herself very lucky that she is in the relationship with someone who loves her regardless of her status. ""I couldnt believe that he decided to stay after I told him I am HIV positive. It’s not easy to find someone negative while you are HIV positive. I thought he would run away,"" she said. Although this was not easy to disclose early in their relationship, she is happy that finally she did. ""Sometimes you would want to wait and check how serious this person is about you."" Still a long way to go She said her boyfriend appeared extremely well informed about HIV, and they always use protection. If they ever decide to have children they will consult their doctor. Meanwhile, Fezile Masabane – also living with HIV, said she hasnt been lucky when falling for people who are HIV negative. They all ran away as soon as she declared her status. She believes there is still a long way to go in educating people about HIV. ""Many still believe you are dirty, cursed and promiscuous,"" she said. ""One day I dated a guy who was very serious about our relationship. He wanted to marry me and asked that we both go for an HIV test. He came out negative and I was positive. Although he insisted he still loved me, I could clearly see he was struggling to cope. The intimacy had gone. All that was left was him feeling sorry for me, thinking I was going to die."" A potential stressor Now she is happy and in a relationship with an HIV positive man. Her boyfriend Sibusiso Nhlapo agrees: ""I also found it difficult to date people different from me. With Fezile, we are happy. The language is the same, we understand each other."" Dr Sindi van Zyl, a renowed HIV expert, also supports the idea of same status relationships. ""Well, I must say that it is easier to date someone of the same status. Living with HIV is not a burdensome thing but sometimes people that are not living with HIV make it feel like it is. Sharing the same status removes a potential stressor from the relationship,"" she said, adding that she recommend that lovers disclose their status as soon as possible.

But more concerning for researchers was the occurrence of risky behaviour among respondents. It found that consistent condom use was low, early sexual debuts before the age of 15 had increased among males, and more than a third of young women had sexual relationships with older men. ""It is concerning to find very little behaviour change seems to have occurred since 2012,"" said Dr Mpumi Zungu, from the HSRCs HIV/Aids, STIs and TB (HAST) Research Programme, and a co-principal investigator (PI) of the survey. ""This suggests that most of the reduction in new infections was likely due to the impact of the expanded ARV treatment programme,"" she said. Decline in incidence rates The survey was based on interviews with 33 000 people between January and December 2017, with 24 000 of them agreeing to be tested for HIV. The survey found there had been a significant decline in incidence rates, but that there had been an estimated 231 100 new HIV infections in SA in 2017. The researchers said, although still high, it was a significant decline compared to 2012. The survey found that the HIV incidence rate was higher among females aged 15 - 24 years old, where it was three times that of their male counterparts. Dr Sizulu Moyo of the HAST Research Programme, and one of the co-PIs of the study, said the survey had found that more than 60% or an estimated 4.4 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). She said the study had also found that viral suppression was 87.3% among PLHIV who were on ART, with females generally being more likely to be virally suppressed than males among those aged 15 to 64 years old. ""This suggests that progress is being made in increasing ART coverage, however, more needs to be done to link those who test HIV positive to care as soon as they are tested, in line with the current policy of test and treat,"" Moyo said. The survey did, however, find that social and behaviour change communication campaigns - such as those implemented by Soul City, Centre for Communication Impact (CCI), LoveLife and Community Media Trust campaigns - were reaching South Africans. The study found that people who were highly exposed to these campaigns reported higher HIV testing, condom use, and correct knowledge of HIV compared to those who had lower or no exposure. https://www.health24.com/News/hiv-infections-down-but-still-230-000-new-cases-in-2017-hsrc-20180717",National,"['study', '2017', '000', 'infections', 'research', 'compared', 'significant', 'incidence', '230', 'hiv', 'survey', 'programme', 'hsrc', 'cases', 'decline']","Decline in incidence ratesThe survey was based on interviews with 33 000 people between January and December 2017, with 24 000 of them agreeing to be tested for HIV.

SA LEADS WORLD IN HIV NUMBERS!,SOUTH AFRICA has the largest number of HIV-infected people on ARV treatment.,,2018/12/05,DailySun,"SOUTH AFRICA has the largest number of HIV-infected people on ARV treatment. This was announced at a media briefing by the Human Sciences Research Council (HRSC) and UNAids in Tshwane on Monday. HIV drug resistance is also a concern, according to results from the fifth South African National HIV prevalence, incidence, behaviour and communication survey. It was conducted in 2017 by the HSRC and its partners. It found resistance to antiretroviral drugs in more than a quarter of virally unsuppressed people living with HIV. Resistance to ARVs was identified in 27,4% of survey respondents who were virally unsuppressed. Drug resistance was found in 55% of respondents on treatment and not virally suppressed and in 75% of those who had stopped treatment. Resistance was also found in 15% of respondents who reported no previous exposure to ARVs and their levels of drug resistance were the same among males and females and children aged 0-14 years and youths aged 15-24 years. The survey included those who may have stopped receiving care and those accessing private sector care. One of the principal investigators, Dr Sizulu Moyo, said this was the first South African HIV household survey to include HIV drug resistance testing. “It provides information that would not be provided by regular HIV drug resistance survey that use information from public sector clinics,” she said. Another researcher, an expert on HIV drug resistance from National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Dr Gillian Hunt, said the research showed that high numbers of patients who were no longer in care had heightened resistance.

The 24-year-old who recently released his 10th album called Yadli’intshebe, said he has a track on his album Sula Izinyembezi about what has killed so many maskandi artists. Khuzwayo, who was born in Nquthu in northern KZN, said he believed many maskandi artists died of Aids because they were not careful. “When they become famous, they have many girlfriends and they get confused. Sadly, most of them don’t use protection and then die of Aids,” he said. “I don’t want to mention names but I want to warn those who are still alive not to fall into the same trap.” Khuzwayo encouraged those who were HIV-positive to seek the right treatment. “It’s unfortunate that many maskandi artists don’t belive they can live better lives if they take treatment,” he said. “Many of them are too shy to come forward, get tested and use ARVs. “Others run to traditional healers because they believe they can help them.” The Impiyamatekisi hitmaker said when maskandi artists became ill, they didn’t want to tell the truth about their situation. “They usually say they have been bewitched by their rivals because of their talent,” he said. “They go to traditional healers for help but those healers don’t tell them the truth. “Traditional healers end up treating the wrong diseases while the person has HIV.” He said many people had asked him to quit music because they believed other artists were bewitching them. “I told them there is no witchcraft in the industry but many artists are killed by HIV because of fame.

SOUTHERN AFRICA'S UNITED SUCCESS AGAINST HIV!,OVER three-quarters of HIV-positive Namibians are “virally suppressed” or have low levels of the virus in their bodies and it has become the first African country to meet this target.,,,,"OVER three-quarters of HIV-positive Namibians are “virally suppressed” or have low levels of the virus in their bodies and it has become the first African country to meet this target. Bernard Haufiku, Namibian health minister, who spoke at the International Aids Conference, said: “We are on track with controlling HIV because treatment is also prevention.” Haufiku said that virally suppressed people have a lower chance of passing HIV to others. Namibia reduced its rate of new HIV infections by 50% over the past three years while eSwatini reduced its rate of new HIV infections by 44% since 2011. ESwatini’s universal test-and-treat method provided all people with ARVs immediately after HIV diagnosis. Dr Velephi Okello, from eSwatini’s health ministry, said: “This shows that treatment-as-prevention methods work.” South Africa’s new HIV incidence rates dropped by 44%, according to a recent HSRC household study. Botswana reported that a package of interventions – expanded HIV testing, earlier treatment and male circumcision – led to a 30% drop in new HIV cases over 30 months. “It is great to get some good news from southern Africa,” said Professor Linda-Gail Bekker, president of International Aids Society and international chair of Aids 2018.

How will you know your status if you don’t get tested? Though we commemorate the 30th anniversary of World Aids Day, this virus still remains our worst adversary.We need to get tested. Knowing your status helps one to make well-informed decisions. Someone who is ignorant and reluctant to go for tests is like a reckless driver who disregard road safety rules which serve to protect their own life. If you know your HIV status, you’ll begin to take treatment and lead a healthy lifestyle. On this year’s World Aids Day, we should personalize the risk of HIV infection. Let’s avoid engaging in unsafe sex. Condomise or abstain from sex. If you test positive, you shouldn’t lose hope and think it’s the end of the world. You’d rather start taking treatment and eating healthy foodstuff to prolong your life. Leading a reckless and unhealthy lifestyle like smoking and boozing can worsen your condition.Being HIV-positive doesn’t mean you’re useless. You can still lead a prolonged, productive life and contribute to society.HIV is manageable; however, about half of the seven million people in South Africa living with the virus are not on treatment! Not taking treatment even though you’re positive is like daring to go into a lion’s den without a weapon for self-defence. I urge people living in the rural areas to get tested and know their status. Knowing your status lifts a load off your shoulders. It frees you from possible doubt. I encourage young people as well to stop engaging in unprotected sex this festive season. Married or unmarried couples should avoid engaging in extramarital sex to avoid the spread of HIV. HIV is a burden on the shoulder of the World and as the nations, we should take a pledge in reducing infection rate. World Aids Day is a very important reminder that a lot still needs to be done all over the world to educate people about this condition. We should raise public awareness and stop the stigmatisation of people living with HIV. It doesn’t respect our status. It affects the rich and the poor, parents and children.

HOW TO DISCLOSE TO KIDS THEY ARE HIV POSITIVE,AT what age do you tell your child they were born HIV positive?,,2017/12/23,DailySun,"AT what age do you tell your child they were born HIV positive? Most mums find it very uncomfortable to disclose their HIV-positive status to their children, while other mums don’t tell their children at all if they were born HIV positive. Dr Marnie Vujovic, adolescent psychosocial programme manager at Right to Care, said revealing and discussing a child’s HIV status with them would be frightening but they needed to be told. “Many parents and caregivers delay telling children about their HIV-positive status or mislead the child about why they take anti-retroviral (ARV) medication.” She said waiting until a child enters adolescence before they know about their HIV status could be a problem for the child. “Adolescence is the worst time to disclose because a young person is already struggling to come to terms with looming adulthood.” The Right to Care paediatric and adolescent programme has developed useful tools to help clinics disclose to their patients and to run adolescent support groups. It also provides training, mentoring, and runs helplines to assist clinics in managing their paediatric and adolescent patients. “HIV in children, adolescents and adults can be controlled if everyone with HIV knows their status and takes ARVs consistently.” Significant advances have been made with regards to managing HIV/Aids as well as reducing the number of new HIV infections among children in Mzansi.

Ramathuba was speaking at a graduation ceremony for nurses trained in the initiation and management of anti-retroviral treatment. The ceremony was held at Bolivia Lodge outside Polokwane on Thursday. The MEC gave a thumbs up to programme’s top six graduates. She encouraged the nurses to provide high quality service. “We want our graduates to ensure the people of Limpopo live long and healthy lives,” she said. Ramathuba said 95% of the people who signed up for the programme passed. She said the pass rate was a good sign for the department. “The graduates’ job is to ensure that HIV-positive people who are taking ARVs live healthily.” Ramathuba said since the department launched the programme in 2010, a large number of HIV-positive patients have been transferred from hospitals to primary healthcare facilities. “The programme has played a significant role in increasing the life expectancy of HIV-positive people. “It has also improved the accessibility of ARVs at universities and correctional service centres.” Ramathuba said HIV-positive people in Limpopo will continue to receive ARVs because the department is committed to promoting healthy living. “We want 90% of people to receive HIV treatment by 2020. “The department appreciates the fact that HIV-positive people in Limpopo are committed to taking their medication.”",,"['fight', 'arvs', 'mec', 'taking', 'hivpositive', 'receive', 'live', 'department', 'hiv', 'nurses', 'programme', 'limpopo', 'ready']","LIMPOPO Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba says her department is working hard to put an end to new HIV/Aids infections in the province.

MTV SHUGA: DOWN SOUTH 2 TO DEAL WITH HIV-RELATED ISSUES,"The second season of acclaimed TV show, MTV Shuga: Down South will make its debut on local screens in February 2019.",,2018/11/22,DailySun,"The second season of acclaimed TV show, MTV Shuga: Down South will make its debut on local screens in February 2019. It promises to be a hard-hitting season dealing with issues such as HIV, self-testing, PrEP, toxic masculinity, sexual identity and physical abuse. The new season is in partnership with Unitaid, the MTV Staying Alive Foundation (MTV SAF) and the London School of Hy-giene & Tropical Medicine. In the new season, viewers will discover that characters from the first season have grown up in addition to meeting the brand new characters that will be introduced to bring a new dynamic to the show. The new characters will comprise of familiar faces and some new faces who were discovered during the MTV Shuga open auditions which were held in Durban, Johannesburg and across digital platforms earlier this year. The auditions produced nine new faces including Ayanda Mkhize, Rosemary Zimu, Cwenga Ndaba, Lebohang Msiza and Malibongwe Mdwabe who has told the media how important the MTV Shuga story line is. “I think for me I understood what MTV Shuga’s mandate is, I understood what it stands for and that it’s not just a show, it’s more of a movement. And those things are very important when you go into any audition, you need to know why you’re going there,” he said. The show is directed by the multi-award-winning, Thishiwe Ziqubu who has been tasked with the creative direction of this impactful new season. “In this season the characters have grown up. They are not in high school anymore and they’ve led us to the city where the hustle is real. It’s not a pretty or idealised version of what Joburg looks like, but it’s the truth of the grungy difficult Joburg,” she commented. “The brand-new season opens after the tragic death of Tsholo, with Sol returning to Zenzele after a short stint in prison. His return to the township triggers a series of events as Khensani campaigns the community to boycott his taxi business, and he wrestles with the abuse his father inflicts on his mother,” said MTV. Viewers will also follow Ipeleng, Q, Zamo and Reggie as they leave school and head to university, start businesses or find jobs in the real world. Old favourites make new friends and fall in love with new people as characters like Daniel, Dineo, Kwanele, Masego and Andile enter the MTV Shuga universe. Having begun 10 years ago in Nigeria, the MTV Shuga movement has sought to tackle hard-hitting, pertinent issues without shying away from the difficulty of so doing. All of the different iterations of the show around the continent deal with real-life topics that affect the modern day youth. “The MTV Shuga directive is to educate young audiences on sexual health and engage with them on real issues that they face in their daily lives. We’re grateful to bring audiences MTV Shuga: Down South 2 together with Unitaid where these tough conversations are brought to the fore,” said Executive Director for the MTV Staying Alive Foundation and MTV Shuga Executive Producer, Georgia Arnold. Meanwhile, Executive Vice-President and Managing Director for Viacom International Media Networks Africa (VIMN Africa) and BET International, Alex Okosi has called this project a “powerful catalyst”. “The movement, led by the MTV Staying Alive Foundation together with MTV Base, has proven to impact youth across the continent by informing and ultimately changing their behaviour so they can live safer and better lives.

To mark the day, 11 clinics in seven universities across the country received pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is a preventative treatment through which people, who had a high risk exposure to an HIV infection, take anti-HIV medicine daily to lower the chances of infection. The roll-out was done by the Higher Education and Training HIV/Aids Programme in partnership with the health department. SunWellbeing spoke to a few students about the programme. Lefa Lichaba (19 ), a second year BSc student, said: “I support the idea because young people are affected the most. This prevention measure improves the situation.” Mxolisi Mbatha (22), a first year public relations student at Nelson Mandela University, said: “As young people we must learn to play safe or we will ultimately suffer. Prevention will always help.” From University of Limpopo, Matsena Motswaledi (20), a third-year law student, said: “I am not against the idea but I do not want young people to become even more sexually active because of this.” The health department has previously deployed PrEP only among very high risk people such as sex workers and men who have sex with men (M2M). Now some universities across SunLand are included as well. “Pre-exposure prophylaxis is now a universally accepted prevention methodology,” said Dr Ramneek Ahluwalia, director of the higher education programme. “Multiple clinical studies have shown that there’s an up to 90% reduction in the infection rate of high risk populations such as sex workers and M2M.” Young people aged 15 to 24, particularly young women, are among the population groups which are most vulnerable to the HIV exposure.",Health,"['student', 'preexposure', 'risk', 'sex', 'high', 'university', 'prevention', 'universities', 'workers', 'prophylaxis', 'young', 'meds', 'welcomed', 'hivaids']","THE World Contraception Day might have come and gone, but the reality is HIV/Aids continues to claim new victims daily.

The fight against HIV is far from over for SA!,WHEN Ndlela Howard Dhlamini disclosed his HIV-positive status more than a decade ago.,,2015/12/01,DailySun,"WHEN Ndlela Howard Dhlamini disclosed his HIV-positive status more than a decade ago, ignorance about HIV led his local tavern to refuse to reuse the glass he drank from and his community to demand the removal of a public phone he used. As South Africa prepares to celebrate World Aids Day on 1 December, this kind of stigma fuelled by HIV myths may be a memory for Dhlamini but not for everyone living with the virus. Dhlamini was diagnosed with HIV on his 18th birthday in 1999 after testing at a friend’s suggestion. He said he almost didn’t make it to the clinic. “I almost forgot because I was drunk and with a girl,” said Dhlamini who lives in Bohlokong township outside Bethlehem in the Free State. “I used to drink a lot and have a lot of girlfriends back home and at school in Durban.” Like many, Dhlamini said he was shocked at the diagnosis and initially reacted in anger. “At that time. I had 10 girlfriends who loved me so much because I was so popular,” said Dhlamini, who added that he had been treated for multiple sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during school. “I was so angry, I just wanted to infect them all.” Both multiple concurrent partnerships and STIs can increase a person’s HIV risk. In the case of STIs, those such as herpes and syphilis, can often lead to sores or blisters. These kinds of breaks in the skin may allow HIV to more easily into the body. Convinced he was going to die, Dhlamini began planning his funeral programme that night. “I then went into my bedroom took an A4 page and started drafting my funeral programme,” Dhlamini remembered. “I then fell asleep and my mom came to check up on me. She found the note and she was so angry,” he said. “She said I still had my life to live, I was not going to die.” Dhlamini describes the next three years as the hardest in his life. “There was a public phone at the corner near my home,” he said. “I went there and made a phone call. After that, people protested that the public phone should be removed because (they thought) I would infect them.” “At the tavern, they had a glass marked with a black pen to show that I was the only would who could drink from it,” said Dhlamini who said the community’s stigma was fuelled by a lack of awareness about HIV was spread. HIV can only be passed from person to person via exposure to infected body fluids like blood, semen, vaginal secretions and breast milk. It is usually transmitted via unprotected sex but can also be transmitted by sharing needles or from a mother to her child during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding. You cannot catch HIV from casual contact like shaking hands or sharing food or drink with people living with HIV. Today, UNAIDS estimates about 6.8 million South Africans are living with HIV, but recent research shows levels of accurate knowledge about how the virus is transmitted are declining nationally. This decline has been accompanied by an increase in HIV risk behaviours, according to the Human Science Research Council’s latest household HIV survey. It may also be driving stigma. Released earlier this year, South Africa’s first HIV stigma index measured levels of stigma and discrimination due to HIV status among more than 10,000 people living with the disease. The survey found high levels of self blame and shame among people living with the virus. About 10 percent of those surveyed reporting being excluded from a family or social gathering in the last year and about half of these people felt their HIV status was the cause. About one in 10 of those surveyed also reported considering suicide. Globally, fear of social rejection and discrimination are still among the most common reasons people give for avoiding HIV testing and care, according to UNAIDS. In its latest report, the UN body has argued that decreasing stigma is crucial to tackling HIV. It also highlighted succesfull ways countries around the world are tackling stigma including Ghana’s introduction of an sms and online system allowing people living with HIV to report stigma and sensitisation of health care workers in Jamaica. In South Africa, The South African National AIDS Council has partnered with Legal AID South Africa and public interest law organisation Section27 to provide legal assistance to people who believe they have been discriminated against due to their HIV status. For Dhlamini, things changed when he disclosed to his church. “People and my family started to support me,” said Dhlamini who now volunteers with the local community-based organisation Dihlabeng Development Initiative to educate people about HIV prevention and teenage pregnancy. “My family has always been there for me through it all.” – Health-e News. http://www.health24.com/Medical/HIV-AIDS/News/the-fight-against-hiv-is-far-from-over-for-sa-20151201",National,"['fight', 'stis', 'status', 'dhlamini', 'far', 'living', 'transmitted', 'stigma', 'hiv', 'phone', 'south', 'public']","“There was a public phone at the corner near my home,” he said.

Research presented on Wednesday at the 9th International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference on HIV Science taking place in Paris this week suggests daily cannabis use could have a protective benefit on the liver of patients co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV. Marijuana may protect the liver Conducted by the French National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS), the study investigated the impact of marijuana use on the risk of hepatic steatosis (abnormal presence of fat in the liver). According to the United States-based health research organisation Mayo Clinic, fat in the liver can cause inflammation, scarring and irreversible damage. It said, at its most severe, the condition can progress to liver failure. Of the 838 patients enrolled in the study 14% reported using weed every day. Daily use was found to be associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of steatosis, which was not found in less frequent cannabis users. More research is needed Dr Patrizia Carrieri, a researcher at the French National Institute of Health and Medical research, said that more research is needed on the interactions between using psychoactive substances and liver disease progression to confirm any findings. “The ANRS cohort data obviously cannot be used to recommend the consumption of any substance or product to HIV and hepatitis C co-infected patients.

AIDS BATTLE NOT YET WON!,TODAY is World Aids Day.,,2017/12/01,DailySun,"TODAY is World Aids Day. The South African National Aids Council has urged South Africans to mark the day by wearing a red ribbon pinned to their clothing. “About 270 000 South Africans became infected with HIV last year alone,” said council CEO Dr Sandile Buthelezi. Worldwide, about 5 000 people become infected every day. Urvashi Ramjee from Old Mutual said while improved education and access to ARVs continued to improve HIV status in South Africa, there was still a lot of work to do. “Business can play a leading role in removing the stigma attached to HIV,” she said. About seven million South Africans are HIV-positive. This is an increase from the estimated five million South Africans living with HIV in 2002. However, disability claims for the disease have gone down a lot, which indicates improved management of the disease. Old Mutual disability claims related to HIV/Aids have dropped from 16% in 2010 to 8% this year. Ramjee said the improved roll-out of ARVs in public and private hospitals and clinics had resulted in the elimination of waiting lists for ARVs. “Today ARVs are given to patients much sooner than in the past, meaning treatment is starting earlier,” she said. “Managing the disease has become less difficult for patients than for people with diabetes. “ARVs are compressed into one daily tablet, while someone with diabetes is required to change their lifestyle to manage the disease.” Ramjee said this was contributing to the second trend they had noticed in claims over the past seven years – namely, that more people with HIV are returning to the workplace, and at a much faster rate.",National,"['aids', 'claims', 'arvs', 'past', 'africans', 'won', 'mutual', 'hiv', 'improved', 'battle', 'patients', 'south', 'seven']","The South African National Aids Council has urged South Africans to mark the day by wearing a red ribbon pinned to their clothing. “About 270 000 South Africans became infected with HIV last year alone,” said council CEO Dr Sandile Buthelezi.

‘HEALED’ – BUT DEAD!,"FOR four years, Zakhele lived a healthy life with HIV.",,2019/03/26,DailySun,"FOR four years, Zakhele lived a healthy life with HIV. But he made a decision that proved to be fatal. “He said he was healed and stopped taking ARVs,” said his sister Nomthandazo Ndaba. The 40-year-old from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, said her brother started attending Alleluia Ministries International in 2016. Nomthandazo said her brother was a staunch follower of the church. “He never missed a service. He insisted on going even when he was clearly not fit to attend,” she said. In October the family got a surprise visit from home-based care workers. “They came to ask us why they hadn’t seen Zakhele at the clinic. “He refused to listen to them when they begged him to take his treatment.” Zakhele died in December, aged 34. “In his final days Zakhele was weak. He had blisters all over his body. He looked nothing like the person he was when he first went to that church.” In a church video Zakhele is seen lying on a hospital bed, with Pastor Alph Lukau praying for him. After the prayers Zakhele starts walking around. A message then appears: “He’s healed of TB, diabetes and HIV.” In a statement, church spokeswoman Busi Gaca said the church believes that medicine and the church are not separate. “We have qualified medical doctors serving under Pastor Lukau,” she said. “The church always states that the person must go back to their doctors to verify their healing.” She said the video shows Pastor Lukau laying hands on the man, who then gets up after receiving healing from God. “At no stage does Pastor Lukau tell the man he’s healed. It’s rather his own testimony that he has received a miracle from God,” Gaca said.",National,"['seen', 'healed', 'person', 'hes', 'video', 'church', 'man', 'zakhele', 'lukau', 'pastor', 'dead']","“He said he was healed and stopped taking ARVs,” said his sister Nomthandazo Ndaba. “They came to ask us why they hadn’t seen Zakhele at the clinic.

TO GET THE CUT OR NOT,CIRCUMCISION is a topic we must take seriously.,,2018/08/07,DailySun,"CIRCUMCISION is a topic we must take seriously. The danger of boys dying or being maimed at unmonitored initiation schools remains a big headache for government. Medical circumcision also helps reduce the rate of new HIV infections. Mzansi has over 7 million people living with Aids and this increases by around 300 000 new infections every year. Right to Care, a non profit organisation that supports and delivers prevention, care and treatment services to Aids and TB sufferers, said circumcision not only reduces HIV infection but offers other gains too. A study on the cost and impact of a large-scale circumcision programme in Mzansi found that if eight in 10 men got circumcised, about R225 billion spent on HIV care and treatment costs could be saved. As recommended by the World Health Organisation, medical male circumcision needs to be offered as part of country’s HIV-prevention strategy package. The Mzansi medical circumcision programme started in 2010 and operates on males from 15 to 49 years every year. About 2,3 million circumcisions were performed in Mzansi since 2010. Right to Care says it works with community leaders to dispel circumcision myths such as the healing process takes too long, circumcision reduces sexual pleasure or that circumcised men don’t need to use condoms. Right to Care wants 2 million more men circumcised by 2020. Right to Care follows the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone.

THE TRAUMA OF SURVIVING RAPE,"THERE are as many theories as to why rape is so out of control in Mzansi, but that’s not the most concerning issue on the mind of a rape victim.",,2018/09/23,DailySun,"THERE are as many theories as to why rape is so out of control in Mzansi, but that’s not the most concerning issue on the mind of a rape victim. A leading HIV/Aids NGO, Right to Care, has asked raped men and women to report the crime to the police first and then access healthcare services as soon as possible afterwards. Right to Care spokeswoman Palesa Khambi said: “While most acts of sexual violence are committed by men against women, men are also raped, and when they are they usually also suffer unnecessary ridicule and humiliation from their peers and the community regarding their sexuality.” The consequences of rape are severe as it risks exposure to sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/Aids. Men and women also have to face stigma about their sexuality or sexual behaviour. Women also risk pregnancy. “If you have been sexually assaulted, it’s important that you keep your clothes and don’t wash – these contain vital evidence. The failure of police to behave appropriately is why most rapes are unreported. Rape is a crime. It was not your fault. If you did not agree or consent to the event, it’s sexual assault. It does not matter what you were wearing, how you were acting, what drugs you took or drank, or if the act was violent or not, you’re a victim of a crime. Even if the cops tell you to get lost, keep you waiting or even get hostile, you must insist on them getting the crime reported. If they refuse to take you seriously or insult you, it’s important not to get angry. It’s wise if you or people with you can record the activity on your phones. IF you are the victim of a sex crime, you must: - Get to a safe place immediately. - Tell a person or people you know and trust – you need their support. - Go to the police and report the sex crime. The police have no authority to tell you if or when you can or can not lay a charge of rape or sexual assault. - If the police at the front desk are unco-operative, ask to speak to the station commander. - You can report the rape at any police station but the investigation starts sooner if it’s reported at a station closer to the place of the rape. - If you are worried that about your rapist or rapists attacking you to keep you quiet, ask that the rapist or rapists not be allowed bail. - Write down the case number, names and numbers of the police in charge of your case. You can take a photo of the charge sheet. - Go to the nearest hospital, clinic or Thuthuzela Care Centre immediately but no later than 72 hours. Don’t eat or drink until you see a doctor. Ask for post-exposure STI and pregnancy prophylaxis.",Health,"['surviving', 'station', 'trauma', 'care', 'report', 'charge', 'tell', 'men', 'sexual', 'crime', 'rape', 'women']","THERE are as many theories as to why rape is so out of control in Mzansi, but that’s not the most concerning issue on the mind of a rape victim.

Lately, they seem to be failing at work and struggling to provide. It’s never easy for any woman to stay calm when all the responsibilities are hers. Women are created to nurture, love and support their husbands. There’s so much you can do about this, as you did make a vow to stand by him for better or worse. This is the “worse” part. It’s important that you encourage him and help him remember who he was when he married you. Help him tap back into himself and his abilities. KEEP IT! This is the part that validates your union.

That’s where I met my boyfriend. He broke up with his baby mama because he saw me and liked me. At first, I didn’t like him at all, but those feelings changed and became love. So when the baby mama found out we’re dating, she started calling me and threatening me to stay away from “her man”. I stayed away from him for a couple of weeks, but then we got back together. The problem is, she told me he’sHIV-positive. I was shocked because I slept with him without a condom and he took my virginity. So, after hearing that, I broke up with him. He admitted that he is indeed HIV-positive. I was so stressed! I went to the doctor and got tested myself, but the results came back negative. He kept calling me, asking for forgiveness. So now, I’ve taken him back and I love him with all my heart. Am I doing the wrong thing? WELCOME TO LIFE, BABY GIRL! I know how beautiful love is and how it gives any woman a reason to live, but at the same time, love should be lovely, not forced, and less cloudy. There’s nothing you can do regarding your man’s baby mama as that is his responsibility. If he loves you, he should manage this situation and it shouldn’t affect you. If you live under threats and you have no protection from your partner, then he’s not doing his duty in protecting you. So what makes you think he would protect you from any illnesses and viruses? You’re too young to be considering such major decisions. You’re educated and have the opportunity of a great life ahead of you. Marriage should wait.

WORKING TO END JUDGEMENT,WILL Mzansi ever be free of its many prejudices?,,,,"WILL Mzansi ever be free of its many prejudices? While gay men can’t visit many health centres without being insulted and hated, a few places are working to end the stigma. The Me1st campaign, which was started last year, kicked off its roadshow at places in Kimberley such as Sol Plaatjie University, Tata Tavern in Gaaleshwe, Modder Rivier and the Rose Club in Richie. Each event offered sexual advice and professional counselling, voluntary tests and a booth full of sex toys – and no hate. Me1st, launched by the Right to Care in partnership with LifeLine Northern Cape, aims to make sure that men and women who engage in same-sex sexual relationships put their health first. To make this possible, the discrimination against homosexuality needs to be removed from Mzansi’s healthcare systems. Every Mzansi person, gay or straight, has the right to get the care they deserve without any judgement levelled against them.. Me1st, with partnered clinics across the country, provides 100% confidential and discreet screenings for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in an understanding environment. Cedric Fourie, Skeen Saam actor, said: “There are a lot of people who don’t know they are living with HIV and are spreading it around. “Ignore your fears and take the test as part of the Me1st campaign. It’s better to know your status now than when it’s too late. “Treatment and counselling is freely available. Life doesn’t need to be too short, guys. I put myself first, so this weekend get tested and put yourself first too.” Brende Harker, director of LifeLine, said: “We are excited to be part of Me1st. “Stigma and discrimination are the main reasons why men who have sex with men avoid testing for HIV as many mainstream healthcare providers are insensitive and judgemental. They need to provide HIV messages specific to all clients.” For more information visit me1st.co.za/",,"['judgement', 'me1st', 'mzansi', 'men', 'working', 'end', 'places', 'hiv', 'sexual', 'need', 'visit', 'sex', 'right']","While gay men can’t visit many health centres without being insulted and hated, a few places are working to end the stigma.

PUBLIC CAN SEE OUR HIV STATUS!,"THE old Polyclinic in P Section of KwaMashu, north of Durban, is an HIV centre.",,2017/08/01,DailySun,"THE old Polyclinic in P Section of KwaMashu, north of Durban, is an HIV centre. The clinic was turned into an HIV treatment and collection facility as well as a circumcision facility in 2012. However, patients who visit the centre are not sure whether the move by the health department of the province was a wise one. The patients feel that by visiting the clinic or getting treatment there they are indirectly revealing their HIV status to other community members. A woman (37) said whenever she goes into the facility to collect her treatment, she overhears a group of people talking and laughing behind her back. “They say, ‘kushukuthi losisi uya-tracker’, which means ‘this woman is HIV-positive’,” she said. The patient said this does not make her feel good about her life. “I do not want my status to be known yet, but by collecting my treatment there I am indirectly revealing it. “I am not happy about this, but I do not know what to do about it.” The woman said she had tried to express her concerns to nurses at the new Polyclinic just a few metres away, but they simply told her there was nothing they could do to help her. “I was trying to find out if it was possible for me to get my treatment from them,” she said. “They told me that as much as they understood my frustrations, there was nothing they could do for me because the department had decided to adopt that system.” Another patient (42), also collecting treatment at the centre, said that since women did not get circumcised, it was easy for people to deduce that they were there to get HIV treatment. “We want to urge the department to consider changing this system. “Not all of us are comfortable with other people knowing our HIV status,” said the patient. Agiza Hlongwane of the health department’s communications department said: “As much as we understand the frustration of HIV-positive patients, we cannot make changes overnight.”",National,"['treatment', 'status', 'facility', 'told', 'polyclinic', 'department', 'hiv', 'woman', 'patients', 'revealing', 'public']","THE old Polyclinic in P Section of KwaMashu, north of Durban, is an HIV centre.

NEW HIV SELF-TESTING KITS,TESTING for HIV is becoming freely available to people in Mzansi.,,2016/12/07,DailySun,"TESTING for HIV is becoming freely available to people in Mzansi. Dr Amir Shroufi, Doctors Without Borders’ South African medical co-ordinator, says they welcome the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) released guidelines for HIV self-testing and partner notification this week. They fully encourage any efforts to implement self-testing more widely and make self-test kits freely available to the public. “Self-testing empowers people to know their status. The huge potential offered by this new tool improves access to patient-centred testing should be grabbed with both hands,” said Shroufi. At present, self-testing can act as a screening tool to minimise the time people need to spend at healthcare services. It also can be done in the privacy of your own home, which allows people to refer themselves to healthcare services if they test HIV-positive. The finalisation of South Africa’s next national strategic plan for HIV, TB, and sexually-transmitted infections for 2017 to 2022, should set high ambitions for the introduction and availability of self-tests over the next five years. Doctors Without Borders’ experience has shown that different testing methods reach different groups of people, and new methods are likely to be particularly important in reaching those who remain untested. Long waiting times at healthcare facilities, or being asked to repeat counselling sessions at each test may push people from accessing conventional HIV testing services. Patients and communities should have the option to decide when to test for HIV and choose if they want to do it in privacy. “Our research in Khayelitsha, in the Western Cape and Eshowe in KZN has shown that self-tests are an acceptable form of testing – including for the youth, who are at a higher risk of HIV infection. If used correctly, under supervision, it should return accurate results,” he said. In KZN, outreach testing by Doctors Without Borders counsellors and community health workers in Eshowe and Mbongolwane made it possible to learn one’s HIV status while at school, work, home, or doing business in town, and increased the numbers of people tested. Self-tests can take HIV testing a step closer to these communities, though further research is urgently needed to better understand strategies for self-test distribution, as well as how best to support those who test positive and the best course of treatment.",Health,"['tool', 'borders', 'status', 'shown', 'selftesting', 'test', 'hiv', 'testing', 'kits', 'south', 'healthcare']","Dr Amir Shroufi, Doctors Without Borders’ South African medical co-ordinator, says they welcome the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) released guidelines for HIV self-testing and partner notification this week.

Instead of keeping quiet about her status, Mabele publicly announced it in 1992, Ramaphosa said during a eulogy for the respected HIV/Aids activist and sangoma at her funeral at Rhema Bible Church. This made her one of the first black South Africans to do so. Mabele died of pneumonia on July 10. A memorial service was held for her at the Wits University Great Hall in Braamfontein, Joburg, on Sunday. ""She felt the full force of stigma,"" Ramaphosa said. The response from the public had forced her to stop her medical technology studies. The Peninsula Technikon, where she was studying, told her it feared she might infect other students in the laboratory. ""Her hospital file was stamped with a big red X and nurses who treated her asked her if she was a sex worker."" Ramaphosa said that despite the daily attacks on Mabele’s dignity, she had the resilience and fortitude to form the Positive Women’s Network at Garankuwa Hospital. Two years later she helped set up the Treatment Action Campaign to fight for the government to provide anti-retroviral treatment. She helped create safe spaces where women with HIV/Aids could go. ""Prudence bravely opened new frontiers of struggle. She was among Aids activists who were essentially fighting a struggle to be human, to be remembered as worthy, normal individuals with a manageable condition."" Mabele gave voice to thousands whose stories and experiences, fears and dreams often went unheard, Ramaphosa said. ""She brought comfort to those she knew were pained by physical discomfort, social stigma and the violation of their fundamental human rights."" She was not shy to speak truth to power and never stopped questioning or confronting those she believed were neglecting their duty to society. Her vision was for a South African healthcare system that cared for everyone, especially the poor. ""She dreamed of a South Africa that educated and skilled its young people. She spoke of a South Africa that had a leadership core that had integrity."" Mabele wanted a South Africa that did everything to advance the interests of all citizens, not just a few. She envisaged a South Africa free of corruption. ""A South Africa where the resources of our nation were used efficiently and prudently to advance the lives of the poor. A South Africa where women were affirmed and felt safe.

FIGHTING HIV WITH NEEDLES!,There is a great need for awareness and safety for those who share needles to inject drugs directly into their bodies.,,2017/02/15,DailySun,"There is a great need for awareness and safety for those who share needles to inject drugs directly into their bodies. Shaun Shelly, national policy, advocacy and human rights manager for TB and HIV Care, an organisation working to prevent, find and treat TB and HIV in communities, said there are about 67 000 injecting drug users in Mzansi. Shelly, who is also a researcher in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Pretoria, said those who inject drugs are 28 times more likely to have HIV than the general population, according to a 2014 UNAids report. In Mzansi, HIV prevalence is lower among drug users, but will be a problem if not addressed, as 5% to 10% of new HIV infections worldwide are due to needle sharing, said UNAids’ 2013 report. Shelly said more information had to be shared on this after a University of Pretoria (UP) social worker and two members of OUT – an organisation dedicated to building healthy and empowered lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities – were arrested in Tshwane for distributing sterile water to drug users who inject drugs. The project, run by OUT Wellbeing, is supported by the Department of Health and UP. The Step Up Project includes handing out sterile injecting equipment in packs with water, gauze, alcohol swabs and the like; behaviour change interventions, support services, a drop-in centre and clinic, referrals to hospitals, information and information on antiretrovirals, HIV and hepatitis C testing, wound care and more.

FACEBOOK AND TEEN RISKY SEX = HIV NIGHTMARE,There is a link between online social networking technologies and increased risky sexual behaviour.,,2016/12/01,DailySun,"There is a link between online social networking technologies and increased risky sexual behaviour. Young Swazi adults who spend a significant amount of time on Facebook and have previously had sex with someone they met on the popular social networking site are likely to have several partners, according to a study we conducted in Swaziland. The backdrop to the survey was that Swaziland has identified multiple sexual partners as a major risk factor in the transmission of HIV. Swaziland has the highest HIV infection rate in the world. In 2015 about 28% of people between the ages of 15 and 49 were HIV positive in Swaziland. The country has a population of 1.3 million people. As a key strategy to manage the pandemic Swaziland’s Ministry of Health has prioritised policies to try and reduce the number of people who have multiple sexual partners – and particularly concurrent multiple partners. This has been identified as a key risk factor in the spread of HIV, particularly because studies show that heterosexual sex is responsible for 94% of new infections in the country. We chose to focus on Facebook users because the uptake of social media has increased dramatically in the country with the arrival of low-cost mobile telephones. Studies conducted in the developed world have shown that online social networking technologies have been linked to increased risky sexual behaviour. Our study looked at what kind of risky sexual behaviour is displayed by people who use social network sites. The hope is that the findings could inform policy. Finding the right people Fifty four million of Facebook’s more than 1.7 billion active users live in Africa. When we conducted our study an estimated 63 720 people in Swaziland were using Facebook. This accounted for about 8.3% of the population aged 15 years and older. To evaluate the trends in a statistically significant study we needed a sample size of 2,000 people. We randomly selected 2,000 participants whom we contacted through the social media site. Only Swazi citizens who were Facebook users, 18 years or older and had displayed their full surnames publicly on the social networking site were considered. To develop a culturally sound questionnaire we conducted focus group interviews on a range of topics. These included HIV and AIDS, people’s activities on Facebook, opinions and experiences of finding sexual partners on Facebook and general sexual behaviour. This questionnaire included: - the number of sexual partners participants had had in the 12 months leading up to the study, - whether they had used a condom the last time they’d had sex, - whether they thought their steady partner had other sexual partners, - how much time they spent on Facebook each day - their sexual experience with people they met on Facebook, and - whether they would use a health information Facebook page. - Study findings Responses to the questionnaires showed that just over 80% of the men and women in the survey were sexually active. Over two thirds were between 20 and 29 years old and were not married. Many of the participants said they found it easier to initiate a romantic conversation on Facebook than face-to-face. As a result they spent more time on Facebook. A significant proportion of our study population admitted that they’d had sex with someone they had met on Facebook – and that they had had several partners at the same time. For the purposes of the study we defined “someone met on Facebook” as someone participants had spoken to on Facebook for the first time. This included people they knew as well as strangers. Studies have shown that up to a quarter of Facebook users accept friend requests from strangers Although we were able to identify important factors associated with multiple sexual partners, our study did not delve into how people used Facebook to transform relationships into sexual ones. Changing the landscape Our study also showed that Facebook has the potential to be used as a channel for health communication. Most of the participants with multiple sexual partners were willing to use a health communication Facebook page if it became available. This suggests that policies to reduce the number of multiple sexual partners in the country could include these kinds of promotions. As Facebook use among young people continues to expand people’s sexual networks are likely to increase. This potentially places young people at a high risk of HIV infection. HIV prevention programmes should therefore be designed with deliberate social media strategies.",,"['risky', 'social', 'study', 'nightmare', 'multiple', 'teen', 'partners', 'users', 'hiv', 'facebook', 'sexual', 'swaziland', 'sex', 'participants']","The backdrop to the survey was that Swaziland has identified multiple sexual partners as a major risk factor in the transmission of HIV.

The proposal won the trio the top prize in the U.K.’s TeenTech Awards, and they have already reportedly been approached by condom companies. Young people who do not like using condoms during sexual intercourse are the main cause behind high rate of unwanted babies and the spread of sexual transmitted infections such as HIV. This new condom could potentially reduce the amount of people getting sexually transmitted infections. According to Tara Haelle a Pharma and Healthcare Contributor at Forbes the boys based their idea off a common testing method that’s been in use for decades, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, reported the BBC.

However, he claims his bosses have told him the workplace is not a hospital and he should resign because they can’t afford to look after a sick person!

He said he had been given dates for disciplinary hearings four times but his employer kept postponing. “If I’m guilty why can’t they fire me?

The SunTeam approached the human resources director at his place of work, Joseph Machaba, who said it wasn’t true that Nkosinathi warned them before his clinic appointments. “We want employees suffering from chronic diseases to inform us on time so we can adjust our roster.” He also disputed Nkosinathi’s claim that he was told not to come to work until further notice.

This has left many men too afraid to seek medical consultation on sexual health matters. Your partner’s results do not always determine your status, so get tested. When you go for an HIV test, a healthcare provider will take a sample of your blood or saliva. If you went for a rapid test, you usually wait for 10 to 20 minutes before you receive your results. If the test comes back negative and you haven’t had any exposure to the virus for three months, you can be confident you’re not infected with HIV. If you test positive for HIV, you may need to go for a follow-up test to be sure you have the virus. A counsellor or healthcare provider should be able to assist you from there. Knowing your status gives you the power to protect yourself and your loved ones. We have come a long way in the field of medicine and HIV is not a death sentence.

Once you know, you can get medical treatments and counselling, if they are needed. - Even if you test positive, it’s not the end of the world, just a change in lifestyle. No more reckless sex or unhealthy living. You will need to look after yourself differently from how you did before. - It’s also easier to keep practising safe sex and make sure your sexual partners stay healthy. Regular HIV testing also means you are looking after the health of your sexual partners. If you’re HIV-positive, you can prevent the spread of the virus by taking your anti-retroviral medication correctly and using condoms. - Getting tested is easy, quick and it’s free!

In this age of HIV/Aids, it is hard to believe that some parents still consider it taboo to teach their children about the risks of sexual activity. I salute all young people who choose to abstain from sex. The fact that girls get pregnant at a young age indicates that many girls are still ignorant about the importance of using condoms. Having unprotected sex isn’t the smartest move a person can make. These people put themselves at risk of contracting or transmitting HIV/Aids. On top of this, the responsibility of raising children while they are still children themselves is a big burden. The less said the better about the young boys and sugar daddies who run away from the kids they help make. We live in a society where many kids are being raised by single mums and this is the reason some of these young mums end up abandoning their babies. These desperate mums lose focus in life and often jump from one sugar daddy to another. If parents want their daughters to succeed in life, they must teach them about the consequences of unprotected sex.

Early assessments indicate that the survey, which started in two of the provinces in December and last month, is going well. “A month into the study, more than 1 000 households have agreed to participate, which is very encouraging. “By the end of the study an estimated 22 000 households are expected to have taken part in the study. Field workers have noted challenges in accessing some houses in some neighbourhoods – particularly in the suburbs.” The 2017 HIV and Health Study is the fifth in a series of surveys undertaken by the council every few years. “This year, field workers are using more efficient electronic data-collection devices,” said Simbaya. The study will identify the prevalence of social factors and dangerous behaviours that put South Africans at risk of contracting the virus, which includes determining the HIV status of participants, the number of people who were recently affected, determine who is taking antiretroviral medicine and assessing the level of resistance to ARVs by those already on the treatment.",Health,"['total', 'study', 'households', '000', 'council', 'research', 'survey', 'hiv', 'field', 'big', 'south', 'workers']","The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) will visit 60 000 South Africans to request their participation in the country’s fifth HIV and Health study.

This would involve people using ANC-branded bicycles to venture into areas inaccessible by cars to campaign for the August 3 local government elections. “It is these blessers that are spreading HIV and Aids, because they are here, there and everywhere. And that is why we are saying down with blessers down! Down with sugar daddies, down!” He referred to President Jacob Zuma’s mention in a speech on June 16 about another phenomenon called Mavuso’s stokvel, in Hammanskraal, Pretoria. It involved men meeting women at a venue, taking them home and paying them for sex. Ramaphosa warned that such practices helped spread HIV/Aids. “Stay away from Mavuso’s,” pleaded Ramaphosa. Sex talk Earlier on Friday, he announced an HIV campaign in Pietermaritzburg, where Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi presented a new condom called Max. He told his Umlazi audience that some men had stopped using condoms. “They want to have unprotected sex. Dr Motsoaledi said people told the government that the Choice condoms did not give them pleasure. They make noise when you use them and they do not have a scent. “So comrade Motsoaledi and the department spoke to scientists and we now have a new condom out called Max. “You will be satisfied when you use Max. It also has maximum protection and a scent. They say the strawberry one is the best, better than banana, I even carry my own pack of Max condoms,” he said, to the crowd’s amusement. Ramaphosa, who sometimes laughed during his sex talk, told his audience to start using condoms again. “Tell the young children to abstain from sexual relations because it is much better when you are older. HIV must not spread.” He said it was the government’s responsibility to speak about difficult issues like HIV/Aids. As the party campaigned in the country, municipalities and mayors should lead the campaign. The deputy president, NEC member Motsoaledi and Bheki Cele, and ANC provincial leaders Sihle Zikalala, Super Zuma and Mluleki Ndobe charmed and entertained the crowd by dancing. http://www.news24.com/Elections/News/blessers-spreading-hivaids-ramaphosa-warns-20160625",National,"['motsoaledi', 'ramaphosa', 'told', 'using', 'condoms', 'blessers', 'young', 'campaign', 'president', 'spreading', 'hiv', 'called', 'hivaids', 'women']","YOUNG women must stay away from “blessers” because they are spreading HIV/Aids, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said yesterday. “It is a man that goes around giving money to young women and buys them airtime. “Some of them even buy women cars.”They were also known as sugar daddies and a website had been created to connect young women with such men. “It is these blessers that are spreading HIV and Aids, because they are here, there and everywhere.

WEAPON AGAINST HIV!,A LOT more work needs to be done to prevent HIV/Aids infections among male same-sex partners.,,2017/04/05,DailySun,"A LOT more work needs to be done to prevent HIV/Aids infections among male same-sex partners. Experts, researchers and policy makers recently gathered for a meeting hosted by Evidence for HIV Prevention in Southern Africa in Joburg, which was aimed at “men who have sex with men” (MSM). Dr James McIntyre, chief executive officer at Anova Health Institute, whose organisation provides a range of HIV prevention services for MSM and other vulnerable groups in Mzansi, said they were rolling out “pre-exposure prophylaxis” programmes in Joburg and Cape Town clinics so MSM received the same sexual healthcare services like any other person in Mzansi. “Even though the rights of MSM are protected by the Mzansi Constitution, more needs to be done before the prophylaxis can be made widely available.” The prophylaxis is a key tool in the HIV prevention strategy for strengthening sexual health-care services. The pill, which prevents HIV infection by up to 100% when used properly by uninfected people, has been licensed in Mzansi and Kenya. Evidence from a range of international clinical trials shows that pre-exposure meds are safe and effective, but also do not make users vulnerable to other sexual transmitted infections. Dr Kevin Rebe, a clinician at Anova Health Institute, said Mzansi needed to train its healthcare workers to make sure that clinics are “MSM-friendly”. Kevin said they were training their staff from over 250 clinics nationwide to be able to service MSMs. Gavin Reid from the International HIV/Aids Alliance revealed the successful strategies of the Sexual Health and Rights Programme for working in MSM-hostile environments. He said that since 2012 they had been able to provide HIV services to over 15 000 MSM in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe .",Health,"['prevention', 'msm', 'weapon', 'mzansi', 'prophylaxis', 'sexual', 'hiv', 'clinics', 'services', 'health', 'healthcare']","Experts, researchers and policy makers recently gathered for a meeting hosted by Evidence for HIV Prevention in Southern Africa in Joburg, which was aimed at “men who have sex with men” (MSM). “Even though the rights of MSM are protected by the Mzansi Constitution, more needs to be done before the prophylaxis can be made widely available.”The prophylaxis is a key tool in the HIV prevention strategy for strengthening sexual health-care services.

He said his teeth have been falling out of his mouth since he was diagnosed with HIV in 2003.

#RedRibbonFriday: PREVENTION IS MY RESPONSIBILITY!,Mzansi has made significant progress in the efforts to respond to HIV.,,2017/12/01,DailySun,"Mzansi has made significant progress in the efforts to respond to HIV. But have not done so well in protecting people from HIV infection. According to the South African National Aids Council (SANAC) about 270 000 people became newly infected with HIV in 2016 alone. Hence there is a call to all South Africans to get behind World AIDS Day 2017 and to put the prevention of HIV back on the agenda. Mzansi is urged to join the rest of the Word in observing world aids day. World AIDS day is observed on December 1 and the 2017 theme is “It is my right to know my status. Prevention is my responsibility”. The theme encourages South Africans to make their actions count and to take personal and collective responsibility to prevent new HIV and TB infections. SANAC said it wants to encourage conversations among South Africans to respond to critical questions such as: What is your Responsibility? What can you do to prevent the spread of HIV and TB infections? Every Friday, since November 10, all South Africans were encouraged to wear a red ribbon, take a picture and share it on social media using the hashtag #RedRibbonFriday, organize HIV testing services in their workplace and raise awareness about the prevention of HIV and TB. ""The red ribbon has become a symbol of solidarity and commitment to the fight against HIV and AIDS. It is a symbol worn to recognise and honour individuals, loved ones, family members, friends and colleagues who are living positively with HIV, and honour the memory of those who had passed on due to AIDS–related conditions. HIV is not over. ""It’s time to get everyone to play their role in preventing HIV and TB. Through #RedRibbonFriday we can encourage millions of South Africans to be conscious about the need to prevent the spread of HIV and TB,"" said SANAC. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will, in his capacity as Chairperson SANAC, address the World Aids Day national commemoration event at the Walter Sisulu University Stadium, Mthatha, Eastern Cape on Friday. In a recorded message, Deputy President Ramaphosa said: “This is a time to remember those that we have lost to the twin epidemics of AIDS and Tuberculosis. It is also a time to reflect on the extraordinary progress that we’ve made as a nation in the fight against AIDS and TB.

The department said it monitored the numbers through clinic and hospital records and had come across even more dire figures.

The department further said that it did not want to speculate about what the causes of the high pregnancy and infection rates among minors and teenagers were.

AIDS CRISIS IN SIERRA LEONE!,THE people of Sierra Leone are just getting over the deadly mudslides that killed more than 500 people.,,2017/08/26,DailySun,"FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE THE people of Sierra Leone are just getting over the deadly mudslides that killed more than 500 people. The period of national mourning following the tragic flooding and mudslides in the capital Freetown and surrounding areas is officially over. At least 500 people have been killed, with the number expected to rise. A mass burial for 300 people has been held. About 200 people living with HIV and their families were affected – 54 of them were among the dead. United Nations Aids authorities are worried that people living with HIV and people at higher risk of HIV infection often become more vulnerable in times of emergency. That’s because of a lack of prioritisation of their needs, lack of prevention services and disruption of treatment. In addition, people living with HIV, especially with weakened immune systems, are at higher risk of contracting malaria and water-borne diseases. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the UN’s priority has been to ensure the continuation and scale-up of anti-retroviral therapy services. It must also generate strategic information for fund-raising and facilitate access for people living with HIV to food and non-food resources. The UN’s Michel Sidibe said the crisis had put into sharp focus the fragility of Sierra Leone’s post-Ebola social safety nets. “It’s critical that the resources required for the response to HIV be included in the emergency fund-raising appeals and that the country’s HIV catch-up plan be financed and implemented effectively,” said Sidibe.

WATCH OUT FOR THE SILENT KILLER!,MORE work needs to be done to control HIV and TB in Mzansi.,,,,"MORE work needs to be done to control HIV and TB in Mzansi. As we look to World TB Day on 24 March, we have to acknow­ledge the effect of TB, which, according to Statistics South Africa, killed over 33 000 South Africans last year. Aids Healthcare Foundation, the largest international non-profit HIV/Aids healthcare provider, said taking medication on time and not skipping days helps slow the disease. The theme for this year is “Unite to End TB: Leave no-one behind”. Larissa Klazinga, Southern Africa regional policy and advocacy manager for the Aids foundation, said the amount of people dying of TB in Mzansi are increasing. “The numbers clearly show that we aren’t winning the war against TB. This is especially devastating when TB and HIV exist as deadly co-infections.” Larissa said TB and HIV co-infection happens when an HIV-positive person is also infected with latent or active TB. She said untreated TB can lead to MDR-TB and XDR-TB, which is made worse if the patient has HIV. MDR-TB or multi-drug resistant TB is a tougher version of the TB bacteria. It is largely immune to at least two of the most powerful anti-TB medications. She said patient malnutrition and lack of transport was another reason people died from TB. “We forget that people living in rural and sub-rural areas may have to catch one, two or even three taxis to get to a clinic or hospital, which may cost R40 to R80 for a one-way trip.” To limit your risk of contracting TB, avoid exposing yourself to people who are known to have active TB. If this is unavoidable, take protective measurements such as wearing a face mask. - When traveling with public transportation – such as trains, buses and taxis – make sure to always open the windows so fresh air can flow in and out. - Have good ventilation at home and at work by opening windows – TB spreads in closed rooms! - Lead a healthy lifestyle by eating a well-balanced diet of fruit, vegetables and lean protein.

MOTSOALEDI BLAMES LACK OF SEX EDUCATION!,"Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said on Tuesday he was not surprised by the results of a national HIV survey, lamenting the lack of sexual and reproductive education at schools.",,2018/07/18,DailySun,"Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said on Tuesday he was not surprised by the results of a national HIV survey, lamenting the lack of sexual and reproductive education at schools. The South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication Survey of 2017 showed that while there has been a significant decline in South Africa’s HIV infection rate, young people are still at risk. The survey found that there were an estimated 231 100 new infections in 2017, with infections among young people having risen by 7.9% – with females at three-times higher risk than their male counterparts. Rejected by parents Motsoaledi recalled how he tried to introduce sexual and reproductive education at schools several years ago, only to have the idea vehemently rejected by parents and unions. He said they were only allowed to do immunisation, eye testing and alcohol and drug campaigns. “They said no sexual and reproductive rights education, saying that children are too young for that. I want to tell parents that kids these days know way too much. Facts are out there pointing to this,” he said, adding that social media was a contributing factor leading children to experiment. The results of the survey were revealed in Pretoria – this is the fifth survey 2002. It is a population-based cross sectional survey of households in South Africa conducted between January and December 2017. Over 33 000 people were interviewed and almost 24 000 agreed to be tested for HIV. Progress made with ART The study further revealed that in 2017 there were 7.9 million people living with HIV in South Africa and over 60% or an estimated 4.4 million people were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). It was also found that the viral suppression was 87.3% among people living with HIV, with females generally being more likely to be virally suppressed than males among those aged between 15 and 64 years. “This suggests that the progress is being made in increasing ART coverage. But more still needs to be done,” said Dr Sizulu Moyo of the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) which conducted the survey. Furthermore, although viral suppression is high among those on ART, not everyone who is living with HIV is on treatment, and subsequently only 62.3% of all people living with HIV, irrespective of treatment, were found to be virally suppressed. The study also found that HIV prevalence peaked at 35 to 39 years of age for females and 45 to 49 years of age for males. Kwa-Zulu Natal was found to be the leading province in HIV prevalence, followed by the Free State and the Eastern Cape. The three least affected provinces were Limpopo, Northern Cape and Western Cape. We need to do more It was found that the country had made some progress in addressing the HIV epidemic. In terms of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, the study found that 85% of people living with HIV have tested for the virus and know their positive status, with 71% of this sub-group on ART, and 86% of those on ART being virally suppressed. “This shows that the country has made a significant progress towards reaching the 90-90-90 targets,” said Dr Edmore Marinda of the Research Use and Impact Assessment (RIA) Unit in the HSRC. Medical male circumcision was lauded as one of the best interventions to reduce HIV among males. The increase in the number of men who are medically circumcised rose from 18.6% in 2012 to 30.8% in 2017. “Although encouraging, this finding highlights a need to continue promoting and creating a demand for voluntary medical male circumcision with an immediate target among males in the 15-to-34 year old age group,” said Professor Leickness Simbayi, the overall principal investigator.

SUGAR DADDIES WILL JUST MAKE YOU BITTER,"WHEN Anna Ngoepe was diagnosed with HIV in 1988, the mother of two from extension 3 in Nelmapius, Tshwane, was devastated.",,2017/12/01,DailySun,"WHEN Anna Ngoepe was diagnosed with HIV in 1988, the mother of two from extension 3 in Nelmapius, Tshwane, was devastated. Back then the disease wasn’t understood and people who were HIV positive were shunned by society. Anna tried to take her own life several times by throwing herself in front of moving cars, but they all stopped in time. It was only after getting counselling from an infected person that she accepted her situation. And that changed her life. It encouraged her to help in the fight against the dreaded disease. Anna told Daily Sun: “At the time when I was diagnosed, people would not eat with you, touch you, or shake your hand. “It was hard on HIV-positive people.” She said counselling helped her to deal with her situation and she decided to lead a healthy lifestyle. She disclosed after her husband died in 2013. “I decided to make it my mission to educate people about the disease,” she said. She invited her neighbours and told them about her disease. “I also volunteered at local clinics to counsel newly diagnosed people,” she said.

NEW HIV VACCINE COULD SAVE MILLIONS,"TODAY is World Aids Day, which aims to raise awareness about HIV and remember all those who have lost their lives to the virus.",,2016/12/01,DailySun,"TODAY is World Aids Day, which aims to raise awareness about HIV and remember all those who have lost their lives to the virus. According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, more than six million people are living with HIV in South Africa. Mzansi’s HIV treatment programme is the largest in the world with 3,4 million people receiving ARVs from the health department. Thanks to the institute, there might be hope on the horizon. It is involved in a large test of a HIV vaccine trial called HVTN 702 across the country. If successful, the trial will produce the world’s first HIV vaccine and save millions of lives. In KZN, the start of the trial has brought hope to community care workers across the province. Health community workers from around Durban this week attended the launch of the HVTN 702 trial at the Medical Research Council’s branch in Verulam. The trial will see the vaccine, known as RV144, being tested on 5 400 people for the next 12 months. Community health worker, Ritta Bantjies (67) from Waterloo said: “I’m excited this was launched just before the commemoration of World Aids Day. This is a reminder that we have lost many people to this virus. If this vaccine passes I’m sure we will live to see an Aids-free generation.” Dr Anamika Premrajh of the South African Medical Research Council said: “This is one of the vaccines researchers came up with after studying the particular type of HIV this country has.”",National,"['millions', 'trial', 'million', 'save', 'vaccine', 'research', 'medical', 'lost', 'hiv', 'south', 'world', 'workers']","According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, more than six million people are living with HIV in South Africa.

SAFETY TIPS FOR MAGOSHAS!,"ON MONDAY the South African National Aids Council hosted its National Sex Workers symposium.   The conference was held at Turbine Hall in Newtown, Joburg.",,2015/01/14,DailySun,"ON MONDAY the South African National Aids Council hosted its National Sex Workers symposium. The conference was held at Turbine Hall in Newtown, Joburg. The aim was to introduce a programme that caters to the needs of sex workers, who are more vulnerable to HIV infection than most people. Special prevention and treatment interventions suited to their particular needs and circumstances are necessary. Deputy minister of social development Hendrietta Bogapane-Zulu said: “The aim of the programme is to reduce the transmission of HIV to sex workers and their clients.” She added that it also aims to ensure good access to social services and healthcare for sex workers, and to tackle human rights issues such as abuse that make them vulnerable to HIV infection. The programme was introduced as a council flagship project and of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, TB and malaria. It was financed by a grant of about R100 million from the Global Fund to Fight Aids. Council CEO Dr Fareed Abdullah said: “It not only adresses prevention of HIV and appropriate healthcare for those living with HIV, it also tackles the difficult question of access to justice for sex workers.” He said the introduction of a national HIV programme for sex workers finally plugs a gaping hole in the country’s response to the epidemic. Abdullah said about 60% of Mzansi’s estimated 150 000 sex workers are HIV-positive. “How can you talk about HIV prevention and not talk about sex work, knowing HIV transmission involves sex? “Sex workers, their non-commercial partners and their clients account for between six and 11% of all new infections in South Africa.” He said general HIV services did not meet the special needs of sex workers. “Their work exposes them to a hugely increased risk of getting infected. It is often dangerous and lonely and carries a heavy social stigma as it is illegal.” Abdullah said the programme would be initiated through a network of NGOs under the leadership of the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy task force. Kholi Buthelezi, the national co-ordinator for the national sex worker movement Sisonke said: “Our movement was formed in 2003. We were tired of being mistreated.” She said sex workers have a real stake in the planning and running of the programme. “It is up to us to continue to organise and raise our voices louder for the changes we need to see in the legislation and policies affecting sex workers.” Buthelezi said they were doing this to protect themselves, their health, families and their futures. “We are doing something positive to fight the HIV epidemic for the nation as a whole.”",,"['fight', 'social', 'needs', 'safety', 'prevention', 'national', 'hiv', 'tips', 'programme', 'magoshas', 'work', 'sex', 'workers']","ON MONDAY the South African National Aids Council hosted its National Sex Workers symposium.

MZANSI PROSTITUTES DON'T PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST HIV!,SCIENTIFIC studies have shown that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in protecting people from HIV during both anal and vaginal sex.,,,,"SCIENTIFIC studies have shown that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in protecting people from HIV during both anal and vaginal sex. Sex workers should be more concerned about protecting themselves. ~ Despite being offered a daily pill to protect them from HIV, almost three-quarters of women sex workers had stopped taking the pills after a year. This is according to a study published in the PLoS journal last week, conducted by the TAPS Demonstration Study. Only one pill The study tested almost 700 women, and says that the average woman was “married or had a steady partner, worked in brothels, and were born in Zimbabwe”. Almost half of the women tested were HIV positive (341). Of these, 139 decided to go on ARVs. Around 60% of them were still on the medication after a year. The sex workers who tested HIV negative (351) were offered one pill, Truvada, to take every day to protect them from the virus. 219 women accepted the offer. But a year later, only 49 women were still taking Truvada – although none of those still on the pills had contracted HIV. “The final retention rate was lower than we would like. However, there were no seroconversions among those women who stayed on the PrEP arm,” said Robyn Eakle, a senior researcher from the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (WRHI), which was part of the study. Infections occur in three groups Using ARVs to protect people from HIV is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Scientific studies have already shown that Truvada is effective in protecting people from HIV during both anal and vaginal sex. The Department of Health decided to offer PrEP at certain clinics that serve sex workers, despite being under pressure to provide ARVs as prevention more widely available. Around half of the world’s new HIV infections occur in three groups – sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users. In South Africa, HIV rates are very high among sex workers. “We found that many of the women cycled in and out of care as they felt more or less at risk, as reported by them,” said Eackle. “Some reported difficulties getting to the clinic at times due to work, family or other conflicts such as school.” Eakle said this and other studies “suggest that PrEP use is likely to be cyclical for many women, which is fine as they develop new habits for remaining negative. Perhaps the act of engagement in care in the larger picture is what will keep them negative.” Sex work still a crime Sex work is illegal in South Africa, which makes it hard for health workers to reach and treat them. But Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told Health-e that “South Africa does not need to wait for laws to decriminalise sex workers before protecting this sector from HIV”. The country’s National Strategic Plan on HIV and TB recommends decriminalising sex work, but last year the SA Law Commission recommended that sex work remain illegal. “The issue of sex workers is not just for the Minister of Health but involves other Ministers,” said Motsoaledi. “India has not decriminalised sex workers, but health workers in Bangalore are working very openly with sex workers and police are not arresting them.” – Health-e News.",,"['work', 'prep', 'women', 'tested', 'mzansi', 'protect', 'protecting', 'truvada', 'hiv', 'health', 'dont', 'prostitutes', 'sex', 'workers']","~Despite being offered a daily pill to protect them from HIV, almost three-quarters of women sex workers had stopped taking the pills after a year.

They also learn how to really talk about the issues facing them. The Young Reporters featured in this gallery are from Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Their project with Children’s Radio Foundation (CRF), community station Radio Zibonele and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) is just one of 74 youth radio projects CRF runs in six African countries. This Khayelitsha project was started by MSF and CRF in 2012 in response to some shocking HIV facts in the kasi. It found that 28% of the township’s population was HIV positive. It found that 70% of infected adolescents were not accessing free treatment, with 60% of these “lost to care” after testing positive. They needed a way to get these youth back into care, and to start talking openly about this critical health issue. Radio was one strategy to doing just that. In other CRF projects young reporters explore the many sides of challenging issues they face, from HIV/AIDS to education, the environment and teen relationships. In CRF’s Young Reporters Network, 300 reporters have been trained, involving 18 community radio stations across Mzansi.

YOUNG PEOPLE DON’T USE CONDOMS!,Young people who do not like using condoms during sexual intercourse in Vhembe are the main cause behind high rate of unwanted babies and the spread of sexual transmitted infections such as HIV.,,2018/07/02,DailySun,"Young people who do not like using condoms during sexual intercourse in Vhembe are the main cause behind high rate of unwanted babies and the spread of sexual transmitted infections such as HIV. These are the views of Tinyiko Nkanyane of Love Life. She says many rural youth still do not understand the importance of using condoms during sexual encounters, despite the free availability of condoms. Condoms are there for free “We have got a high rate of teenage pregnancies, which is a worrying factor because most of those babies are unwanted. Condoms are all over, but people still choose not to use them. Everywhere we go – be it in public toilets, government buildings, clinics, hospitals and libraries – condoms are there for free. Those condoms are made for us to protect ourselves against sexual transmitted viruses and unwanted pregnancies,” said Nkanyane, addressing more than one hundred young people at the Thulamela library hall recently. Nkanyane said it pains her when she sees young people not respecting their bodies as they end up being infected by various diseases. “It is our duty as young people to protect ourselves from HIV/Aids. We must respect our bodies and stop sleeping around without using protection, which also results in most of us having diseases and unwanted babies. Young people are dying because of cervical cancer due to lack of knowledge regarding their sex lives. It is our duty to go for regular check-ups and educate ourselves about sexual issues,” she said. Youth are key She also appealed with young people not discriminate against those who are living with HIV/Aids as it derails the fight against the virus. “No one chose to be HIV positive, hence we have to support those who are already living with the virus without discriminating them as they are people like us,” she said. Gladys Matshomo, an official from the Vhembe district Department of Health said that the youth are key to the fight against the spread of HIV/Aids. “HIV is here to stay if we don’t fight against it. Our young people should stop engaging themselves in unprotected sexual relationships at an early age. Abstaining is important in our fight against the spread of HIV. Those who are unable to abstain from sexual activities must make condoms their number one friend,” said Matshomo.

'PROTECT YOURSELF OR ABSTAIN - THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS',"MY name is Innocent* and I am 20 years old, a second year electrical infrastructure and construction student in Durban.",,2017/11/20,DailySun,"MY name is Innocent* and I am 20 years old, a second year electrical infrastructure and construction student in Durban. I attended the launch of the youth-friendly clinic in Lamontville, Durban which makes sure that young people have their own space at the health centre, where they can talk about things like HIV and STIs and pregnancy. I don’t usually go to the clinic but I do attend community events that have anything to do with HIV because it is such a serious issue. At school I used to attend such events about HIV and share the information I got there with other guys. As youth, we do know about condoms and prevention but many young guys say using condoms is boring. I tell them “that’s too bad but you still need to protect yourself and your partner”. They must protect themselves or abstain. That is the choice. The good part about this clinic is that there is a space where youth can just hang out and chill, chat to each other. It is easier when we talk to our own age group – talking to older people is like speaking to our parents. Sometimes it is easier to talk to a lady nurse than to a man. It would be embarrassing to talk to a man about STIs, really. Some of the issues that go with HIV, like beating girls, is not in my age group. That is done by older men. For us, if a girl says “no” then it is “no”. We have to respect that. As a guy, if you have a partner then everyone can see that and it makes you feel good. If guys see a girl they like they will tell their friends “I am going to get her.” Then they put each other under pressure to do whatever it takes to impress her. Other guys will laugh at you if you fail and then you feel bad. But we are put under pressure as students because girls get things from older guys. Girls want to be taken to nice places and bought nice things. Some girls say they aren’t after that and that they love you. At first you can believe it then you realise they also want those expensive things the blessers can buy. As a student it is hard but I can only share the little pressure I have. If it’s not enough for her, then I must leave her. But sometimes it is hard emotionally, because it is not just about sex. Love is love. *Surname withheld",Health,"['pressure', 'talk', 'girls', 'things', 'options', 'protect', 'older', 'young', 'abstain', 'youth', 'hiv', 'clinic', 'guys']","At school I used to attend such events about HIV and share the information I got there with other guys.

BLESSER BOMBSHELL!,TEENAGE girls are more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group!.,,2016/07/15,DailySun,"TEENAGE girls are more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group! Researchers have yet to find out why girls are still more vulnerable to HIV than boys. However, it is believed young girls tend to have sex very early – and with older men. Last month, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, chairman of the South African National Aids Council, called on sugar daddies and blessers to stop dating young girls. According to the 2012 South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence and Behaviour Survey, more needs to be done to challenge society’s acceptance of sugar daddy and blessers’ relationships, as they are associated with financial gain. “It is necessary to ensure young women are empowered and have access to education and employment to break the cycle of poverty,” read the survey. Researcher Sintha Chiumia said the survey tested more than 3 000 teenagers between the ages on 15 and 19 for HIV. It was discovered that 5,6% of the young girls were estimated to be HIV-positive, compared with 0,7% of boys in the same age group. Professor Olive Shisana, deputy chairwoman of the International Aids Conference, told Africa Check, a non-profit organisation that promotes accuracy in public debate and the media, that the higher prevalence among 15 to 19-year-old girls is the result of young girls having sex at an earlier age than boys in the same age group. She said: “The tendency in South Africa is for young women to have sex with men at least five years older, whose chances of being HIV-positive are higher. “One can see it in the fact that HIV prevalence among men aged between 20 and 24 was an estimated 5,1%, which was closer to the prevalence among the girls aged between 15 and 19.” Although the results of the research will be released at the International Aids Conference next week, research director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, Professor Sinead Delany-Moretlwe, told Africa Check that young girls are affected by immature genital tracts.",National,"['aids', 'girls', 'hivpositive', 'age', 'young', 'bombshell', 'hiv', 'boys', 'blesser', 'sex', 'south', 'prevalence']","TEENAGE girls are more likely to be HIV-positive than boys in the same age group!

‘LISTEN TO ME: TB CAN BE BEATEN’,,,2018/12/01,DailySun,"LEJWELEPUTSWA District in Free State Province lies amid the famed goldfields. Like the rest of the country, the region is grappling with unemployment, poverty and the effects of the AIDS epidemic. A group of health workers working there are determined no more lives are needlessly lost and that rural patients receive excellent service. Health Systems Trust Nurse Clinician Nthabeleng Lefu embodies this approach. As ‘Sister Lefu’ enters Phahameng Clinic, patients waiting on benches hail her as an old friend. Nozmanga Dikano (36) bounds happily across to Sister Lefu, saying: “Do you see how fat I am now, Sister?” Dikano was diagnosed with HIV in 2001 and was treated with Bactrim to prevent opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). In 2007 she was also diagnosed with TB and started on ART. “In 2010 I defaulted on treatment because I was working as a domestic in Bloemfontein and my boss wouldn’t let me go to the clinic to fetch my medicine. I’m sorry to say that I defaulted for 10 years until I had a baby in 2017. “By the time they tested me in the antenatal screening, my CD4 count was at 111 ? it is supposed to be at least 350. “I already had three children and they are all HIV-negative, so they gave me Nevirapine to prevent me transmitting the virus to my baby during childbirth.” Dikano said that after the birth she felt extremely weak and tired, unable to walk more than a few steps and struggling to even swallow water. “I thought it was because I had had a Caesarean section. I was admitted to the provincial hospital for three weeks for low blood pressure, because the X-rays didn’t show TB. I told the doctor that I’d had TB before and recognised this feeling, but he ignored me and just changed my ARVs. “I wasn’t getting better so I discharged myself and came here to my local clinic to tell them what happened. The next day they sent Sister Nthabeleng to my house to fetch me. My face was swollen like a football and I was very dehydrated. My feet were icy cold and I couldn’t sleep at all. I thought, ‘This is it. I am dying’. “She examined me and said she thought it was TB, even if it hadn’t shown up on the X-rays.” Dikano was placed on TB treatment and rapidly improved. “Within a week I was feeling much better. I have just one more month of treatment, and my baby is on INH to prevent him contracting TB.” Dikano’s four children, ranging in age from infancy to 18 years old, were so thrilled to see their mother improve that they soon joined in ensuring that she stuck to her treatment. Dikano says that stigma around TB is in some ways worse than the stigma of HIV. “I have been open about my HIV status for 20 years and because I always looked fine, no one was worried. But when I got really sick with TB, even my own siblings wouldn’t allow me to stay with them because they were afraid I would infect their children. They know it is highly contagious and I think I looked so bad that it frightened them.” Now feeling as if she has a new lease on life, Dikano is a passionate advocate for education on TB and HIV: “I speak to everyone who will listen about TB and HIV. I want to climb to the top of the mountain and tell the world that TB can be beaten.” To learn more about TB testing and treatment go to http://betteroffknowing.org.za/get-tested/tb/",Health,"['beaten', 'treatment', 'thought', 'children', 'listen', 'prevent', 'lefu', 'sister', 'hiv', 'tb', 'clinic', 'feeling']","As ‘Sister Lefu’ enters Phahameng Clinic, patients waiting on benches hail her as an old friend.

ON THE ROAD FOR MEN’S HEALTH,THIS month we will be looking at men’s health - and how men can take care of themselves and others.,,2017/11/06,DailySun,"THIS month we will be looking at men’s health - and how men can take care of themselves and others. We want to help men learn more about preventing HIV, safeguarding their health, and setting goals for their futures. We know men are less likely to seek medical help and also that untreated mental health issues – such as depression - lead to a high suicide rate in men. We want to share information and provide resources to men who are not sure where to ask. Heres a story from someone on the front line of providing mobile health services. Nhlanhla Zuma works for Health Systems Trust, an NGO which works to strengthen the public health system: My name is Nhlanhla Zuma and I am 41 years old. I work as a driver mobiliser in KwaZulu Natal’s Umgungundlovu district. I drive the mobile testing unit and we encourage people to come for HIV testing. I use a loudhailer as we drive around, to call on people in the community to find out their status. We focus on high risk areas like taverns and truck stops – for these people it is hard to get away from work and go to the clinic as they are always on the road. Instead we take these services to the people, when and where they need it. This makes the community feel that their health is also valued. We work from 11am to 7pm each day so that people can come to us after work. The most important thing is that we take the services to the community, when and where they need it. This mobile I am driving has two rooms inside, where people can be tested not just for HIV but also for TB, STIs and diabetes. Each mobile tests on average 12 people per day. At the truck stops our clients are mostly male. The truth is, some men are cowards, so they will send their wives to test and refuse to be tested themselves. This is what we call “testing by proxy” and it is dangerous, because they think that if their partner is negative, then they are as well. We really need a lot of education in the community, especially for men, so they can learn about HIV, condom usage, male circumcision and other health issues.

Don’t delay starting with ARVs,PEOPLE who have tested positive for HIV are urged to take ARVs immediately.,,2016/09/22,DailySun,"PEOPLE who have tested positive for HIV are urged to take ARVs immediately. This will help keep non-Aids diseases from developing and it is better than waiting until your CD4 count drops below 500 cells. Dr Johan Pretorius, chief executive of medical scheme administrator and managed care provider Universal Healthcare, said he welcomed the Department of Health’s implementation of guidelines that allowed people to have access to ARVs. The development brings Mzansi in line with international best practice of HIV care. Universal Healthcare has worked closely with doctors who implemented these new guidelines. They have already reached 82% of HIV-positive patients to receive ARVs. The department’s new policy on ARV treatment was announced by Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi in May this year, following the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) international recommendations. He said WHO based its guidelines on the results of a number of clinical studies and the controlled, randomised Temprano trial conducted in western Africa, which found that a strong link exists between starting ARV treatment early and reduced severity of HIV morbidity. People are encouraged to go to their nearest clinics to be tested for HIV.

WE NEED TO END TOXIC BLESSER SEX,THE numbers of people with HIV/Aids will never drop as long as there are people who recklessly spread the virus.,,2018/03/10,DailySun,"THE numbers of people with HIV/Aids will never drop as long as there are people who recklessly spread the virus. Hermina Manjekana-Dyeshana is the programme specialist of maternal, newborn, child and women’s health at Right to Care. She said no matter what government did to prevent HIV/Aids by providing quality health services and contraceptive methods to the people, people like blessers spread the virus. “We know there are a large numbers of older HIV-infected men who have infected their partners but most of these men don’t know their HIV status because they choose to remain untested.” Manjekana-Dyeshana said almost a third of new HIV infections in Mzansi occur among 15 to 24 year-olds, but adolescent girls are eight times more likely to be HIV-positive than boys of the same age. Those who have been recently diagnosed with HIV have extremely high viral loads. This means that it is likely that the infecting blessers are not treated and have not entered the healthcare system. Right to Care is calling on South African health workers to use strategies that focus on people at risk as well as blessers who are driving the high HIV infection rates up among young women. While they cannot isolate blessers – also called players, plyers and sugar daddies – from the public, it is important that they are tested and learn their HIV status. She said blessers enter into sexual relationships with girls by offering money, cellphones, airtime, clothes and other luxuries. The blessers, who are often married, make an already massive healthcare problem worse.” Right to Care programmes work to reach men who may be blessers but she said the power play of money and poverty also means young women are forced to consent to unprotected sex to be able to afford even basic items. The HIV problem is the most immediate but there is also the concern of unwanted pregnancies. Manjekana-Dyeshana said that blessers alone were not the problem, but a symptom. The problem is that many younh people lacked a decent education and facilities. “We are pushing for youth-friendly facilities and services – healthcare facilities that people can enter without being judged by the nursing staff and older patients.”",Health,"['numbers', 'spread', 'services', 'toxic', 'blesser', 'problem', 'men', 'end', 'blessers', 'young', 'hiv', 'health', 'need', 'sex', 'healthcare']","THE numbers of people with HIV/Aids will never drop as long as there are people who recklessly spread the virus.

Rape in Mzansi is a daily occurrence,A broken healthcare system means that rape survivors may continue to carry the burden of rape both physically and psychologically. The stories in the graphic illustration below were inspired by real testimonies of rape survivors sent in to Health-e News using the Izwi Lami SMS line.,,,,"According to the 2015/2016 South African Police Service figures released in September last year, reported rape cases stood at 42,496. This does not include the unimaginably alarming number of cases that go unreported, deterred by the 8% conviction rate of rapists, or notorious disregard of the SAPS towards sexual violence survivors. Fear of not being believed, or being told that what they survived does not actually amount to rape, means many survivors do not know they are entitled to access both justice, but also medical care to prevent unwanted pregnancies, HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. In a report published by Doctor Without Borders (MSF) that profiled the sexual violence in Rustenburg, it was found that 95% of survivors did not tell a health professional of the incident, while only half were aware that HIV could be prevented after rape. In another more recent study, MSF conducted a nationwide telephonic mapping of designated healthcare facilities to examine what healthcare gaps existed for survivors of sexual violence in South Africa. According to the Department of Health, there are 265 public healthcare facilities across all provinces that should be providing medical and psychological care to survivors of sexual violence. Of the 265 designated facilities, 63% participated in an interview. It was found that only 26,7% of facilities provide the comprehensive package of care for survivors. This could be why one third of survivors interviewed in the Rustenburg study needed abortions after being raped. This means the trauma of being raped is repeated both in the pursuit of justice, and in the pursuit of basic access to healthcare post-rape. Only 27% percent reported access to a psychologist, raising concerns about the ripple effect of trauma and mental health issues throughout South African society. Additionally, for young South African women, gender based violence attributes to approximately 20-25 percent of new HIV infections. This is exacerbated by poor healthcare services for survivors. A woman, for example, who cannot access antiretrovirals after a rape is at risk of having her trauma revisited through her life. Health-e’s Izwi Lami campaign provides a free and anonymous SMS service to survivors, allowing them to share their stories of survival, access counseling services and sign a petition calling for packages of care in all 24 hour healthcare facilities. Largely, it has brought rape survivors’ testimonies into the mainstream media conversation in an attempt to shatter the normalisation of rape, and its long term health implications, across the country.",,"['daily', 'care', 'violence', 'occurrence', 'mzansi', 'survivors', 'sexual', 'health', 'rape', 'access', 'south', 'healthcare', 'facilities']","According to the 2015/2016 South African Police Service figures released in September last year, reported rape cases stood at 42,496.

SOMIZI IS BIGGER THAN THE DISEASE!,Somizi on his brand new book.,,2017/06/25,DailySun,"""There I was, my life was perfect in the eyes of everyone, but inside I was dying. How was I going to deal with this; is there a cure for it? There is no cure for it. Do I take treatment and survive it or am I going to die within six months?” writes socialite Somizi Mhlongo in his memoir, Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit. He went on an emotional roller coaster after a doctor, giving him the results of medical tests, told him that all was clear, except for one terminal disease. ""To this day I haven’t had the courage or the need to say which one it is between cancer, HIV and diabetes,"" Mhlongo (44) says. Everyone around him said he only had a month to live, but God had other plans for him, he says. Even though he has been living with the terminal disease for some time, Mhlongo is still positive about life and hasn’t allowed it to dampen his spirits. He says writing the emotional book didn’t weigh heavily on him, but he wonders whether someone not as strong as he is would manage. “I can’t believe that to this day I’ve pulled through. Everybody had given up. Everyone was saying ‘lona [this one] he’s got a month to live’,” Mhlongo told City Press this week ahead of the launch of his memoir on Wednesday. His book will also be available at Exclusive Books stores on Wednesday. “If I managed to survive this, nothing is going to be hard for me anymore in this world,” he says. He first thought about writing a tell-all book about six years ago when everything around him came crashing down. That, along with musician and actor Brian Temba’s hit single, Dominoes, inspired the book’s title. Mhlongo says he felt it was the perfect title to sum up his life’s journey. “Since I was born I’ve been breaking down walls, hurdles and obstacles ... they fall like dominoes. My story is that of walls falling like dominoes,” he says. Mhlongo recalls feeling very ill a few years ago and deciding to go for a medical check-up “just to be aware of what was going on” with his health. Six months after he was diagnosed, he decided to cultivate a positive mind-set and did some research on the disease. He also decided to strive to balance his life as an entertainer and the reality of his medical condition. “Showbiz life was great but inside I was dying,” he says. Mhlongo says he put on a brave face in public spaces to mask what he was going through in private. Later, he decided to reveal his status to fellow dancer Mapule Sesedinyane who encouraged him to get treatment. The second person he told was his partner at the time, Tom, who became a great support system. Mhlongo told City Press that he did not write the book to get pity from the public or for fame. “I am 150% sure that [many people] are going through the same [experience] somewhere, but I can be the voice that brings in some light into somebody’s life.” He says in the process of adjusting and understanding the implications of the disease, there were good and bad days. “The were days I did not want the sun to rise. I was only looking forward to the evening because at night we are all the same. It’s the end of the day for everyone. But during the day, people that are doing well are visible,” he reckons. As if his life was not complicated enough, Mhlongo reveals in the book that his world crumbled further when he was accused of sexually assaulting a man. He maintains his innocence, arguing to this day that he wouldn’t do such a thing. “I struggled so much [to handle the matter] that I became depressed and I decided to take antidepressants. However, I took them for one day and I didn’t like the after-effects. “They made me feel like everything was okay when the reality was contrary. I had to face my problems head on. I stopped drinking and having casual sex. It was tough. I needed some spiritual guidance and upliftment. The only way was prayer,” he writes. He found peace when he started going to Rhema Bible Church, where he met kwaito group TKZee member Kabelo Mabalane, who was a recovering drug addict. He says the alleged sexual assault accusations almost ruined his career. Entertainment jobs dried up and life got increasingly tough. “I had a BMW Z4, which was also in arrears and the bank had called so many times I couldn’t take it anymore. The next thing, a knock on my door, they’d come to repossess the car. I took everything out of the car, and they took it and left,” he writes. “I was driving the big [Land Rover] Discovery and I couldn’t afford it. I was late with payments, my bond was in arrears, the banks were calling left, right and centre. “I didn’t have a cent to my name. I could have easily gone back to my mother’s house, but I was like, ‘no Somizi, soldier on, soldier on’, so I soldiered on,” he recalls. The book also shares details of his experiences and friendship with the late Brenda Fassie, who he says offered him drugs. “Everyone knew that Brenda smoked dagga and was into drugs. At some point, she offered me drugs. “I don’t know where I got it from, but I’ve always had a backbone,” he states. He is adamant that he has never touched drugs in his life, even though he has always been surrounded by users. He also spoke about how Mandoza and Bricks did cocaine in his presence. “I remember them fixing a portion for me to smoke. I took it and I threw it on the floor of the car without them seeing me. Then suddenly there were cops behind us.” Asked how he feels about the book, Mhlongo said he was afraid to read it because he felt it would take him back to the troubled episodes of his past life.

INSECURE'S JAY ELLIS LOVES MZANSI!,"Breakout star of the hit HBO series, Insecure, Jay Ellis says he is completely enthralled with South Africa.",,2017/11/28,DailySun,"Breakout star of the hit HBO series, Insecure, Jay Ellis says he is completely enthralled with South Africa. The actor and HIV/AIDS activist was in recently in the country and told the Daily Sun about how incredible he finds our country. Jay has been in SA for three months shooting a SONY movie called The Maze, a psychological thriller set to be released sometime in 2018. During his stay here, Jay has called Cape Town home. But this isn’t the first time, the sexy actor has been in Mzansi. Two years ago, Jay spent about two weeks in Johannesburg and he says that when he found out that The Maze would be shot in Cape Town, he was completely on board. “One of the reasons I took this job was because I got to come back to SA. I was here two years ago, but just in Johannesburg for about 10 days and fell in love. When I got the opportunity to do this movie and found out it was shooting here, I wanted to see more of the country,” he told the Daily Sun. Although the plot in the movie is set in the USA, it is entirely shot in Cape Town. “We filmed at UCT, we filmed at the Convention Centre, we filmed at Cape Town studios and a couple of other places. We’ve explored quite a bit,” said Jay. During his stay here, Jay has been exploring Cape Town, going up Table Mountain more times than he can count, visiting the beach, experiencing the art and culture and of course, sampling the wine. “There is an overwhelming feeling of peace and happiness that I get being here, especially being down by the water, being by the mountains. I’ve been up table mountain probably as much as people who work there and that view is breath-taking, every single time it hits me in a different way. It is this wonder that strikes me every single time. The other thing is that there is this sense of love here, and open arms, and happiness that I have experienced here and that has been transformative for sure,” he said. Jay says that the one thing which has completely taken him aback is the explosive art scene that people in his part of the world never get to hear about. Our music, performing arts, spoken word and traditional mediums of art (television, film and writing) have completely re-shaped Jay’s perspective on the world. “It’s been amazing. I will take it home with me, it will inform my world as I go home, but it is stuff that I wish that America and the world will one day be able to witness,” said Jay. If you’ve never heard of Jay, that’s because he keeps a very low profile, taking pleasure in having as much time to himself as possible. “The few moments of anonymity that I get to have are so precious. So when I can be away from the spotlight, I appreciate it. It lets get to spend time with my parents and my loved ones, friends and family, it’s important,” he said. But, no amount of keeping a low profile can help him escape the mega success of Insecure and subsequently, the fame that now follows all of its actors. On the show, Jay plays Lawrence, an app developer who, in the beginning plays boyfriend to Issa Rae, creator of the show who plays a character by the same name. Issa and Lawrence break up early on in the show and things take a very interesting turn. The show has been hailed as a successful portrayal of the lived experiences of black people; that they are also real, they experience the same emotions as everyone else, they have the same heartaches, successes and failures, the same insecurities. “What Insecure has done is that it has normalized a black experience, and it has put a group of people, a slice of life, in front of millions of people around the world, of multiple skin colours. You get to see these characters in their best, in their worst, in their happiness, their sadness, success and failures, insecurities and you get to relate to them,” says Jay.",Entertainment,"['filmed', 'completely', 'loves', 'ellis', 'plays', 'mzansi', 'insecure', 'insecures', 'movie', 'cape', 'happiness', 'world', 'jay', 'town']","Breakout star of the hit HBO series, Insecure, Jay Ellis says he is completely enthralled with South Africa.

TB: ACT NOW TO STAY HEALTHY,,,2018/05/31,DailySun,"DO you know what the top 10 causes of death are in Mzansi? You may be surprised to learn that tuberculosis (TB) comes in at number one, followed by diabetes at number two, with HIV coming in at number five. This is not just a serious problem for South Africa: 25% of the world’s population are infected by TB bacteria. Many people do not get the care they need, which is why the disease continues to spread. South Africa has adopted the international “90-90-90” targets for combating HIV and TB. This means that if 90% (nine out of 10) of people with HIV and TB know their status, get treated and stay on treatment, this will help prevent the spread of the diseases and keep people healthy. “TB is a highly infectious disease but it is also preventable and can be cured,” says Roger Tevan, the eThekwini District Co-ordinator for Health Systems Trust’s SA SURE Plus Project. “The main thing is to know the signs of TB and to get help early. Men in particular are not always proactive in looking after their own health. We must not be in denial. We need to make sure that we are keeping our families, colleagues and community healthy.” Tevan stresses that it is very important for workers to be tested for TB because some of the occupational risks they face can affect their immune response – such as exposure to chemical fumes. Some factories are not ventilated properly or don’t get direct sunlight. This can lead to the TB bacteria spreading among colleagues. “It can be difficult for people working in factories to get to the clinic,” says Tevan. “By the time they get home, the clinics are closed.” “TB spreads easily,” warns Tevan, “so an infected person getting into a crowded taxi with closed windows is the ideal place for the bacteria to spread. This means that infected people could also get an opportunistic infection because their immunity is low.” Some people may spread the bacteria that causes TB even if they don’t display symptoms themselves. Tevan also offers some simple tips to prevent the spread of TB: - Cover your mouth with a tissue if you cough or sneeze. - Wash your hands after sneezing or coughing. - Keep rooms well ventilated – fresh air helps to disperse TB bacteria. Some symptoms show that you should be tested for TB, such as coughing for longer than one month, feeling feverish, having night sweats, struggling to breathe, losing appetite, and feeling very weak. “If you have any of these symptoms, you should go to your nearest clinic. Once you have been tested and have started treatment, it is very important that you take your medicine properly because otherwise these drugs can stop working,” says Tevan.

A plague on our children!,"With over 400?000 new HIV infections a year, Mzansi still ranks first in HIV incidence in the world . . .",,2016/02/08,DailySun,"Some shocking stats show that over 2 300 girls between the ages of 15 and 24 are infected with HIV every single week! Stats for boys in this category are equally chilling, but research shows that the incidence of new HIV infections among young women is more than four times higher than that of their male counterparts. With over 400 000 new HIV infections a year, Mzansi still ranks first in HIV incidence in the world . . . Marina Rifkin, a public health specialist at CareWorks, an HIV management organisation, said the risk is particularly great for high school pupils because they are more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviour, such as unprotected sex. “Sexually active young women are particularly vulnerable as they often have sexual relationships with older men,” she said. Research conducted by the Centre for Aids Programme Research in SA shows a trend of girls getting HIV from older men. The study found that both girls and boys on completion of grade 7 remained HIV-negative. But by the time they finished Grade 12 about 7% to 10% of girls were HIV positive, yet most boys remained HIV negative. This is because the girls were having sex with older men who were likely to already have the HIV virus. “This age–gender difference in HIV infection rates is not stopping and therefore preventing HIV infection in this age group is a prerequisite for achieving an Aids-free generation and attaining epidemic control,” she said. Marina said that the first time of the country’s youth have sex is often much younger than 16 – the legal age of consensual sex – many have their first sexual experience at 14 years or even younger. Voluntary HIV counselling and testing, promotes a delay in the age of first sexual encounter as well as consistent, correct condom use, and has shown some success among the youth, but she said other prevention methods such as voluntary medical male circumcision is important and shouldn’t be ignored. Now, in Mzansi, over two million men, aged 15 to 49, have been circumcised – about halfway to the national target of circumcising 4,3 million males, aged 15 to 49, by the end of this year. “The once-off 20 minute procedure reduces a man’s risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections by up to 60%. Stats suggest that male circumcisions would reduce HIV incidence in eastern and southern Africa by roughly 30% to 50% over 10 years. “The message is that circumcision’s infection risk-reduction is substantial in the long term for men and women,” she said.",Health,"['children', 'girls', 'male', 'plague', 'infections', 'men', 'older', 'infection', 'sexual', 'hiv', 'sex', 'women']","With over 400 000 new HIV infections a year, Mzansi still ranks first in HIV incidence in the world . “Sexually active young women are particularly vulnerable as they often have sexual relationships with older men,” she said.

Everyone can now get ARVs!,THE KZN Health Department is ready to implement its new test and treat policy for all HIV-positive patients in the province.,,2016/09/07,DailySun,"THE KZN Health Department is ready to implement its new test and treat policy for all HIV-positive patients in the province. The World Health Organisation has said that early anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment will greatly benefit people infected by the virus. This means all HIV-infected people will get ARVs regardless of their CD4 count. Of 3,4 million people who are HIV-positive in South Africa, 1,1 million live in KZN. KZN health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo spoke at KwaDabeka Community Health Centre, west of Durban, on Thursday. “The national department of health emphasised that the implementation of the new policy will contribute to the National Development Plan’s goal of increasing citizens’ life expectancy to at least 70 years by 2030.” He said people diagnosed with HIV can live long and healthy lives once they are on ARV medication. “The health department in KZN is in a good position because it has trained many nurses to administer ARVs. “The size of the task at hand is such that we cannot only rely on doctors to provide the treatment and monitoring of patients.” He said the department is aware that the new policy is going to result in more HIV-positive people getting treatment, and this might lead to overcrowding and increased waiting times at health facilities. “To decrease the burden on patients and health facilities, the department has initiated a process of transferring stable patients to support groups. “They’ll make use of a system that will facilitate the distribution and dispensing of chronic medicine. “Patients will be able to choose where their medication should be sent, for example to clinics which are close to their homes.” Dhlomo called upon all patients who tested HIV-positive in the past but did not receive treatment to come forward so they can start receiving ARVs.

STUDENTS: SEX PAYS OUR FEES!,THEY GO to university to get an education but some still have some tough lessons to learn.,,,,"THEY GO to university to get an education but some still have some tough lessons to learn. Many young students fall into the hands of blessers. And the sell their bodies to pay their fees. This came out during a discussion group at the University of Joburg yesterday where the decriminalisation of sex work was discussed. Representatives from various government departments, NGOs and the private sector came together to exchange views and reach a decision. The discussion comes after Joburg Metro police and Emergency Services said they are not sure how to deal with magoshas when they raid buildings. This led to a discussion about students who turn to blessers and prostitution to afford food, pay their rent and afford tuition fees. Nthabiseng Ndimande, a representative from UJ’s Institutional Office for HIV/Aids, said not all students are able to afford fees or have been given bursaries. “Some students resort to prostitution or get blessers for financial gain. It is not by choice. They are trying to make ends meet and pay the rent,” she said. “This often leads to students being abused by blessers because of the financial power they have over them.” She said she met a student some time ago who was getting money from her blesser. During the course of the relationship the man made her become a magosha in order to repay him. “We ask the government to really look into this matter and when taking a decision, decide how the law will help students.” Nthabiseng said the organisation is doing its best to ensure the safety of the students. “We can’t tell them to stop if we can’t provide an alternative. They need the money and they will do it anyway. “The best we can do is to empower them with knowledge about the prevention of HIV/Aids and unwanted pregnancies.” The Institutional Office for HIV/Aids was established in 2006 and focuses mainly on student HIV and Aids programmes at the university.",,"['student', 'university', 'prostitution', 'fees', 'students', 'pays', 'pay', 'rent', 'blessers', 'afford', 'sex', 'hivaids', 'discussion']","Many young students fall into the hands of blessers.

The Metro FM radio host and TV personality survived a near carjacking accident on Sunday while passing through Khayelitsha. “It was horrific. A brick was thrown and it was directed at our window but it hit the car. The car is dented now and we are still a bit shaken, especially because we had children in the car. It really could have hurt someone, but I am glad that no one was injured,” said Criselda. The HIV/Aids activist advised people not to stop if an object has been placed on the road. “By now we all know that there are a lot of tactics that people use to hijack people,” she said. “The best advice that I’d give is that you should never stop when your car has been hit or if there is an obstruction on the road. “If a stone is thrown at you, just drive on and don’t stop until you know you are in a safe place.” She said that she is still enjoying her holiday and that nothing is going to mess up her time away.

CELEBRATE DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENCE!,"International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is marked annually on 17 May.",,,,"International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is marked annually on 17 May. It’s a day to draw the attention of policymakers, opinion leaders, social movements, the public and media to the violence and discrimination suffered by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people – all those who do not conform to the usual sexual and gender stereotypes. The date was specifically chosen to commemorate the World Health Organisation’s decision on 17 May 1990 to stop listing homosexuality as a mental disorder. A recent survey commissioned by the Other Foundation and undertaken by the Human Sciences Research Council about attitudes towards homosexuality and gender non-conformity in South Africa found that 70% of South Africans feel that homosexual sex and ignoring gender dressing norms is “wrong” and “disgusting”. In addition, almost 30% believe that gays and lesbians do not deserve the same human rights as the rest of the country’s citizens. What’s more, 450 000 have physically harmed women who dressed and behaved like men and 240 000 have beaten up men who dressed and behaved like women. Alarmingly, about three million South Africans said that they might commit acts of violence against people who do not conform to their gender ideas in the future. “These frightening figures highlight the importance of international day against homophobia and transphobia,” said Nina Morris Lee, head of marketing at the Anova Health Institute. It is currently spearheading wethebrave.co.za, a sexual health campaign targeted specifically at men who have sex with men. The organisers of the day against homophobia have pinpointed HIV, and stigma based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as needing critical action. This is due to the gay and lesbian community members around the world being disproportionately affected by HIV/Aids. Infection rates in men who have sex with men and transgendered individuals is up to 20 times higher than in the general population. This has contributed to them being left out of HIV/Aids prevention, care, treatment and support programmes. Up until the implementation of wethebrave.co.za, South Africa too largely ignored HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Funded by the Elton John Aids Foundation, the campaign addresses both prevention and treatment issues in a non-ju “Even with medical advancements, homophobia and transphobia, if not addressed, will always be a driver of HIV incidence among men who have sex with men.” For more information, visit www.wethebrave.co.za or dayagainsthomophobia.org/hiv-sogi-stigma.",,"['diversity', 'difference', 'treatment', 'prevention', 'day', 'gender', 'men', 'transphobia', 'sexual', 'homophobia', 'sex', 'south', 'celebrate']","International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia is marked annually on 17 May.

KAGISO TO BE CIRCUMCISED WITH 2000 MEN!,Brothers for Life ambassador Kagiso Modupe (33) has decided to get medically circumcised and is calling on 2000 men across the country to join him.,,2017/02/21,DailySun,"Brothers for Life ambassador Kagiso Modupe (33) has decided to get medically circumcised and is calling on 2000 men across the country to join him. Modupe is well loved for starring as Mangi Nyathi on the popular TV programme Scandal. “I would like South African men to join me in a celebration of masculinity, brotherhood and good health. I’m calling on men to be circumcised with me on Saturday, 11 March 2017. There are 200 clinics involved in #ZwakalaSkeem day and it’s absolutely free,” the actor said. Kagiso is encouraging men to book for a medical circumcision by sending a ‘please call me’ to 082 808 6152 to secure a slot on #ZwakalaSkeem day at one of 150 clinics in Gauteng, KZN, Mpumpalanga and the North West. “I was motivated to have this done when I read how it can protect my wife from getting Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which causes cervical cancer. But I’ve learnt that in a recent survey of 100 000 men, 47% do it for hygiene reasons and 38% for HIV prevention. Circumcision reduces the risk of contracting HIV by 60% as well as other sexually transmitted infections. Some men do it because it keeps the penis clean, and others because their partners prefer it, but whatever the reason, it’s the right thing to do,” said Modupe Kagiso will undergo the procedure at the Katlehong North Clinic. He has invited the Mini car club, a local DJ and the Ridge Riders Motorcycle Club to be there to celebrate the men who make the choice to circumcise. His wife, Liza Modupe will also take part in the celebrations. “I want it to be a chilled fun day where you can bring your wife and your kids,” he explains. When asked why he wasn’t already circumcised, Kagiso responded that he’d considered it after high school. “A doctor told me my foreskin was too small which turned out to be nonsense. Then there were the usual issues: I was nervous about the pain, the healing period and abstaining from sex. I’ve since discussed circumcision with men who have had the procedure. They say there is more discomfort than pain. Also, painkillers are provided. You can’t have sex or masturbate for six weeks afterwards, but I’ve timed it to be totally healed by my birthday.” Kagiso’s wife, Liza comments, “What he is doing is very brave. I totally support him and appreciate his decision to protect me and do the right thing.” Dr Khumbulani Moyo, Medical Male Circumcision Manager at the USAID-funded Voluntary Male Medical Circumcision consortium says: “The public health benefits are significant. One HIV infection can be prevented for every five circumcisions performed; it also reduces the risks of cervical, anal and prostate cancer. Circumcision is one of the most common procedures performed worldwide and when performed by healthcare professionals, complications are very rare.” After the circumcision, two follow up clinic visits are needed. Patients are advised to continue using condoms when having sex, to stick to one sexual partner and to know their HIV status. Any male aged 10 - 49 and in good health, irrespective of HIV status, is eligible for free circumcision in South Africa. Those under 18 need parental consent.

WHY MEN SHOULD CONSIDER GETTING CIRCUMCISED,Being a healthy individual takes effort. For the majority of us it will sadly not just happen naturally.,,2017/10/15,DailySun,"Being a healthy individual takes effort. For the majority of us it will sadly not just happen naturally. For example, you need to be proactive about eating the right foods and need to make time to exercise. For men, another proactive step towards optimal health is through medical circumcision. Many benefits Health24 defines medical male circumcision as the surgical removal of the foreskin. Circumcision is performed for cultural, religious or medical reasons. An example of a culture which practises circumcision is the Xhosa people, where young men are circumcised as part of their initiation process into manhood. Jews and Muslims include routine neonatal (new-born) circumcision as part of their religion. However, many men who do not fall into these categories also opt for circumcision. This is known as medical male circumcision as it is done purely for medical reasons. There are many benefits to getting circumcised, not only for you but your sexual partner as well. Some reasons you should consider getting circumcised: - Decreases the risk of HIV - Decreases the risk of STIs - Lowers risk of prostate cancer - Maintaining hygiene is easier - No chance of tearing and bruising during sex, which may lead to infection - Reduces womens risk of cervical cancer Brothers for Life explain that in the skin of the foreskin are unique cells, called Langerhans cells, which attract the cells that produce HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STIs). This is why there is a higher risk of HIV and STIs when the foreskin is present. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), because the inner mucosal area of the foreskin is not keratinised and hosts a wealth of Langerhans cells, it is very susceptible to HIV. During heterosexual intercourse the foreskin is pulled back along the shaft of the penis, and the entire inner surface of the foreskin is exposed to vaginal secretions, providing a large area where HIV transmission can take place. The Procedure It advisable to get an HIV test before the actual procedure. The surgical procedure is done by a doctor or trained nurse and takes about 30 minutes. A localised anaesthetic is used to numb the area and pain medication is given to manage any discomfort once the anaesthetic wears off after the procedure. Recovery time is generally six weeks, during which time you cannot have sex or masturbate. Proper wound management once the procedure is done is very important. The dressing is initially applied by the medical practitioner; they will also show you how to keep the wound clean and change the dressing.

INCREDIBLE CLAIMS OF HEALING USING OXYGEN,HERE is an example of a diabetic patient who suffered a spider bite that quickly went bad and soon gangrene set in.,,2018/12/15,DailySun,"HERE is an example of a diabetic patient who suffered a spider bite that quickly went bad and soon gangrene set in. According to the story, the patient’s doctor suggested amputation as the gangrene would not heal, but someone suggested the diabetic man use Mega Oxygen in high doses. Within five days of using the product, the patient recovered drastically, as the photographs show. The first photograph is claimed to have been taken on 22 June of this year while the second allegedly was taken on 28 July – not even a month apart.

BIG BOOST FOR CIRCUMCISIONS!,The US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief has provided more than R30 million to speed up medical male circumcision in Mzansi over the next five years.,,2016/12/08,DailySun,"The US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief has provided more than R30 million to speed up medical male circumcision in Mzansi over the next five years. This is good news as the World marked Aids Day on 1 December. Medical male circumcision has been widely promoted as a way to curb the HIV infection rate as it has been shown to reduce a man’s lifetime risk of HIV acquisition through heterosexual sex by up to 60%, which in a country like ours – that has nearly 7 million people living with HIV – cannot be ignored. Rachael Rawlinson, chief operations officer at CareWorks, said the money will go to high-risk areas such as KZN, Mpumalanga in Gauteng. She said CareWorks, the Department of Health and other partners have made a big difference in the lives of the more than 2,3 million men who have chosen to get the cut at clinics. “Soon South Africa will reach a point where people on antiretroviral treatment will outstrip new HIV infections – a turning point in the HIV epidemic.

The average life expectancy for women was 63 years in 2013, with men living on average 57.7 years. By contrast, in 1990 women lived on average 68.9 years and men had a life expectancy of 60.5 years, according to research co-ordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US. Out of the 188 countries included in the study South Africa ranked 162nd for women and 169th for men for the longest life expectancies. The leading killers in South Africa were HIV/Aids, stroke, and pneumonia, accounting for 51 percent of all deaths in 2013. This compared to 15 percent in 1990. In 1990 pneumonia was the first cause of death in South Africa (26,614 deaths) and stroke the 5th leading cause of death (21,360 deaths), while HIV accounted for about 415 deaths. Altogether, the three conditions accounted for less than 15 percent of all deaths recorded in the country in 1990. In 2013 HIV/Aids and interpersonal violence were the top two causes of death for people between the ages of 15 and 49, resulting in 191,792 lives lost. In 1990 HIV/Aids and violence accounted for about 2460 deaths in the age group 15 to 49 years (with HIV/Aids claiming only about 200 lives in this age group in that year).

Circumcised for health,MEN in Mzansi are becoming more interested in circumcision for health reasons.,,2016/04/25,DailySun,"MEN in Mzansi are becoming more interested in circumcision for health reasons. Rachael Rawlinson, the prevention programme manager at CareWorks, the HIV management organisation, told SunHealth that the interest in male circumcision was due to studies done in Mzansi, Kenya and Uganda which found that male circumcision could reduce the risk of HIV infection by up to 60%. It has also been found that circumcision can protect a circumcised man’s female partner from certain other sexually transmitted infections. During 2014, in the 14 priority African countries, over three million men were circumcised. This is a 22% increase from 2013, and an amazing 750% increase from the number of circumcisions performed in 2010! Rachael said circumcision was popular right now, especially among men between the ages of 15 and 24 years who were choosing the 20-minute surgical procedure. “From a medical and hygiene point of view, men who haven’t been circumcised are more prone to a wide range of infectious diseases, such as HIV, thrush, syphilis, human papilloma virus or HPV, and urinary tract infections. “Prostate cancer rates also tend to be higher in uncircumcised men. “The rates of HPV infection and cervical cancer are also higher in their partners. “The lack of circumcision increases a man’s risk of contracting HIV by up to eight times – and the risk is even higher when other infections are present,” she said. The method of circumcision you choose is something you would need to discuss with your doctor if you’re considering a voluntary medical male circumcision, said Rachael.

Launching in conjunction with his photographic exhibition “Women in Gold”, South Africa will get a glimpse of the man behind the star persona – a man with a golden heart and the soul of a gentleman. During his 4-day stay Banderas will have a busy agenda - demonstrating his passion as the face of his perfume brand, his talent as a photographer, and his generous side through his collaboration with Nkosi’s Haven. The visit will begin with a media briefing, followed by a viewing of Antonio Banderas’ photographic exhibition “Women in Gold”. “Women in Gold” is a series of 22 photographs, 5 of which are limited edition, that “reveal the magic that surrounds every woman and makes her unique and irresistible”. It’s a tribute to all women worldwide, and a reflection of the fascination and profound respect that the actor has for the feminine universe. Since 2013, the collection has traveled to numerous countries such as Spain, Chile, Colombia, Peru,Brazil and Russia. In every country, Banderas has collaborated with a local NGO that supports causes close to his heart. In South Africa, he is working with Nkosi’s Haven to raise money to help Mothers and Children infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. From the very beginning of his collaboration with Puig, who partners with him on his fragrances, Banderas has been very clear that he wants to use his perfumes as a platform to support social causes. As he put it himself: “One good thing about being famous is that it gives me a great potential to support good causes. As a celebrity, I feel that it’s my duty to give society something back in return for all that it has given me.” Nkosi’s Haven started in 1999 and offers holistic care and support for destitute HIV/AIDS infected mothers, their children, and resulting AIDS orphans (infected or not). It is named after Nkosi Johnson, the remarkable young AIDS activist who passed away on June 1st2001. After being separated from his own mom because of the HIV diagnosis, he never wanted that to happen to any other child. Not only will Nkosi’s Haven benefit from funds raised through the auction of the “Women in Gold” photos, as well as through the sale of limited tickets to the public for the gala dinner, but African Sales Company, distributors of Banderas’ fragrances in South Africa, has also committed to donating R100 000.

Learn how to say NO to blessers!,THE war against blessers has picked up.,,2016/10/21,DailySun,"THE war against blessers has picked up. An international health initiative has thrown its weight in behind the fight against men who have sex with girls in exchange for gifts. The initiative falls under the American president’s emergency plan for Aids relief. More than 2 500 girls and young women packed the community hall at KwaCaluza in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands for an eye-opening debate that took place over the weekend. One of the initiative’s ambassadors, Minenhle Dladla, said girls should be alert because blessers openly prey on them on the street, in clubs and in taverns. “They want to bless girls with hair braids, shoes, clothes, cash and outings to fancy restaurants. Many girls say yes because they want to enjoy themselves and need the money.” She urged the girls to use other methods to solve their problems. “There are teachers and social workers who are like parents to us. They are always there to help us as children – there is no need to go to blessers,” said Minenhle. Andiswa Moloi said: “We need to take this information to heart and be more aware so that we can spot risks from a distance. “Many girls depend on blessers to provide them with food, clothes, phones and so on. “We can use the female condom to protect ourselves during sex, but the truth is that blessers will ruin our lives. “They don’t want to use condoms, so they pass HIV on to girls.” KZN has more people infected with HIV than any other province in South Africa, and 12% of people between 15 and 24 are HIV-positive.

75% in Western Cape without medical aid,THE Western Cape health department has said 75% of people in the province are currently without medical aid cover.,,2016/08/20,DailySun,"THE Western Cape health department has said 75% of people in the province are currently without medical aid cover. The department was presenting to Parliaments portfolio committee on health on Thursday, providing a status update in its efforts to implement the ""Ideal Clinic Initiative"". Department head Dr Beth Engelbrecht told the committee the province is moving away from only treating illnesses and would now be focusing on wellness to help those uninsured. ""The department really has to reflect on how to do business differently because we sit with these realities of a reduced budget but an increase in patient growth. ""Our strategic goal for 2030 is on wellness and not specifically the treatment of disease."" HIV/Aids, chronic illnesses The Western Cape health department has a R20bn budget to treat its 6.3 million people. The province has the highest life expectancy rate per capita in the country, at 66 years. When it comes to HIV and Aids, people aged 24-35 are still the worst affected. There was also a worrying increase in contraction of the virus among adolescent girls, the only provincial increase in the country in that age bracket. HIV/Aids was, however, no longer the main cause of death in children under 5, now accounting for 7% of child deaths, falling 13% since 2000. It was however still the leading cause of maternal deaths, with 36% linked to the virus. Almost half of maternal deaths are avoidable, the department said. At least 58% of South Africas deaths were linked to chronic illnesses and 32.7% of women were obese in the province, which was 8% higher than the national average, while a shocking 80% of people with mental disorders do not receive treatment. From the cradle to the grave Like the Eastern Cape, the province also had budget constraints. Engelbrecht said the departments real term budget was actually decreasing due to a renewed wage agreement with its 31 300 staff members. Provincial health MEC NomaFrench Mbombo told the committee that the only way for the province to get ahead of its issues was to focus on prevention and the ""road to wellness"". ""When it comes to health, we have to focus on the poorest of the poor. Unlike other departments, in health, we have to look after citizens from the cradle to the grave, from the oldest to the youngest.""

WHAT MINORS CAN CONSENT TO,Children under the age of 18 are considered minors by law. This means they have limited rights to consent to certain things without the help of an adult,,,,"KAMOGELO (13) was adopted by a single mum four years ago. After the adoption, his mum got married and her husband was uncomfortable with the idea of not knowing what illnesses or diseases Kamogelo might have. He then tried to force Kamogelo to take an HIV test he didn’t want. Azikhiphi! His mum turned to Scorpion Legal Protection, which provides paralegal assistance on child-related matters. What does the law say? Children under the age of 18 are considered minors by law. This means they have limited rights to consent to certain things without the help of an adult. But in Mzansi, legislators have realised children have ever-changing capacity when making independent decisions. These laws allow children to make certain decisions without the help or guidance of an adult. The child’s decision should be respected by adults. What can minors consent to? Under the law, children under the age of 18 can consent to the following without the assistance of an adult: Section 129 (3) of the Children’s Act allows them to consent to a surgical procedure if the child is: 1. Older than 12. 2. Mature enough to understand the risks, benefits, and social implications of the procedure. 3. Assisted by their parent or guardian. Children older than 12 can consent to an HIV test. Children aged 12 and older can consent to contraceptives and advice thereon. ) Girls can consent to terminate a pregnancy at any age. Children older than 16 can consent to sex. Sex under the age of 16 is illegal. Children younger than 18 cannot consent to marriage. Four facts on marriage and children’s consent Children cannot be forced into marriage. A child cannot get married before the age of puberty (12 for girls and 14 for boys). Girls aged from 12 to 14 and boys from 14 to 17 can consent to marriage, if their parents and the minister of Home Affairs give consent. Adults (18 and older) can consent independently. What can you do? Kamogelo is older than 12 and can decide not to take an HIV test. Legally, an adult cannot force him to take the test. His mum’s husband cannot force him and, if he continues, Kamogelo – with the help of his mum and a Scorpion lawyer – can stop him. Children have legal rights all adults should adhere to. How to strike back There are laws that protect children from adults making decisions for them not in their best interest. With Scorpion, Kamogelo can exercise his right to say no. Scorpion Legal Protection gives policyholders paralegal assistance on child-related cases. This is general advice, the law is complicated and this advice should not be relied upon solely.

STICKING WITH THE ROAD TO HEALTH,"BY now, most adults know that diseases like HIV, high blood pressure and diabetes are chronic conditions that can be managed by taking medication and living a healthy lifestyle.",,2018/04/19,DailySun,"BY now, most adults know that diseases like HIV, high blood pressure and diabetes are chronic conditions that can be managed by taking medication and living a healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, it is not always as easy to stick with a treatment plan as we think it is. The clinic is sometimes far, and very crowded, and this means that patients have to take time off work, or away from their busy lives to get their chronic medication. Adherence clubs have emerged as a solution to these challenges we face. Because an adherence club has a trained health care worker running the club, they can also help with guidance on nutrition and side-effects, which are other barriers to not sticking with a dedicated treatment plan. Professional Nurse Philiswa Matiso is aptly named – her name means “healer” in isiXhosa. She works for Sakhimpilo Home Community-based Care Project, based in Tsolo in the rural Eastern Cape, which runs adherence clubs for people on chronic medication. “Many people live far from clinics so cannot always come and fetch their chronic medication. Some get confused about their medicine, while others are even in denial to themselves. Our job is to ensure that all patients get their chronic medicine, that they take it properly and that they have someone to speak to about any other health issues.” The clubs are open to people who have been stable for a year on chronic medication such as antiretroviral therapy or blood pressure treatment. Members of the club only need to go back to the clinic twice a year for a physical check-up and for their treatment to be assessed. The programme is a targeted approach to reduce waiting times at clinics and to make sure that nurses have time to give quality care to patients. “Instead of people sitting in queues for hours, spending money on transport and sometimes having to miss work to attend the clinic simply to get their medicine, the clubs are a space for people to pop in to collect their medication, to engage with a qualified health worker and to be quickly referred for any other illnesses arising,” says Malibongwe Daweti, Community Co-ordinator for Health Systems Trust. For the elderly, the clubs can literally be a lifesaver. “Sometimes we used to spend the whole day sitting in the clinic to get our medication,” says Mhlakulo Sondaba (65). “Now I collect it at the adherence club, or they deliver it to me if I am not well enough to attend. The club helps to motivate me to take my medicine every day at the right time, and now I have more time to work in my garden.” Her garden is not just her hobby but her livelihood too. “We don’t just have to take our treatment; we must take care of our own health. Many problems are coming from our food, things like fast food, frozen chicken and processed meat make us sick. I want everyone to grow vegetables so they know how veggies without chemicals taste.” Tobias Sibuta (63) credits the Sakhimpilo team with keeping him fit and healthy. “There is never a time we haven’t received our medicine, even when the bridge is under water,” he says. “It is such a long way to the clinic but now we don’t have to go every month. We only go to get checked and get a new prescription.” The club meets every two months, and once every six months the clients return to the clinic to check their blood pressure or for viral load tests and to get a new script. People with TB symptoms cannot attend adherence clubs because the disease is highly contagious, especially for those with weakened immune systems. However, many people with HIV also develop TB, so the clubs are the perfect place to identify TB patients and to ensure that they are tested and treated. The Sakhimpilo staff also trace family and contacts of the patients identified with TB and refer them to the clinic for testing and treatment if necessary. Adherence clubs are giving people the power to be responsible for their own health and wellbeing. “This community care approach to health means that each of us must take responsibility and ensure that we do everything we can to stay fit and healthy,” says Matiso. “I tell everyone in the club ‘you are not sick, you just have a manageable condition’.” You can take control of your health by sticking with it.

Lucilla Blankenberg, co-director of the trust, said most of the celebrities involved in the campaign support male circumcision as a way to offer additional protection against HIV, sexually transmitted infections, penile and prostate cancer and other life-threatening conditions. “Men are not immune to these diseases. About 7 million people are living with HIV in our country, and prostate cancer is the most common cancer among South African men. Medical male circumcision has been proven to offer men many protective benefits and there really shouldn’t be any hesitation to undergo the procedure.” The celebrity ambassadors include multi-talented musician and composer, Khaya Mthethwa. Mthethwa said what prompted him to take action by putting his name behind the campaign was his love for his fellow man. “Life is not just about taking care of ourselves. It’s about looking out for our families and others as well. HIV is a major health concern and I cannot idly stand by and do nothing. A pro-active approach by all is what is going to put an end to the disease.” Luthuli Dlamini, most well-known for his role as Stan Nyathi on Scandal, said: “It’s a great cause and it promotes health and safety for all. Circumcision reduces the risk of HIV and of women getting cervical cancer.” Blankenberg said: “Medical male circumcision reduces a man’s risk of contracting HIV by 60% which makes it an important prevention measure in the fight against the disease, which claimed the lives of over 150 000 South Africans last year.” To book a free circumcision, SMS your full name to 35255 and a counsellor will call you back.",Health,"['circumcision', 'male', 'man', 'men', 'medical', 'cancer', 'trust', 'hiv', 'health', 'support', 'safe', 'south', 'cut']","Lucilla Blankenberg, co-director of the trust, said most of the celebrities involved in the campaign support male circumcision as a way to offer additional protection against HIV, sexually transmitted infections, penile and prostate cancer and other life-threatening conditions.

Don’t have unsafe sex – MEC,MALE circumcision is not a licence for men to have unprotected sex.,,2016/10/06,DailySun,"MALE circumcision is not a licence for men to have unprotected sex. This was the warning from KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo during a male circumcision programme at Umbumbulu Clinic, south of Durban, on Tuesday. Dhlomo urged all men to remember that circumcision only lowers the chances of HIV infection by 60%. “It is not a licence to behave anyhow. Do not make the mistake of having unprotected sex just because you are circumcised,” he warned. Young men and schoolboys have taken advantage of the circumcision camps that are have been rolled out across the province during the school holidays. Dhlomo, a qualified medical doctor, personally circumcised four men on Tuesday. Dhlomo said: “This is not only about cutting the foreskin, it also entails exposing young men to mentorship, moulding and life orientation. While attending the camps, the boys are taught to become good and responsible men of tomorrow, who respect themselves, as well as women and children.” Dhlomo said no death has occurred in the province since the programme began. He urged young people to remain sexually responsible and make the right decisions at all times. “Even when you go to your matric dance, you must always make sure you come back clean and free of diseases,” he said.

Always strive for safer sex!,ADCOCK South Africa wants to make sure that young people across the country play it safe during sex.,,,,"ADCOCK South Africa wants to make sure that young people across the country play it safe during sex. The health and beauty products distributor donated Lifestyle condoms worth R400 000 to the Dis-Chem Foundation last week. Managing director Jason Frichol said this was a good opportunity to give back to the community by raising awareness on sexual activity. “The rate of new HIV infections is still high among our youth, but there is also an alarming rise of sexual transmitted diseases like gonorrhoea,” said Jason. “High quality condoms is the contraceptive answer,” said Jason. Penny Stein of the foundation said: “Health is our concern and this donation will definitely make a difference to our communities.” She said that there was a staggering number of babies abandoned every year. To kickstart the programme, 65 000 condoms will be distributed to beneficiaries like Afrika Tikkun, African Children’s Feeding Scheme, the Smile Foundation and Caring4girls. According to figures released by the Department of Health, more than a million people have been treated for sexually transmitted diseases in the past year and the number is rising. Another scary statistic shows less than half of adults aged between 18 to 44 years have been tested for any infections, not just HIV/Aids. This leads to a whole number of problems if not treated correctly, especially for women.

Paul’s play Blessers Must Fall, which was first shown at the Soweto Theatre last year, was staged at the Lutheran Church at Ster Park in Polokwane, Limpopo, on Sunday. He told SunBuzz he’s on a mission to educate the youth. “We can’t just look away when we see our children throwing themselves at men with money just to get what they want.” He said young girls want to use blessers as elevators to success instead of working hard to create better futures. “If I only condemn the blessers, the young girls will think what they’re doing is good when it’s not,” said the playwright. The congregation loved the play and the lessons it taught them. The play centres around Gregory, a church member and teacher. Gregory was a blesser which eventually led to him being infected with HIV. “The play outlines the social consequences of having a blesser. We look at teenage pregnancy, HIV/Aids, poverty, sexual abuse and other issues that affect the youth today.” In the play, Reverend Medupi goes to a local clinic to pray for the sick. He is shocked to see Gregory coming out of a nurse’s room with his HIV treatment. The reverend was angry with Gregory because he knew he had been sleeping around and he feared he had made all the women he was with sick. Medupi refused to pray for Gregory and called him a dog. “I can’t pray for this one. Even if you die I will never come to your funeral because I don’t bury dogs. You slept with almost every woman at your school and girls in our church. “The painful part is that you even impregnated Cynthia, the woman I wanted to marry,” said the angry reverend. Rapetsoa said people can learn from the play. “I hope it teaches our communities about morals.

Arrested for sex with more than 100 girls!,"MALAWI police have arrested an HIV-infected man who was paid to have sex with more than 100 adolescent girls as part of a traditional ritual marking their passage to womanhood, officials said today.",,2016/07/26,DailySun,"MALAWI police have arrested an HIV-infected man who was paid to have sex with more than 100 adolescent girls as part of a traditional ritual marking their passage to womanhood, officials said today. Eric Aniva, from the southern district of Nsanje, was held after giving a media interview confessing to have slept with the girls for a fee of between four and seven dollars, paid by each of their families. The little-known local practice lasts three days and is performed in southern Malawi by men known as “hyenas” at the request of a girl’s parents after her first menstruation. The ritual is believed to train girls to become good wives and to protect them from disease or misfortune that could fall on their families or their village. “Aniva was arrested on Monday after he was summoned to my office,” district commissioner Gift Lapozo said. In a BBC interview broadcast last week, Aniva confessed to being infected with HIV and sleeping with at least 100 girls without using protection. “Some girls are just 12 or 13 years old, but I prefer them older,” he said. “All these girls find pleasure in having me as their hyena. They actually are proud and tell other people that this man is a real man, he knows how to please a woman.” It was unclear over how many years Aniva had been a “hyena“. Malawian President Peter Mutharika had earlier issued a statement ordering Aniva’s arrest and calling for an inquiry into the role of the parents involved. Aniva should “be investigated for exposing the young girls to contracting HIV and further be charged accordingly,” Mutharika added. “Harmful cultural and traditional practices cannot be accepted.” The sexual cleansing ritual is also performed on bereaved widows in Nsanje district to exorcise villages of evil spirits or to prevent another death occurring. Aniva, who has two wives and was reported to be in his 40s, said a “hyena” was selected by the community based on good morals and that custom did not allow him to use condoms. “There was nothing else I could have done,” one girl told the BBC. “I had to do it for the sake of my parents. If I’d refused, my family members could be attacked with diseases — even death — so I was scared.” Malawi, which has one of the highest HIV infections in the world, criminalises sex with a person under the age of 16. If found guilty of underage sex, Aniva could be imprisoned for life. http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/malawi-orders-arrest-of-man-paid-to-have-sex-with-children-20160726-4",International,"['ritual', 'girls', 'arrested', 'aniva', 'man', 'district', 'malawi', 'hiv', 'wives', '100', 'parents', 'sex']","MALAWI police have arrested an HIV-infected man who was paid to have sex with more than 100 adolescent girls as part of a traditional ritual marking their passage to womanhood, officials said today.

Collett said many youth justify their non-usage of condoms by saying that porn stars do not use condoms, so they did not see why they would have to use them too.

The departments of health and education play a significant role through awareness campaigns and teaching about the pandemic at schools. Such efforts by government are cancelled by the stigma we attach to the disease. This makes it difficult for people to test for HIV and disclose their status if they test positive. The risk of contracting and spreading the disease is still high. It boggles the mind why it is so easy for people to disclose their status when they are diagnosed with other killer diseases, but not HIV/Aids. Heart disease, cancer, TB and other chronic diseases have been killing people for years before Aids emerged in the 1980s. These deadly diseases continue to claim the lives of our loved ones but Aids is stigmatised. We should not be ashamed to disclose our HIV status. Our children should grow up knowing how to avoid it. HIV/Aids is a national problem that affects us all. It has swept many parents into graves, leaving many child orphans to suffer in poverty and grow up without proper parental guidance.

Of the 26 clinics earmarked for refurbishment, 12 have been completed. The remaining 14 clinics are expected to be completed before the end of June. Gabriels said the clinics were selected by the provincial health department after an evaluation done in 2013. He said most of the planned changes were specifically focused on ways to provide care for patients, as well as improve clinic privacy in HIV counselling and treatment. The improvements were needed to provide a stigma-free, private space for counselling and testing. He said this allowed clinics to provide patients with dignity when they accessed the services. “While there are some public clinics available to communities, they are not used as efficiently as possible.

She may not be named to protect the childs identity. She pleaded not guilty to rape, conspiracy to commit rape, and attempted murder. The court heard that the boyfriend, who was HIV-positive, had died.

What makes things worse is that it happened not once but several times, and on different days,"" he said. Geldenhuys said there was no evidence about whether the boyfriend influenced her or not, as she had denied any involvement and did not testify.

BIRTH CONTROL DIDN'T HELP ME,Dear MizzB.,,,,"Dear MizzB I am 16 but feel as if my life is over. I went to the clinic a week ago to get contraceptives, as my boyfriend and I are sexually active. We always argue about using condoms. My problem is I got the contraceptive injection and still fell pregnant. How is this possible and what can I do? Dear Girl Having mixed feelings is understandable and you shouldn’t be too hard on yourself, as people will judge you. Contraceptives can take anything from five to 14 days to be effective. This is why it is still important to use condoms for prevention and protection against unplanned pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. Talk to your parents to get their support and guidance in making important decisions about your future. Accepting yourself over this won’t end your dreams.",,"['unplanned', 'wont', 'youcontraceptives', 'birth', 'week', 'using', 'help', 'understandable', 'sexually', 'control', 'transmitted', 'important', 'went', 'didnt']","Dear MizzBI am 16 but feel as if my life is over.
