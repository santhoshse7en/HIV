London HIV patient becomes world's second AIDS cure hope,"London, Mar 5: An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors said.Almost three years after receiving bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after coming off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the man's previous HIV infection.",,2019-03-06,The Daily Observer,"London, Mar 5: An HIV-positive man in Britain has become the second known adult worldwide to be cleared of the AIDS virus after he received a bone marrow transplant from an HIV resistant donor, his doctors said. Almost three years after receiving bone marrow stem cells from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV infection - and more than 18 months after coming off antiretroviral drugs - highly sensitive tests still show no trace of the mans previous HIV infection. ""There is no virus there that we can measure. We cant detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man. The case is a proof of the concept that scientists will one day be able to end AIDS, the doctors said, but does not mean a cure for HIV has been found. Gupta described his patient as ""functionally cured"" and ""in remission"", but cautioned: ""Its too early to say hes cured."" The man is being called ""the London patient"", in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown, who became known as the Berlin patient when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV. Brown, who had been living in Berlin, has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV experts, is still HIV-free. Some 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV and the AIDS pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s. Scientific research into the complex virus has in recent years led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay in most patients. Gupta, now at Cambridge University, treated the London patient when he was working at University College London. The man had contracted HIV in 2003, Gupta said, and in 2012 was also diagnosed with a type of blood cancer called Hodgkins Lymphoma. In 2016, when he was very sick with cancer, doctors decided to seek a transplant match for him. ""This was really his last chance of survival,"" Gupta told Reuters in an interview. The donor - who was unrelated - had a genetic mutation known as CCR5 delta 32, which confers resistance to HIV. The transplant went relatively smoothly, Gupta said, but there were some side effects, including the patient suffering a period of ""graft-versus-host"" disease - a condition in which donor immune cells attack the recipients immune cells. Most experts say it is inconceivable such treatments could be a way of curing all patients. The procedure is expensive, complex and risky. To do this in others, exact match donors would have to be found in the tiny proportion of people - most of them of northern European descent - who have the CCR5 mutation that makes them resistant to the virus. Specialists said it is also not yet clear whether the CCR5 resistance is the only key - or whether the graft versus host disease may have been just as important. Both the Berlin and London patients had this complication, which may have played a role in the loss of HIV-infected cells, Gupta said. Sharon Lewin, an expert at Australias Doherty Institute and co-chair of the International AIDS Societys cure research advisory board, told Reuters the London case points to new avenues for study. ""We havent cured HIV, but (this) gives us hope that its going to be feasible one day to eliminate the virus,"" she said. Gupta said his team plans to use these findings to explore potential new HIV treatment strategies. ""We need to understand if we could knock out this (CCR5) receptor in people with HIV, which may be possible with gene therapy,"" he said. The London patient, whose case was set to be reported in the journal Nature and presented at a medical conference in Seattle on Tuesday, has asked his medical team not to reveal his name, age, nationality or other details. -REUTERS",{},"['london', 'patient', 'hope', 'man', 'hiv', 'cure', 'gupta', 'case', 'donor', 'aids', 'known', 'second', 'worlds', 'doctors', 'virus']","We can't detect anything,"" said Ravindra Gupta, a professor and HIV biologist who co-led a team of doctors treating the man.

Third HIV patient ‘cured’ of virus after bone marrow transplant,"LONDON, Mar 9: A third, previously HIV-positive person now appears to be free of the virus following a bone marrow transplant. The patient shows no signs of HIV after three months without antiviral drugs, doctors have said.The case of the",,2019-03-10,The Daily Observer,"Third HIV patient ‘cured’ of virus after bone marrow transplant The case of the ""Dusseldorf patient"" was reported at a scientific conference this week, but doctors said their remission is still at an early stage. It came hours after researchers reported a ""London patient"" was the second ever person to see their HIV-positive status ""cured"" by a bone marrow transplant - which effectively replaces and reboots the cells of the immune system where HIV persists. The London patient, who has decided to remain anonymous, has been off virus-suppressing drugs for 18 months and has no detectable traces of HIV, researchers reported in the journal Nature earlier this week. This third case has only been off the medication for three months, but biopsies of tissue taken from lymph nodes and the gut show no sign of infection, doctors told the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle. Bone marrow transplants have been known as a possible ""cure"" for HIV since the 2007 case of American Timothy Ray Brown, known as the ""Berlin patient"". He was diagnosed with leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells which make up the immune system, and was given a transplant to replace his cancerous cells with a donors after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The crucial factor for the patients ""cured"" of HIV in this way is that their donor carried a mutation in a gene called CCR5 which is only found in around 1 per cent of people in Western Europe - and is even more rare elsewhere. People with a CCR5 mutation are naturally resistant to HIV and when used in a bone marrow transplant it effectively means the virus cannot return. The procedure is unlikely to be a viable solution for the millions with HIV. In part because of the scarcity of CCR5 donors, but chiefly because of the risks of the procedure, which can see the donated cells rejected and has only been attempted in patients with life-threatening blood cancers - such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the case of the London patient. Doctors say they are tracking a handful of other people who had HIV and have then had a CCR5 bone marrow transplant thanks to a register of CCR5 donors compiled by the IciStem collaboration. This includes two patients who are still taking anti-retroviral medicines, as stopping taking the drugs risks harming their immune system and becoming infectious again. Now multiple cases have shown that the CCR5 mutation can be protective against HIV researchers have said inserting the gene with technologies like Crispr could be a more viable way of treating it in future. -INDEPENDENT LONDON, Mar 9: A third, previously HIV-positive person now appears to be free of the virus following a bone marrow transplant.

HIV used to cure 'bubble boy' disease,"US scientists say they used HIV to make a gene therapy that cured eight infants of severe combined immunodeficiency, or",,2019-04-21,The Daily Observer,"HIV used to cure bubble boy disease Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems. Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants. The gene therapy involved collecting the babies bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth. The ""correct"" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month. Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, said in a statement: ""These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives."" ""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1,"" she added, referring to the most common type of SCID. The patients were treated at St Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Childrens Hospital in San Francisco. What is this syndrome? The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber. Nicknamed ""Bubble Boy"", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant. Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency. His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born. What are other treatment options? Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor. But according to St Jude, more than 80% of these patients lack such donors and must rely on blood stem cells from other donors. This process is less likely to cure the bubble boy disease, and is more likely to cause serious side effects as a result of treatment. Previous advancements in gene therapy provided alternatives to a bone marrow transplant, but these treatments sometimes involved chemotherapy and had implications for a range of other diseases, including blood disorders, sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and metabolic syndrome. -BBC US scientists say they used HIV to make a gene therapy that cured eight infants of severe combined immunodeficiency, or ""bubble boy"" disease.Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems.Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants.The gene therapy involved collecting the babies bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth.The ""correct"" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month.Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, said in a statement: ""These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives.""""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1,"" she added, referring to the most common type of SCID.The patients were treated at St Jude Childrens Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Childrens Hospital in San Francisco.What is this syndrome?The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber.Nicknamed ""Bubble Boy"", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant.Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency.His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born.What are other treatment options?Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor.

When asked about the status of the Rohingya children, he said ""Most of the children we received here are either not vaccinated or poorly vaccinated. So we want a fresh start, he said. He also confirmed the presence of rubella disease among Rohingya children. Suman Baruya , Upazila Health and Family Welfare official of Coxs Bazar Sadar 250 Bed District Sadar Hospital noted that about 60 patients were admitted to the Teknaf 50-Bed Hospital. Of them, three are suffering from tuberculosis and jaundice. Pronab Kumar Chowdhury, Chief of Child Health Department, Chittagong Medical College Hospital said that Myanmar did not provide Rohingyas any treatment facilities. He also added that the two diseases measles and tuberculosis can spread out in the air through coughing, posing serious health threat to other children and refugees. He noted that about 112 patients have received treatment from CMCH till August 26. Of them, about 90 people were hit by bullet and rest are burnt patients. Till now two Rohingya refugees have died during receiving treatment, of them one was hit by bullet. Besides such contagious diseases Rohingya refuges are also affected with HIV/AIDs diseases, health expert said. Hafiz Ahmed, Divisional Coordinator of Ashar Alo Society (AAS), a non governmental organization gives HIV/AIDs treatment, said that about 508 patients have been admitted under this society. Of them about 37 are Rohingya refugees, who had been staying here for few years. But recently one Rohingya refugee was identified as HIV/AIDs carrier, who crossed Myanmar border after August 25 violence.

"HIV's ability to cause AIDS is weakening over time, study finds",,,,,"HIVs ability to cause AIDS is weakening over time, study finds Published : Tuesday, 2 December, 2014, Time : 4:12 PM, View Count : 22 Rapid evolution of HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, is slowing its ability to cause AIDS, according to a study of more than 2,000 women in Africa. Scientists said the research suggests a less virulent HIV could be one of several factors contributing to a turning of the deadly pandemic, eventually leading to the end of AIDS. ""Overall we are bringing down the ability of HIV to cause AIDS so quickly,"" Philip Goulder, a professor at Oxford University who led the study, said in a telephone interview. ""But it would be overstating it to say HIV has lost its potency -- its still a virus you wouldnt want to have."" Some 35 million people currently have HIV and AIDS has killed around 40 million people since it began spreading 30 years ago. But campaigners noted on Monday that for the first time in the epidemics history, the annual number of new HIV infections is lower than the number of HIV positive people being added to those receiving treatment, meaning a crucial tipping point has been reached in reducing deaths from AIDS. Goulders team conducted their study in Botswana and South Africa -- two countries badly hit by AIDS -- where they enrolled more than 2,000 women with HIV. First they looked at whether the interaction between the bodys natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent or able to cause disease. Previous research on HIV has shown that people with a gene known as HLA-B*57 can benefit from a protective effect against HIV and progress more slowly than usual to AIDS. The scientists found that in Botswana, HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B*57 more than in South Africa, so patients no longer benefited from the protective effect. But they also found the cost of this adaptation for HIV is a reduced ability to replicate -- making it less virulent. The scientists then analyzed the impact on HIV virulence of the wide use of AIDS drugs. Using a mathematical model, they found that treating the sickest HIV patients -- whose immune systems have been weakened by the infection -- accelerates the evolution of variants of HIV with a weaker ability to replicate. ""HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate,"" Goulder said.

All these issues will be discussed in the upcoming 22nd International AIDS Conference 2018 scheduled to be held on 23rd July, a five-day programme, in the Netherlands capital Amsterdam. The theme of AIDS 2018 is Breaking Barriers, Building Bridges is drawing attention to the need of rights-based approaches to more effectively reach key populations, including in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the North-African/Middle Eastern regions where epidemics are growing. The number is much higher in female injecting drug users than male including commercial sex workers is posing serious risks to the life of the young generation. Pulock Raha, an expert of Unicef, said Bangladesh is still considered to be a low prevalence country in regards of HIV/ AIDs. ""Bangladesh is in the unique position to succeed to keep the AIDS epidemic from expanding. He also noted that the success behind this mission is taking comprehensive and strategically viable preventive measures."" He also noted that the migrant workers are an important group which should be prioritized in the Bangladesh National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS. The first case of HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh was detected in 1989. Since then 1495 cases of HIV/AIDS have been reported (as of December 2008). However UNAIDS estimates that the number of people living with HIV in the country may be as high as 12,000, which is within the range of the low estimate by UNICEFs State of the Worlds Children Report 2009. The overall prevalence of HIV in Bangladesh is less than 1%. However, high levels of HIV infection have been found among injecting drug users (7% in one part of the capital city, Dhaka1 ). But other experts said Bangladesh remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic given its dire poverty, overpopulation, gender inequality and high levels of transactional sex. Zia Ahmed, a HIV/ AIDS expert, said due to limited access to voluntary counseling and testing services very few Bangladeshis are aware of their HIV status. He suggested the mass awareness is very much needed for preventing such trend. He also noted that injecting drug users, sex workers and men having sex with men are considered most at-risk groups to HIV infection in Bangladesh. The latest report conducted by UNAIDS suggests Bangladesh stands at the tenth position in HIV deaths among Asian countries. The report suggests that Bangladesh lost around 1,000 people in 2016 due to AIDs, says the report. India has the highest number of deaths in Asia as per the report. The disease claimed 62,000 lives in India the same year. The report also reveals a worrying fact that in the case of Bangladesh about 68 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) felt ashamed and 54 percent felt guilty due to their HIV-positive status. AIDS 2018 aims to promote human rights based and evidence-informed HIV responses that are tailored to the needs of particularly vulnerable communities -- including people living with HIV, displaced populations, men who have sex with men, people in closed settings, people who use drugs, sex workers, transgender people, women and girls and young people--and collaborate in fighting the disease beyond country borders.",{},"['low', 'injecting', 'bd', 'noted', 'hiv', 'workers', 'aids', 'experts', 'prevalence', 'users', 'high', 'bangladesh', 'men', 'report', 'sex', 'vulnerability']","Bangladesh is being considered a low prevalence country in terms of HIV/AIDS but it remains extremely vulnerable to an HIV epidemic given its dire poverty, experts say.

HIV re-emerges in 'cured' girl,,,,,"MISSISSIPPI, July 14: A baby girl in the US born with HIV and believed cured after very early treatment has now been found to still harbour the virus. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told US media the new results were ""obviously disappointing"" and had possible implications on an upcoming federal HIV study. ""Were going to take a good hard look at the study and see if it needs any modifications,"" he said. There was huge hope that the ""Mississippi baby"" would live a life free of the HIV. Antiretroviral drugs can keep the virus in check in the bloodstream, but HIV has hiding places - known as reservoirs - in the gut and brain. If treatment stops, then the virus emerges from its reservoirs and begins its assault afresh. Doctors had hoped that starting drug treatment within hours of birth would prevent the reservoirs forming. This seems not to have been the case. This case was never going to lead to an HIV-cure for infected adults, who begin treatment months or years after infection. The Mississippi baby has become a reminder of how difficult HIV is to defeat and how distant a cure really is. The child, nicknamed the ""Mississippi baby"", did not receive any pre-natal HIV care. Because of a greater risk of infection, she was started on a powerful HIV treatment just hours after labour. She continued to receive treatment until 18 months old, when doctors could not locate her. When she returned 10 months later, no sign of infection was evident though her mother had not given her HIV medication in the interim. Repeated tests showed no detectable HIV virus until last week. Doctors do not yet know why the virus re-emerged. A second child with HIV was given early treatment just hours after birth in Los Angeles in April 2013. Subsequent tests indicate she completely cleared the virus, but that child also received ongoing treatment. Only one adult is currently believed to have been cured of HIV. In 2007, Timothy Ray Brown received a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV. He has shown no signs of infection for more than five years. ?BBC ONLINE",{},"['reemerges', 'months', 'girl', 'hiv', 'child', 'treatment', 'reservoirs', 'mississippi', 'infection', 'cured', 'hours', 'baby', 'virus']","MISSISSIPPI, July 14: A baby girl in the US born with HIV and believed cured after very early treatment has now been found to still harbour the virus.

HIV \'wave\' feared in Central Asia,,,,,"Pavol Stracansky Healthcare systems in Eastern Europe and Central Asia remain woefully unable to cope with HIV/AIDS as the regions raging epidemic - the fastest growing in the world - takes on a new dimension, a senior UN official has told IPS. Until now the Eastern Europe and Central Asia epidemic had been driven by injection drug use. But data and anecdotal evidence has shown a strong rise in the spread of the disease through heterosexual transmission as well as via men who have sex with men - potentially throwing up a new set of challenges for governments and healthcare ministers. But, says the UN Secretary Generals Special Envoy on HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Michel Kazatchkine, until a new approach to treating the disease is taken in countries worst affected by it, the response to the epidemic will continue to be poor and largely ineffective. He told IPS: ""HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia needs to be taken out of the medical ghetto which it is in at the moment. ""Regardless of whether it is driven by heterosexual transmission or drug-injection, I am afraid that until the disease gets visibility and health systems get geared up to take it on, it will not be dealt with properly. In some countries it will probably take a wave of deaths, or the death of someone famous or a prominent member of the church for anything to change."" For many years Eastern Europe and Central Asia has had the worlds fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. The estimated number of people with HIV has grown by 140% in the past 10 years, according to UN figures. Russia has 70% of all people living with HIV in the region and together with the Ukraine accounts for 90% of the regions HIV infection cases. The epidemic remains primarily linked with injection drug use with over 35% of case reports in the region associated with drug use. But in the last five years, there has been a marked increase in heterosexual transmission which now accounts for 30% of reported cases, according to Kazatchkine. Much of this is believed to be between male drug users and women. However, the exposure route of 40% of infections in the region is classified as ""unknown"". It is thought that most of these are among men who have sex with men. Discrimination, persecution and stigmatization of homosexuals, drug users and people with HIV/AIDS means that it is impossible to collect accurate data on the spread of the disease. ?www.ipsnews.net",{},"['transmission', 'eastern', 'hiv', 'wave', 'feared', 'region', 'central', 'epidemic', 'europe', 'asia', 'men', 'hivaids', 'drug']","Pavol StracanskyHealthcare systems in Eastern Europe and Central Asia remain woefully unable to cope with HIV/AIDS as the region's raging epidemic - the fastest growing in the world - takes on a new dimension, a senior UN official has told IPS.

Cows could hold key to beating HIV,"WASHINGTON, July 21: Cows have shown an",,,The Daily Observer,"WASHINGTON, July 21: Cows have shown an ""insane"" and ""mind-blowing"" ability to tackle HIV which will help develop a vaccine, say US researchers. In a first for immunisation, the animals rapidly produced special types of antibody that can neutralise HIV. It is thought cows evolved a supreme immune defence due to their complex and bacteria-packed digestive system. The US National Institutes of Health said the findings were of ""great interest"". HIV is a slippery and nefarious opponent. It mutates so readily that every time a patients immune system finds a way of attacking the virus, HIV shifts its appearance. However, a small proportion of patients eventually develop ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" after years of infection. These attack parts the virus cannot change. A vaccine that could train the immune system to make broadly neutralising antibodies should help prevent people being infected in the first place. But no jab can do the job. Then researchers at the International Aids Vaccine Initiative and the Scripps Research Institute tried immunising cows. ""The response blew our minds,"" Dr Devin Sok, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website. The required antibodies were being produced by the cows immune system in a matter of weeks. Dr Sok added: ""It was just insane how good it looked, in humans it takes three-to-five years to develop the antibodies were talking about. ""This is really important because we hadnt been able to do it period. ""Who would have thought cow biology was making a significant contribution to HIV."" The results, published in the journal Nature, showed the cows antibodies could neutralise 20% of HIV strains within 42 days. By 381 days, they could neutralise 96% of strains tested in the lab. Dr Dennis Burton, a fellow researcher, said: ""The potent responses in this study are remarkable. ""Unlike human antibodies, cattle antibodies are more likely to bear unique features and gain an edge over HIV."" Unusually for human antibodies, the broadly neutralising ones have a long and loopy structure. Cow antibodies are inherently more long and loopy. So the cow immune system finds making the antibodies easily. It is thought the cows ""ruminant"" digestive system which ferments grass in order to digest it is a Wild West of hostile bacteria. So the animals have developed the antibodies needed to keep them in check. It means cattle could eventually become a source of drugs to make more effective vaginal microbicides to prevent HIV infection. However, the real goal is to develop a vaccine that encourages the human immune system to make the antibodies it currently finds a struggle. That remains a significant challenge, but the cattle study could help point the way. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: ""From the early days of the epidemic, we have recognized that HIV is very good at evading immunity, so exceptional immune systems that naturally produce broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV are of great interest - whether they belong to humans or cattle."" —BBC",{},"['antibodies', 'vaccine', 'hiv', 'key', 'develop', 'hold', 'system', 'beating', 'cattle', 'thought', 'cows', 'immune', 'broadly']","It is thought cows evolved a supreme immune defence due to their complex and bacteria-packed digestive system.

"AIDS: Symptoms, causes and preventions","AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) was first recognized in North America in the early 1980s. It is caused by a virus known as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV infection has become epidemic worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that since its discovery, it has caused 36 million deaths worldwide.Causes:Anyone can contract HIV. The virus is transmitted in bodily fluids that include:* Blood* Semen* Vaginal and rectal fluids* Breast milkSome of the ways HIV is spread from person to person include:* Through vaginal or anal sex - the most common route of transmission, especially among men who have sex with men* By sharing needles, syringes, and other items for injection drug use* By sharing tattoo equipment without sterilizing it between uses* During pregnancy, labor, or delivery from a woman to her baby* During breastfeeding* Through",,2018-12-07,The Daily Observer,"AIDS: Symptoms, causes and preventions Causes: Anyone can contract HIV. The virus is transmitted in bodily fluids that include: * Blood * Semen * Vaginal and rectal fluids * Breast milk Some of the ways HIV is spread from person to person include: * Through vaginal or anal sex - the most common route of transmission, especially among men who have sex with men * By sharing needles, syringes, and other items for injection drug use * By sharing tattoo equipment without sterilizing it between uses * During pregnancy, labor, or delivery from a woman to her baby * During breastfeeding * Through ""pre-mastication,"" or chewing a babys food before feeding it to them * Through exposure to the blood of someone living with HIV, such as through a needle stick Dr Monzur Hussain Chowdhury Medical Officer ICDDR,B Symptoms: The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Possible signs and symptoms include: * Fever * Headache * Muscle aches and joint pain * Rash * Sore throat and painful mouth sores * Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if youre not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells - the cells in your body that help fight off germs - you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: * Fever * Fatigue * Swollen lymph nodes - often one of the first signs of HIV infection * Diarrhea * Weight loss * Oral yeast infection (thrush) * Shingles (herpes zoster) Complications HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis (TB): In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Its a leading cause of death among people with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus: This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces - causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs. Candidiasis: Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on the mucous membranes of your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina. Cryptococcal meningitis: Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil. Toxoplasmosis: This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. Cryptosporidiosis: This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite thats commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS Prevention Theres no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection. To help prevent the spread of HIV: Use a new condom every time you have sex: Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Women can use a female condom. If using lubricant, make sure its water-based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. During oral sex use a non-lubricated, cut-open condom or a dental dam - a piece of medical-grade latex. Tell your sexual partners if you have HIV: Its important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that youre HIV-positive. Theyll need to be tested. Use a clean needle: If you use a needle to inject drugs, make sure its sterile and dont share it. Take advantage of needle-exchange programs in your community and consider seeking help for your drug use. If youre pregnant, get medical care right away: If youre HIV-positive, you may pass the infection to your baby. But if you receive treatment during pregnancy, you can cut your babys risk significantly. Consider male circumcision: Theres evidence that male circumcision can help reduce a mans risk of getting HIV infection. HIV and AIDS myths and facts: Many misconceptions circulate about HIV that are harmful and stigmatizing for people with the virus. The following cannot transmit the virus: * Shaking hands * Hugging * Sneezing * Touching unbroken skin * Using the same toilet * Sharing towels * Sharing cutlery AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) was first recognized in North America in the early 1980s. It is caused by a virus known as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV infection has become epidemic worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that since its discovery, it has caused 36 million deaths worldwide.Causes:Anyone can contract HIV. The virus is transmitted in bodily fluids that include:* Blood* Semen* Vaginal and rectal fluids* Breast milkSome of the ways HIV is spread from person to person include:* Through vaginal or anal sex - the most common route of transmission, especially among men who have sex with men* By sharing needles, syringes, and other items for injection drug use* By sharing tattoo equipment without sterilizing it between uses* During pregnancy, labor, or delivery from a woman to her baby* During breastfeeding* Through ""pre-mastication,"" or chewing a babys food before feeding it to them* Through exposure to the blood of someone living with HIV, such as through a needle stickThe virus can also be transmitted through a blood transfusion or organ and tissue transplant.Symptoms:The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.Primary infection (Acute HIV)Possible signs and symptoms include:* Fever* Headache* Muscle aches and joint pain* Rash* Sore throat and painful mouth sores* Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neckThese symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV)In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells.This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if youre not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner.Symptomatic HIV infectionAs the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells - the cells in your body that help fight off germs - you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:* Fever* Fatigue* Swollen lymph nodes - often one of the first signs of HIV infection* Diarrhea* Weight loss* Oral yeast infection (thrush)* Shingles (herpes zoster)ComplicationsHIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers.Infections common to HIV/AIDSTuberculosis (TB): In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Its a leading cause of death among people with AIDS.Cytomegalovirus: This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces - causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.Candidiasis: Candidiasis is a common HIV-related infection. It causes inflammation and a thick, white coating on the mucous membranes of your mouth, tongue, esophagus or vagina.Cryptococcal meningitis: Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil.Toxoplasmosis: This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats.

Bangladesh at high risk of HIV,,,,,"Bangladesh at high risk of HIV/AIDS: Experts Observer Online Desk Published :Thursday, 28 April, 2016, Time : 6:30 PM View Count : 22 Although there is low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the country, Bangladesh is still at high risk of the deadly disease due to its demographic transition and easy access to drugs, say experts. “Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country, but it can’t be said we’ re free from HIV risk,” director general of the Directorate General of Family Planning Mohammad Wahid Hossain told a seminar on Thursday.

More resources needed in nat?l fight against HIV menace,,,,,"More resources needed in nat?l fight against HIV menace Published :Sunday, 29 November, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 18 Fighting the HIV Aids infection in Bangladesh may face a huge challenge in future due to resource constraints according to a leading NGO, as it called for expanded coverage and quality interventions for the people who are at highest risk of HIV. ""Although HIV-infected cases have been reduced in Bangladesh, there are some certain groups who are vulnerable to HIV and there is a chance of their spreading it. But we have no adequate resources or funds to address these groups,"" deputy director of Save the Children Sheikh Masudul Alam told a press briefing on Saturday. Citing a UNAIDS report, he said Bangladesh spent US$ 19.4 million on the AIDS response in 2014, with only US$ 2.9 million of the total expenditure coming from domestic resources. In 2014, Masudul Alam said, an estimated 138 mothers needed the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) services, but only 25 mothers received the service, which amounted to just 18 percent of mothers needing PMTCT services. For lack of resources, around 63 children were infected with HIV in 2014 due to the mother to child transmission, he added. National AIDS/STD Programme under the Health Ministry, The Global Fund, Save the Children and Dhaka Ahsania Mission jointly organised the media briefing at Ahsania Mission office in the capital ahead of the World AIDS Day to be observed on December 1. Making his presentation, Masudul Alam said globally 36.9 million people are living with HIV and new HIV infections among adults and children were estimated at 2 million in 2014, a 35 percent decline since 2000. In Bangladesh in 2014, it was estimated that 8,900 people were living with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, while 433 were reportedly infected in 2014. Some 563 deaths occurred last year due to the disease. ""In 2014, it was estimated that 309 children (aged 0-14 years) were living with HIV. The children have been infected mainly by mother to child transmission,"" he said. UNAIDS data showed that 799 young people were living with HIV in Bangladesh in 2014. The reported number of new cases of HIV in 2014 among this group was 58. Women accounted for 30 percent of newly reported cases. Masudul Alam said HIV is more prevalent among those who inject drugs, migrant workers, sex workers, male homosexuals and members of the transgender community in the country. ""HIV-affected people easily fall prey to tuberculosis (TB) as their immune system is disabled. TB is still a health burden to us. Screening is required in this regard,"" he said. Director General of Press Institute of Bangladesh (PIB) Mohammad Shah Alamgir Hossain, Dhaka Ahsania Mission president Kazi Rafiqul Alam and its deputy director Iqbal Masud also spoke the press briefing. The speakers urged the mass media to play their role to create awareness among people about HIV/AIDS for prevention of the deadly disease and thus saving people from dangerous consequences. They said community-based HIV prevention and treatment as well as interventions involving marginalised groups need to be scaled up and made available to hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups. Stressing the need for increasing financial allocation for successful HIV prevention programmes, the speakers said target groups need special attention and they should be provided with necessary services. ?UNB",{},"['children', 'natl', 'transmission', 'menace', 'hiv', 'resources', 'prevention', 'fight', 'million', 'bangladesh', 'estimated', 'alam', 'groups', 'needed', 'living']","For lack of resources, around 63 children were infected with HIV in 2014 due to the mother to child transmission, he added.

HIV home test kit goes on sale in UK,,,,,"HIV home test kit goes on sale in UK Published : Wednesday, 29 April, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 15 The first legally approved HIV self-test kit that allows people to get a result in 15 minutes at home has gone on sale in England, Scotland and Wales. Unlike other kits, these tests do not need to be sent off to a lab to get the results. It works by detecting antibodies on a small drop of blood, which are often only detectable three months after the infection is caught. Experts warn that any positive tests must be reconfirmed at clinics. Charities hope it will reduce some of the 26,000 people estimated to have undiagnosed HIV in the UK. An early diagnosis allows people to get treatment quickly and can prevent serious complications. And individuals successfully treated for HIV are less likely to pass the infection on. This new do-it-yourself test is made by company Bio Sure UK and can be bought online. It works in a similar way to a pregnancy test, measuring levels of antibodies - proteins made in response to the virus - in a persons blood. The device analyses a small droplet of blood, taken from the finger-tip using a lancet. Two purple lines appear if it is positive. The company recommends attending sexual health clinics for advice and further blood tests if both lines appear. And even if the test is negative experts say it does not mean people are definitely virus free - especially if exposure occurred within the last three months. The three-month window period, between the moment someone catches the infection and the time it can take for antibodies to develop, means the kit is not reliable during this time. ?BBC News The first legally approved HIV self-test kit that allows people to get a result in 15 minutes at home has gone on sale in England, Scotland and Wales.Unlike other kits, these tests do not need to be sent off to a lab to get the results.It works by detecting antibodies on a small drop of blood, which are often only detectable three months after the infection is caught.Experts warn that any positive tests must be reconfirmed at clinics.Charities hope it will reduce some of the 26,000 people estimated to have undiagnosed HIV in the UK.

‘Dangerous complacency’ to global HIV epidemic risks resurgence,A,,2018-07-22,The Daily Observer,"‘Dangerous complacency’ to global HIV epidemic risks resurgence Experts said a stalling of HIV funding in recent years was endangering efforts to control the illness. As things stand, the world is no longer on course to end the pandemic by 2030 - a target agreed by UN member states, say experts in The Lancet. They call for urgent changes in how the disease is treated and controlled. About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids. And there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. New cases of HIV/Aids have been falling in recent years. But the Lancet Commission said the fall was happening too slowly to reach the UNAids target of 500,000 new infections by 2020. While HIV rates were falling overall, they remained persistent in marginalised groups, younger people - particularly women - and in developing countries, all of whom were less likely to access treatment, the commission said. Experts said HIV funding had remained flat in recent years, at about £14.7bn - roughly £5.4bn short of the estimated amount needed to achieve the UNAids targets. Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International Aids Society and professor at University of Cape Town, South Africa, said: ""Despite the remarkable progress of the HIV response, the situation has stagnated in the past decade. ""Reinvigorating this work will be demanding - but the future health and wellbeing of millions of people require that we meet this challenge."" The Lancet Commission also called for more collaboration between health professionals and for HIV treatment to become better incorporated into other areas of healthcare. This would mean an end to HIV ""exceptionalism"", where specific funding and services have been provided for HIV alone, and could include combining HIV screening with screening for other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. In India, for example, if HIV testing and treatments were combined with those for syphilis among women sex workers and gay men it could reduce the number of new HIV cases at a national-level by 7% between 2018 and 2028, the report estimated. ""Health systems must be designed to meet the needs of the people they serve, including having the capacity to address multiple health problems simultaneously,"" Prof Chris Beyrer said.

HIV patients with undetectable virus unlikely to infect partner,"When drugs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) suppress the virus in the blood to very low levels, patients are unlikely to infect their partners during condomless sex, suggests a new study. After following nearly 900 heterosexual and gay couples for an average of 16 months, researchers found no evidence that uninfected partners became infected after condomless sex with an HIV-positive partner with viral suppression. This good news bolsters the role of HIV treatment as a form of prevention, said lead author Dr. Alison Rodger, of the University College London.",,2016-07-15,The Daily Observer,"HIV patients with undetectable virus unlikely to infect partner After following nearly 900 heterosexual and gay couples for an average of 16 months, researchers found no evidence that uninfected partners became infected after condomless sex with an HIV-positive partner with viral suppression. This good news bolsters the role of HIV treatment as a form of prevention, said lead author Dr. Alison Rodger, of the University College London. ""I think the big push now should be to expand testing, getting people diagnosed and get them on treatment,"" Rodger told Reuters Health. Past studies have suggested that the risk of passing the virus to an HIV-negative person was low for people with low levels of HIV in their blood because of antiretroviral therapy (ART). One study, involving mostly heterosexual couples, found people who started taking ART early in their infection were 96 percent less likely to pass HIV to a partner, compared to people who delayed treatment. But participants in that study regularly used condoms, which also reduce the risk of transmission, Rodger and her colleagues write in JAMA. The new study, conducted in 14 European countries, involved couples with one HIV-positive partner and one HIV-negative partner who had unprotected sex with each other. In the HIV-positive partner, the viral load had to be less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood. Overall, the 548 heterosexual and 340 gay couples reported about 60,000 unprotected sex acts during the study. While 11 of the HIV-negative study participants became HIV positive, those infections could not be traced back to the HIV-positive partner. Laboratory testing showed the new infections were different from the virus in the HIV-positive partners. About 33 percent of gay participants and 4 percent of heterosexual participants who were HIV-negative at the start of the study reported condomless sex with other partners, the researchers write. Past research, Rodger said, suggests the risk of transmission is very low among heterosexual couples in which the HIV-positive partner has undetectable levels of the virus in their blood. But there was very little data on men in sexual relationships with other men, Rodger said, adding that more research is needed on the risk of transmission during condomless anal sex. —Reuters When drugs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) suppress the virus in the blood to very low levels, patients are unlikely to infect their partners during condomless sex, suggests a new study.After following nearly 900 heterosexual and gay couples for an average of 16 months, researchers found no evidence that uninfected partners became infected after condomless sex with an HIV-positive partner with viral suppression.This good news bolsters the role of HIV treatment as a form of prevention, said lead author Dr. Alison Rodger, of the University College London.""I think the big push now should be to expand testing, getting people diagnosed and get them on treatment,"" Rodger told Reuters Health.Past studies have suggested that the risk of passing the virus to an HIV-negative person was low for people with low levels of HIV in their blood because of antiretroviral therapy (ART).One study, involving mostly heterosexual couples, found people who started taking ART early in their infection were 96 percent less likely to pass HIV to a partner, compared to people who delayed treatment.But participants in that study regularly used condoms, which also reduce the risk of transmission, Rodger and her colleagues write in JAMA.The new study, conducted in 14 European countries, involved couples with one HIV-positive partner and one HIV-negative partner who had unprotected sex with each other.

In India, only about 7% of sex work takes place from brothels; mostly, it is practised from homes and in the streets, these sex workers forming an ""invisible majority"" of those who had to be reached out to. Hence, the Thai governments successful intervention in the 1990s to create awareness about HIV prevention and stop unprotected sex work was difficult to replicate here; ""large, well-regulated, legal brothels are a boon for HIV prevention,"" Alexander finds out. The other challenge came from sex workers themselves.

Alexander recounts the complexity through the experience of Ashodaya in Mysuru, which mobilised the sex worker community into running the programme. They had to first build trust by providing them what they needed most: security, and not just from physical violence and police harassment. Crucial was a safe place to meet, and a clinic of their own they could visit without being stigmatised. It was a successful experiment that still continues.

Led by Ruth Ruprecht, M.D., Ph.D., the team used an animal model to show for the first time that an antibody called Immunoglobulin M (IgM) was effective in preventing infection after mucosal AIDS virus exposure. Worldwide, an estimated 90% of new cases of HIV-1 are caused through exposure in the mucosal cavities like the inside lining of the rectum or vagina. ""IgM is sort of the forgotten antibody,"" Dr. Ruprecht, Scientist and Director of Texas Biomeds AIDS Research Program, said. ""Most scientists believed its protective effect was too short-lived to be leveraged as any kind of protective shield against an invading pathogen like HIV-1."" The study is published in the July 17, 2018 edition of the journal AIDS. The article is listed as ""Fast Track,"" indicating these new and exciting data should get special attention. Rhesus monkeys at the Southwest National Primate Research Center on the Texas Biomed campus served as models for the in vivo study. Scientists first treated the animals with a man-made version of IgM, which is naturally produced by plasma cells located under the epithelium (the surface lining of body cavities). Half an hour later, the same animals were exposed to SHIV (simian-human immunodeficiency virus). Four out of the six animals treated this way were fully protected against the virus. The animals were monitored for 82 days. Dr. Ruprechts team found that applying the IgM antibodies resulted in what is called immune exclusion. IgM clumped up the virus, preventing it from crossing the mucosal barrier and spreading to the rest of the body. The technique of introducing pre-formed antibodies into the body to create immunity is known as passive immunization. IgM has a high affinity for its antigens and ""grabs them very quickly and does not let go,"" Dr. Ruprecht explained. ""Our study reveals for the first time the protective potential of mucosal anti-HIV-1 IgM. IgM has a five-times higher ability to bind to virus particles compared to the standard antibody form called IgG. It basically opens up a new area of research. IgM can do more than it has been given credit."" An accompanying editorial says Dr. Ruprecht has ""set off a new wave in evaluating the activity of IgM antibodies in neutralizing HIV-1...[and she and her group] have largely broadened the horizon of neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies, which, as single or combined agents, may be used for HIV-1 prevention and treatment.""

Adequate step to prevent HIV/AIDS a must,,,,,"RANGPUR, Feb 12: There is no alternative to creating adequate awareness for preventing threat of spreading HIV/AIDS through disseminating proper education, knowledge and social values among the vulnerable group people, reports BSS. Speakers said this at a community advocacy meeting on HIV Prevention and Control among High Risk Population and Vulnerable Young People in Bangladesh organised by Rangpur Drop-in-Centre (DIC)-1 of Help and Education for Least-privileged People (HELP) at its office here on Tuesday afternoon. Noted educationist Abul Hossain presided over the meeting participated by community leaders, transport workers, teachers, public representatives, social workers, religious leaders, civil society members, hijra community people, journalists and elite. Coordinator of Rangpur DIC-1 of HELP Chhomir Uddin presented the keynote paper narrating the present HIV/AIDS situation and activities of the organisation in expanding provision of essential services to street based and hotel/residence based sex workers. Outreach Supervisor of Rangpur DIC-1 of the NGO Rashedul Islam, Field Officers Mohammad Ronny and Reajul Haque Shah, journalists Badal Rahman, businessmen Sajjadur Rahman Shimul, Omar Faruk took part in the open discussion, among others. The speakers said the killer HIV-AIDS diseases have been posing formidable threats to human life and social health with possibilities of further spreading everywhere, as the situation in the neighbouring countries is already vulnerable. The situation could turn worse if the vulnerable group people continue their unsafe sexual habit and blood donation as those increase possibility of spreading the HIV/AIDS and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), they said.",{},"['social', 'prevent', 'help', 'dic1', 'community', 'rangpur', 'step', 'vulnerable', 'spreading', 'situation', 'adequate', 'hivaids', 'workers']","RANGPUR, Feb 12: There is no alternative to creating adequate awareness for preventing threat of spreading HIV/AIDS through disseminating proper education, knowledge and social values among the vulnerable group people, reports BSS.

Almost half of HIV patients worldwide are unaware of being infected: WHO,"The World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that nearly half of all people with HIV around the globe do not know they are infected, and called for broader access to at-home testing kits.The UN health agency said that 40 per cent of people with the virus that causes AIDS, or more than 14 million people worldwide, are unaware of their status, according to 2015 estimates.However, that marks a huge improvement from a decade earlier when only 12 per cent of people with HIV were estimated to know they had the virus.But the continued lack of diagnoses remains a major obstacle to implementing WHO's recommendation for everyone with HIV to be offered anti-retroviral therapy (ART).Today, more than 80 per cent of those diagnosed with HIV are receiving ART, but that is still less than half of the 36.7 million people believed to be living with the virus.",,2016-12-02,The Daily Observer,"Almost half of HIV patients worldwide are unaware of being infected: WHO The UN health agency said that 40 per cent of people with the virus that causes AIDS, or more than 14 million people worldwide, are unaware of their status, according to 2015 estimates. However, that marks a huge improvement from a decade earlier when only 12 per cent of people with HIV were estimated to know they had the virus. But the continued lack of diagnoses remains a major obstacle to implementing WHOs recommendation for everyone with HIV to be offered anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Almost half of HIV patients worldwide are unaware of being infected: WHO ""We still have a major treatment gap,"" Gottfried Hirnschall, head of WHOs HIV department, told reporters in Geneva, warning that ""many people actually get to treatment late because they dont know they are HIV positive"". WHO chief Margaret Chan said that making home testing kits more easily available could make a dramatic difference. ""HIV self-testing should open the door for many more people to know their HIV status and find out how to get treatment and access prevention services,"" she said in a statement. HIV self-testing allows people, in the privacy of their own homes, to use oral fluid or blood from a finger prick to determine their status in about 20 minutes, while new tests are being developed that work even faster. Record infections WHO urges anyone who tests positive to seek confirmatory tests at a health clinic, where they can receive information about the disease and how to get counselling, as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services. Self-testing has been shown to nearly double the frequency of HIV testing among men who have sex with men, and recent studies in Kenya found that the male partners of pregnant women were twice as likely to get tested if they were offered self-testing, WHO said. Twenty-three countries currently have national policies in place supporting HIV self-testing while others are developing such policies, but WHO warned that in much of the world wide-scale access to the tests remains limited. And in countries where they are easily accessible they are often pricey, as in the United States where they can be bought in most chemists at around $40 (37.67 euros) a piece. ""We would really like to emphasise that they should ideally be free,"" said Rachel Baggaley of WHOs HIV prevention unit. WHO said it was supporting a project in three southern African countries - Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia - aimed at making free home testing kits widely available, and said a number of other countries were interested in joining the initiative. More testing is also needed in other regions, with the EU and WHO reporting on Tuesday that one in seven people with HIV in Europe is unaware of their infection, as 2015 marked another record year for new HIV cases in the region. Europe registered 153,407 new cases, up from 142,000 in 2014, the WHO said, a jump driven by cases in Russia and immigrants who acquired the virus after arrival.

Between India and Africa's health,,,,,"Between India and Africas health Nilanjan Banik & Philip Stevens Published :Tuesday, 1 December, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 16 At last months India-Africa summit in Delhi, Prime Minister Modi met 54 African heads of state to discuss ways of deepening economic and security relationships between these countries. Also on the agenda was public health, with the two sides exploring how to work together to improve healthcare. For India, pharmaceuticals remain one of its main exports to Africa, making up around 16 per cent of total exported items, with India supplying 85 per cent of all of anti-retroviral drugs used to treat HIV. African ministers, meanwhile, are keen to learn from and follow Indias success in developing a powerhouse drug manufacturing sector, both to secure their own medicine supplies and to give their economies a fillip. It is encouraging to see lower and middle-income countries, like India and those in Africa, taking charge of their own human and economic development priorities, without intervention from the West, and India can certainly be proud of its role in driving down the cost of HIV treatment in Africa and elsewhere through its supply of cheap drugs. It would be unwise, however, to assume that what has worked for HIV will work for all the other myriad health problems faced by India and the African nations. HIV has been singled out for attention by Western governments, who have poured billions of dollars into building up the health infrastructure required to treat patients, in addition to paying for a large proportion of the (largely Indian made) anti-retroviral drugs currently relied on by African patients. These days, outside a handful of sub-Saharan African countries, like South Africa, HIV/AIDS is only a small part of the disease landscape in developing countries, constituting only 3.1 per cent of all deaths (0.77 per cent in India). Far more people die from heart disease, stroke and lung disease. Amongst the poorest in African countries, and also in India easily treatable diseases, such as diarrhoea, remain a leading cause of death. India manufactures vast quantities of cheap medicines that could slash death rates for these diseases across Africa and India. The sad reality is that these medicines are simply not getting to those who need them, both at home and abroad. India itself, home to 3,000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 drugs factories, struggles to make even the most basic medicines available to its citizens. One recent survey showed that in New Delhi, essential medicines are available in only a quarter of state-government facilities, which are the primary source of free medicines for a majority of Indias low-income population. Things are equally bleak across sub-Saharan Africa where clinics and pharmacies frequently fail to stock basic medicines such as antibiotics. Then there is the question of affordability. Even the cheapest off-patent medicines are unaffordable to the majority of people in India and Africa. A single asthma inhaler can cost 50 days wages in Mozambique, while in India it can cost 2.3 days wages for the lowest paid government worker. These prices are unaffordable to most people, compounded by long-term failures by African and the Indian states to create workable health insurance models. These failures lead to 63 million Indians sinking into poverty each year as a result of healthcare costs, something that rarely happens in OECD countries. Even if medicines are provided for free, it means little if the health infrastructure is not there to deliver them. There are only 0.7 physicians per 1000 population in India, well below the 3 to 4 seen in most high-income countries. Things are even worse in Africa: most countries dont record data but in Zambia and Zimbabwe, two countries that do, the figure is 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. These are terrible statistics that are unlikely to improve while governments spend so little on health. In 2001, 189 African governments committed to spending 15 per cent of total government expenditure on health, the minimum amount recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Only Rwanda, Botswana, Zambia and Togo have met this commitment, whereas 19 Africa countries actually now spend less. India, meanwhile, only spends a dismal 4.3 per cent of government expenditure on health - nowhere near enough. But to truly improve healthcare in India and Africa, there needs to be much greater focus on the basics - recruiting and training staff, building infrastructure, working on pharmaceutical supply chains, committing funds and ensuring people have some form of insurance.r Nilanjan Banik is a professor of economics at Mahindra Ecole Centrale and a fellow at CUTS International.

UN backs BD proposal for extension of WTO waiver on pharma patents,,,,,"UN backs BD proposal for extension of WTO waiver on pharma patents Business Correspondent Published : Sunday, 24 May, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 14 Two leading bodies of the United Nations have supported a request made by Bangladesh at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for extending Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) beyond its current deadline of 1 January 2016. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in a joint statement on Thursday said they backed Bangladeshs proposal made at the WTO in February last for extension of TRIPS LDC Waiver. and is now before the The proposal now being considered by the WTO TRIPS Council sought for an extension of the period under which LDCs are exempt from applying protections for pharmaceutical related patents and clinical data. ""Millions of people rely on access to affordable, assured quality generic medicines,"" the statement quoted UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé as saying, ""WTO Members have before them a critical opportunity to help least-developed countries to reach health and sustainable development goals-failure to support them could put millions of lives at risk,"" he was further quoted in the statement. The classification of LDCs is contingent on a number of key human development indicators, including levels of poverty, literacy and infant mortality. Access to adequate healthcare, including affordable medicines, remains a key challenge in most LDCs affecting millions of lives. The flexible intellectual property arrangements currently available to LDCs are a crucial tool for improving health. ""While much progress has been made in scaling up access to HIV treatment, much more will be required in the post-2015 era to achieve the vision of a life of dignity for all, leaving no one behind,"" the statement also quoted UNDP Administrator Helen Clark as telling. The percentage of people living with HIV who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy has been reduced from 90 per cent in 2006 to 63 per cent in 2013. LDCs and developing countries have effectively used transition periods to scale up access to treatment for HIV and its co-infections by importing or manufacturing lower-cost generic medicines. Access to medicines such as sofosbuvir used to treat chronic hepatitis C remains a grave challenge in LDCs because of high prices. Sofosbuvir can cost as much as $ 84 000 for a 12-week course in developed country markets. Lower prices via generic licenses are being offered by the patent-holder in some developing countries, but would still place a considerable burden on health budgets. A company in Bangladesh, making use of its LDC status, has launched its own version for $900 for the 12-week course. While this price is also out of reach of many patients in LDCs, with the possibility of other manufacturers emerging in LDCs there is potential for greater competition and further price reductions. There is another transition period in place which UNDP and UNAIDS have previously backed, that exempts LDCs from implementing their WTO intellectual property obligations for all fields of technology but this period expires in 2021. The proposed transition period on pharmaceutical products, for as long as an LDC remains an LDC, is necessary on top of that general transition period, for the longer-term security it would provide for patients, manufacturers, donors and LDC governments alike. In accordance with the recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, UNDP and UNAIDS urge all WTO Members to support the LDC request for a transition period on pharmaceutical related patents and clinical data for as long as a country remains an LDC. Two leading bodies of the United Nations have supported a request made by Bangladesh at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for extending Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) beyond its current deadline of 1 January 2016.The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in a joint statement on Thursday said they backed Bangladeshs proposal made at the WTO in February last for extension of TRIPS LDC Waiver. and is now before theThe proposal now being considered by the WTO TRIPS Council sought for an extension of the period under which LDCs are exempt from applying protections for pharmaceutical related patents and clinical data.""Millions of people rely on access to affordable, assured quality generic medicines,"" the statement quoted UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibé as saying,""WTO Members have before them a critical opportunity to help least-developed countries to reach health and sustainable development goals-failure to support them could put millions of lives at risk,"" he was further quoted in the statement.The classification of LDCs is contingent on a number of key human development indicators, including levels of poverty, literacy and infant mortality.Access to adequate healthcare, including affordable medicines, remains a key challenge in most LDCs affecting millions of lives. The flexible intellectual property arrangements currently available to LDCs are a crucial tool for improving health.""While much progress has been made in scaling up access to HIV treatment, much more will be required in the post-2015 era to achieve the vision of a life of dignity for all, leaving no one behind,"" the statement also quoted UNDP Administrator Helen Clark as telling.The percentage of people living with HIV who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy has been reduced from 90 per cent in 2006 to 63 per cent in 2013.LDCs and developing countries have effectively used transition periods to scale up access to treatment for HIV and its co-infections by importing or manufacturing lower-cost generic medicines.Access to medicines such as sofosbuvir used to treat chronic hepatitis C remains a grave challenge in LDCs because of high prices.

In the final round, Gray earned applause describing her work in the slums of the Philippine capital Manila. After winning she told reporters she would like to expand her work with an organisation in the Philippines that promotes education on HIV and AIDS. ""A few years ago I lost a close friend to health complications with HIV,"" she said. ""So spreading awareness on that cause and encouraging people to get the simple test and knowing their status is definitely one of my first projects that Id like to pursue."" Gray -- a student of music theory -- beat more than 90 contestants from around the globe in the 67th instalment of Miss Universe, which was held in the Thai capitals Impact Arena. During the competition, which was broadcast live, candidates were asked questions on press freedom, legalisation of marijuana, refugees and the #MeToo movement. This years event drew positive feedback for themes of inclusivity and an all-women panel of judges made up of business leaders and former Miss Universe titleholders. Miss Spains Angela Ponce made history as the first transgender candidate in a competition once owned by President Donald Trump, whose administration has attempted to block military recruitment of transgender people. ""I always say: having a vagina didnt transform me into a woman. I am a woman, already before birth, because my identity is here,"" Ponce told AFP on Saturday, gesturing to her head. She added she wanted her appearance to be empowering and that she hoped for a ""new generation of human beings who are raised a lot better, more tolerant and respectful.""

The comments went viral but Summers later posted an apology on Instagram, saying she did not ""intend to hurt"" her fellow competitors. Grays victory was closely followed in the Philippines, where beauty pageants are hugely popular.

Transgender migrant 'killed' by US,Human rights campaigners have accused the US of,,2018-05-31,The Daily Observer,"Transgender migrant killed by US Human rights campaigners have accused the US of ""institutional murder"" after a transgender immigrant died in US custody while seeking asylum. Roxana Hernandez, 33, was being held by immigration authorities in New Mexico when she fell ill. The US says the Honduran, who was HIV positive, is the sixth person to die in an immigrant detention facility in the past eight months. She had travelled in a migrant caravan disparaged by President Donald Trump. Friends say Ms Hernandez had fled violence, hate and stigma in Central America. ""She saw in the United States the opportunity to start a new life free of abuse, risk and threats,"" said a statement issued by a coalition of immigrants rights groups. After applying for asylum at the US border, Ms Hernandez was detained for deportation, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency said, citing previous convictions in Texas for theft, prostitution and illegally entering the country. According to ICE, Ms Hernandez was ""processed as an expedited removal"" when she applied for admission at the San Ysidro port of entry in California on 9 May. Six days later, on 15 May, she was transferred to the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, New Mexico. Two days after that, on 17 May, she was admitted to Cibola General Hospital ""with symptoms of pneumonia, dehydration and complications associated with HIV"". She died early in the morning of 25 May having been transferred to Lovelace Medical Center in Albuquerque by air ambulance. The preliminary cause of death was given as ""cardiac arrest."" A post-mortem examination is to be carried out. ""Roxy died due to medical negligence by US immigration authorities,"" said the three immigrant groups - Pueblo Sin Fronteras, Al Otro Lado and Diversidad Sin Fronteras - adding: ""In other words, she was murdered."" The campaigners released a statement from a fellow detainee, who wanted to be known only as Stacy, alleging that her friend had fallen ill when she was locked up for five days in a notoriously cold holding cell known as an ice box. Stacy claimed that Ms Hernandez was refused access to a doctor despite coughing, vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea and severe pain all over her body. ""The ICE officials yelled at her"" because she was sick, Stacy was quoted as saying. ""She didnt get medical care until she arrived at Cibola."" According to the organisers, Ms Hernandez was one of at least 267 members of the migrant caravan, including 23 transgender people, who crossed the border into California to apply for asylum. The immigrants rights groups are calling for dignified and humane treatment for all asylum seekers, medical care sensitive to the needs of transgender people and those with HIV, and the closure of all immigration detention centres. ICE said Ms Hernandez was the sixth detainee to die in its custody since 1 October 2017. In a statement the agency said ""the appropriate"" authorities had been notified about the death along with the consulate of Honduras in Houston, Texas, which, ICE said, would attempt to notify her next of kin. Stacy said she feared she would be next. ""Because of what happened, I feel bad and am afraid that the same could happen to me, since I have HIV,"" her statement concluded. Earlier this month, a 20-year old indigenous Guatemalan woman, Gomez Gonzalez, was shot dead in Texas by a US border patrol officer who said a group of migrants rushed towards him.

Rights of women to reproductive health,,,,,"Rights of women to reproductive health Md Sazedul Islam Published :Wednesday, 9 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 25 In Bangladesh, though many progresses have been achieved regarding womens rights, there are certain areas such as reproductive health where they are being deprived of their rights mainly due to the societys outlook. There are many teenage girls who fell to trouble because of lack of knowledge on reproductive issue. If they were aware, they could avoid undesirable situation. But the reality is different, resulting in sufferings for them. The teenage girls cannot share reproductive-related matters with their parents, hence the problem gets complicated. Awareness is very essential for dealing with the situation. According to UNICEF Bangladesh, there are 27.7 million adolescents aged 10-19 years in Bangladesh---13.7 million girls and 14 million boys---making up about one fifth of the total population. Most of the adolescents are not aware of sex education; hence they suffer from many diseases such as HIV/AIDS and many other sexual problems. Guardians are not open enough with their children. They never want to talk to their children about sex education because they think that this will decrease their sense of morality. In many situations, adolescents want to know about sex, but they do not get help or information. Proper steps are needed in this regard. These are topics of open discussions with adolescents with sex education being added to school textbooks and guardians relationships with their children being friendly. Sex is a biological affair and essential for existence for human being. Sometimes, it may cause many problems and the present world has been facing the problems immensely and HIV/AIDS is one of them. Besides HIV/AIDS, unsafe and unprotected sex cause many other problems such as sexually transmitted diseases or infection. Ignorance about sexuality, contraception, responsible sex behaviour can expedite teenage pregnancies, abortion and premature death. To solve the problems, human beings need to acquire proper knowledge on safe, healthy and protected sexual behaviour. For this reason sex education for the teenagers or school-going children is very important. Another issue is hygiene management. Teenage girls and women face severe problem in hygiene management during their menstruation period. Mothers almost never speak to daughters about menstruation, so a girls first period can be frightening for herself. Menstruation is surrounded by silent, shame and social taboos that are further manifested in social practices. In many cultures restricted mobility, freedom and normal activities and services are in practice. Women and girls in poor families tend not to seek medical help even for serious infections. On top of it, there is reluctance to discuss reproductive health issues. Most Bangladeshi families are too poor to buy sanitary pads and instead, use rags torn from old saris and other cloths. The majority of the girls have no access to clean and safe sanitary products, or to a clean and private space in which she can change menstrual cloths or pads and wash them. Menstruation is supposed to be invisible and silent, and sometimes, women and girls are supposed to be invisible and silent, too. Many girls and women are subject to restrictions in their daily lives simply because they are menstruating. Besides the health problems due to poor hygiene during menstruation, the lack of facilities and appropriate sanitary products may push menstruating girls temporarily or sometimes permanently out of school, having a negative impact on their right to education. Cleanliness is not maintained at toilets of many schools. Attendance at school is still a main problem because there is no proper place to change cloths at school. Most of the girls return home during the day if they need to change their cloths, which means they miss at least one hour of school. Parents, social workers and the authorities of the educational institutions should come forward so that the girls get proper atmosphere for hygiene management while staying at educational institutions. Menstruation health management in Bangladesh is awfully alarming as 80 per cent of girls are accustomed to using old pieces of cloths during menstruation, according to a study published last year. About 40 per cent of girls do not go to school for three days on an average during their menstrual period and they reuse the old pieces of cloth without washing those in hygienic manner or drying those properly, said the report. The report, prepared by assessing the health manners of students, stressed on menstrual health of girls at the national level. The Policy Support Unit of Local Government Division has conducted The Baseline Survey on National Hygiene in association with ICDDR,B. In some instances, women are forced to observe dietary restrictions. There are still taboos over the issue. It is thought that certain foods should be avoided by the girls and the women during their period. There is widespread belief that menstrual blood is polluted and dangerous and that the menstruating body is weak and shameful, leads to behaviour that exposes women to health risks. Poor hygiene leads to increased health problems. Poor menstrual hygiene is linked to lower reproductive tract infections, urinary tract infections and others, indicating higher anaemia and infertility, said Dr Nowsheen Sharmin Purabi, a teacher of Gynecology department of Anwer Khan Modern Medical College in the capital. Education on sexuality, reproductive health and other related issues are needed and this should be included in the textbooks. Our teachers and educational institutions should be prepared to handle the issue, said Dr Purabi, adding that there should be special corner at the hospital for treating the related cases, because it will help the girls maintain privacy and better deal with the situation. Md Sazedul Islam is a journalist. Email: In Bangladesh, though many progresses have been achieved regarding womens rights, there are certain areas such as reproductive health where they are being deprived of their rights mainly due to the societys outlook. There are many teenage girls who fell to trouble because of lack of knowledge on reproductive issue. If they were aware, they could avoid undesirable situation. But the reality is different, resulting in sufferings for them. The teenage girls cannot share reproductive-related matters with their parents, hence the problem gets complicated. Awareness is very essential for dealing with the situation. According to UNICEF Bangladesh, there are 27.7 million adolescents aged 10-19 years in Bangladesh---13.7 million girls and 14 million boys---making up about one fifth of the totalpopulation.Most of the adolescents are not aware of sex education; hence they suffer from many diseases such as HIV/AIDS and many other sexual problems.

HIV+ couple thrown out of locality,,,,,"HIV+ couple thrown out of locality Publish Date : 2014-09-07, Publish Time : 15:15, View Count : 21 KOLKATA: An HIV-positive couple, who had come to terms with their affliction and were preparing for a new life, were assaulted and thrown out their North 24-Parganas locality by relatives and neighbors on Saturday afternoon, reports Times of India. The battered couple went to police, who helped them return to their home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the taboo that still surrounds the disease. Fortunately, some neighbours have come forward to support them. The couple has a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. The husband, a small-time trader, is 35 years old and his wife 32. She was the first to be detected with HIV during a routine test during her pregnancy in 2006. Her husband was also asked to undergo the test and he, too, tested positive. After the initial shock, they took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counseling. They decided to keep their condition under the wraps when doctors told them that they could lead a normal life under medication and care. ""The doctor who is treating us advised us of the precautions to take to prevent transmission. We have a daughter who is not infected. We have to take precautions to prevent the disease from spreading to her. The doctor also told us to start saving for antiretroviral therapy,"" the wife told TOI. A few days ago, her husbands younger brother stumbled upon their secret. He lives in the same house with his wife and two children. As soon as he came to know that his brother and sister-in-law were HIV-positive, he made life miserable for them. According to the couple, he kept demanding that they leave the house because they were putting him and his family at risk. ""No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,"" she added. Outnumbered and getting no assistance from locals, the couple and their daughter went to the police and narrated their trauma. Officers immediately sent a team to escort them back to the locality. ""The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husbands brother. We have taken down their complaint. We will take strong action against the accused,"" said Barrackpore detective chief C Sudhakar. When a police contingent accompanied the couple back to their house, the accused were nowhere to be found. After ensuring that the couple was safely in their house, police left a stern message with locals not to bother them in the future. Police are looking for the mans brother and his associates involved in the attack. Sources say he has fled the area with his family.

""No matter what their health needs are, everyone requires health solutions that are available and accessible, free from discrimination and of good quality."" The right to health is enshrined in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. This includes the right of everyone to the prevention and treatment of ill health, to make decisions about ones own health and to be treated with respect and dignity. The campaign reminds people that the right to health is much more than access to quality health services and medicines, that it also depends on a range of important assurances including, adequate sanitation and housing, healthy working conditions, a clean environment and access to justice. If a persons right to health is compromised, they are often unable to effectively prevent disease and ill health, including HIV, or to gain access to treatment and care. The most marginalized people in society, including sex workers, people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, people in prisons and migrants, are often the least able to access their right to health; they are also the most vulnerable to HIV. Most of the Sustainable Development Goals are linked in some way to health. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030, will depend heavily on ensuring the right to health for all.

Change perception about AIDS patients: President,,,,,"Change perception about AIDS patients: President Published :Sunday, 13 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 13 President Abdul Hamid on Saturday underscored the need for changing the public perception and broadening the line of thinking about AIDS patients as many such victims are being neglected socially. ""AIDS is not a curse. Its a serious public health issue. But many people infected with AIDS are being neglected by society?its not deserving. We need to change the public perception and broaden our thinking process,"" he said. The President said this while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) organised by Health and Family Welfare Ministry, Bangladesh and Partners in Population and Development (PPD) at International Convention City, Bashundhara. ICAAP has been playing a pivotal role in raising public awareness, building political commitment, strengthening advocacy networks and disseminating knowledge and experiences on HIV issues among stakeholders in the region since its first congress in 1990. President Hamid said, ""We need further attention to find out HIV patients who are living in disguise because they seem to become a serious threat since they may spread HIV among more people."" It is time for the removal of discrimination, stigmatisation and ostracizing then people living with HIV/AIDS, observed Hamid adding that the plight of AIDS widows, AIDS orphans or for that matter children and spouses of people living with AIDS is very challenging. ""Theyre marginalised to the brims of society. It is appalling to see that it is happening in an age which boasts of pushing the boundaries of science and technology to newer levels. Inter planetary travel seems easy, but looking inwards into our own selves is tough,"" the President noted. About Bangladesh, President Hamid said the country has realised the importance of community resilience as a key factor in combating HIV/AIDS epidemic very early. ""Weve made a significant progress in mitigating the spread of HIV but theres no place for complacency. No society can be safe till all its members follow the simple rules that are essentially knowledge-based and behaviour-driven,"" Hamid added. Observing that Bangladesh is not a high-risk country if go by statistics, he said but considering the complexity of viral transmission, Bangladesh has accorded the highest priority to containing HIV transmission in the country as many of Bangladeshi young people are setting sail for overseas jobs around the globe every year. ""Therefore, we cannot allow any Bangladeshi citizen to fall victim to HIV. Not only for Bangladeshi, but also for the entire humanity we dont want to leave anyone behind. Everyone should count,"" the President insisted. Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammed Nasim, State Minister Zahid Maleque, Health and Family Welfare Secretary Sayed Monjurul Islam and Executive Director of PPD and Secretary-General of ICAAP Joe Thomas spoke on the occasion. Nearly a thousand representatives from 56 countries are taking part in the three-day conference. ?UNB",{},"['patients', 'public', 'hiv', 'change', 'aids', 'need', 'bangladesh', 'welfare', 'perception', 'hamid', 'president']","Change perception about AIDS patients: President Published :Sunday, 13 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 13President Abdul Hamid on Saturday underscored the need for changing the public perception and broadening the line of thinking about AIDS patients as many such victims are being neglected socially.

Crackdown on sex trade in China’s Dongguan,,,,,"Crackdown on sex trade in China’s Dongguan Publish Date : 2014-02-11, Publish Time : 21:08, View Count : 1 HONG KONG, Feb 10 : Chinese authorities have carried out a rare crackdown on the sex trade in the ""sin city"" of Dongguan following a candid report by the state broadcaster on the underground industry, reports Reuters. China outlawed prostitution after the Communist revolution in 1949, but it returned with a vengeance following landmark economic reforms three decades ago, and has helped fuel a rise in HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. While the government carries out periodic crackdowns, it is unusual for state media to cover them in such a high-profile way or for top officials to comment on the problem, underscoring worry about the explosion of the sex trade. Media said 67 people were arrested and 12 venues were shut down in a sting operation involving thousands of police in the Dongguan region at the heart of Chinas Pearl River Delta industrial hub in the southern province of Guangdong. Provincial Communist party boss Hu Chunhua, stressed the need ""to conduct an extensive trawling-style crackdown on the entire city"", according to a report in the Nanfang Daily. Two city police chiefs had been suspended, Hong Kongs South China Morning Post reported. Chinas main state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), aired a half-hour report on Sunday chronicling what appeared to be extensive and open prostitution in five towns across Dongguan. Secretly shot footage showed scantily clad women parading on a stage and managers of venues speaking openly about prostitution services. The CCTV report was widely watched across China and followed with interest and widely commented on social media. While periodic sweeps against vice have been carried out, including during sensitive periods such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, the industry has thrived. Law enforcement often appears to be lax. The Dongguan region has long been known as a hub for the sex industry. Authorities there said last month the city had seen a high incidence of HIV/AIDS amid rumors that more than 2,700 sex workers had been infected, according to the Global Times, a Chinese tabloid owned by the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the Peoples Daily.

'Game changer' tuberculosis drug cures 9 in 10,"A new treatment for a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis can cure more than 90 percent of sufferers, according to a trial hailed Monday as a",,2018-10-23,The Daily Observer,"A new treatment for a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis can cure more than 90 percent of sufferers, according to a trial hailed Monday as a ""game changer"" in the fight against the global killer. Doctors in Belarus -- a country with one of the highest rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the world -- spent months treating patients with a new drug, bedaquiline, alongside other antibiotics. The results, seen exclusively by AFP, were startling: Of the 181 patients given the new drug, 168 were totally cured. The World Health Organization says currently only 55 percent of people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are successfully treated. The Belarus trial success rate -- 93 percent -- was largely replicated in bedaquiline trials in other countries in eastern Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia, according to abstracts seen by AFP, due to be unveiled at a major tuberculosis conference later this week. ""The results from this study confirm... that newer drugs like bedaquiline can cure and are game changers for people living with multidrug-resistant and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis,"" Paula Fujiwara, scientific director of The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease who was not involved in the research, told AFP. Lead researcher Alena Skrahina, from the Republican Research and Practical Centre for Pulmonology and TB in Minsk, called the bedaquiline results ""promising"". ""Generally, our study confirms the effectiveness of bedaquiline in previous clinical trials, and does not confirm the concerns about safety problems,"" she told AFP. Tuberculosis killed at least 1.7 million people in 2017, according to the WHO, making the airborne infection the worlds deadliest infectious disease. It kills more than three times as many people as malaria every year and is responsible for the majority of HIV/AIDS deaths. Despite the huge death toll, tuberculosis receives roughly a tenth of the global research funding that goes to HIV/AIDS. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is immune to two of the most common antibacterial drugs used to treat the disease. Experts believe it is spreading worldwide due to poor handling of tuberculosis cases. Unlike other global killers such as HIV, tuberculosis is curable -- but currently only under a strict six-month supervised regimen involving multiple daily drug doses. In many parts of the world medications are incorrectly stored, or simply run out before the treatment has finished, leading to greater drug resistance, especially in crowded settings such as prison and hospitals. The WHO says variants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have been reported in at least 117 countries around the world. - $13 billion pledge - Unlike many antibiotics, bedaquiline doesnt attack the bacteria directly and instead targets the enzymes that the disease relies on for its energy. All of the patients in the study experienced side effects but these were less severe than previously thought. Last month UN member states agreed a global plan to fight tuberculosis and to facilitate cheaper access to vital drugs. On the sidelines of the General Assembly in New York, world leaders pledged $13 billion annually to end the tuberculosis epidemic, with a further $2 billion to fund research -- up from $700 million currently. Unlike the battle against HIV, which has received high-profile celebrity backing, tuberculosis is often seen as a historic affliction effecting only remote and undeveloped parts of the world. Scientists and policymakers gather this week in The Hague for a global conference on lung health, where they are expected to warn that tuberculosis could spread through richer nations currently struggling with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and obesity. India alone accounts for a quarter of all tuberculosis cases, and there are hopes that new, cheaper drugs could help strangle the spread of the disease if rolled out worldwide. ""We urgently need more affordable drugs like bedaquiline if we are to seriously make a dent in curing the estimated 600,000 people falling sick to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis each year and avoiding nearly a quarter of a million deaths,"" said Fujiwara.

BD still has areas of MDGs to focus on: Report,,,,,"BD still has areas of MDGs to focus on: Report Observer Online Desk Published :Wednesday, 16 September, 2015, Time : 10:16 PM View Count : 8 Although Bangladesh has already met several targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), there are still areas that need greater attention including hunger-poverty reduction, employment generation and ensuring quality education at all levels. This was revealed at the ‘Millennium Development Goals: Bangladesh Progress Report-2015’ published today at a function held at a city hotel. General Economics Division (GED) of the Planning Commission organised the function. Finance Minister AMA Muhith and Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali spoke at the programme held with Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal in the chair. General Economics Division (GED) member of the Planning Commission Prof Dr Shamsul Alam made a power-point presentation on the salient features of the MDGs Progress Report 2015. The report showed that the MDG targets that Bangladesh has achieved include reducing headcount poverty and poverty gap ratio, reducing the prevalence of underweight children, attaining gender parity at primary and secondary education, under-five mortality rate reduction, containing HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs, under-five children sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets, detection and TB cure rate under DOTS and others. Besides, Bangladesh has made a remarkable progress in increasing enrolment at primary schools, lowering the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio, improving immunisation coverage and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases. The MDG progress report 2015 also said the areas in need of greater attention are increases in primary school completion and adult literacy rates, creation of decent wage employment for women, increase in the presence of skilled health professionals at delivery, increase in correct and comprehensive knowledge on HIV/AIDS, increase in forest coverage and coverage of ICT. Speaking on the occasion, Muhith said some of the countries have almost fully succeeded in the achieving the goals and targets of the MDGs like Bangladesh, while some of them are yet to do that but they never gave up. He said for the whole of the world it would take near about 15 years to eradicate poverty by 2030, but for Bangladesh eradication of poverty is a matter of four years. The Finance Minister said South-South cooperation, which has been a very important consideration for Bangladesh and some other countries, has made good advance. “We hope from this advancement made in the last 15 years, we shall continue to move forward over the next 15 years, which is called the SDGs.” Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal said Bangladesh has done a splendid job in a number of areas over the attainments of the MDGs, while the country’s growth is meaningful and is a balanced growth. “The MDGs are the beginning of the next bigger milestone that the world has to be completely free from hunger before 2030,” he said hoping that Bangladesh will be completely free from hunger by 2028 based on the annual decline of population at a rate of 1.74 percent. In line with the Millennium Declaration, a framework of 8 goals, 18 targets and 48 indicators were set to measure progress towards the MDGs over the period from 1990 to 2015. However, from January 2008, 21 targets were reset and 60 indicators have been used to monitor the MDGs progress. The eight MDGs were poverty and hunger, primary education, empower women, child mortality, maternal health, HIV/AIDS and other diseases, environmental sustainability and partnership for development. Regarding ‘Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger’ the report said Bangladesh has made commendable progress in respect of eradication of poverty and hunger. It has sustained a GDP growth rate of 6 plus percent in recent years that has played a positive role in eradicating poverty. The robust growth has been accompanied by corresponding improvements in several social indicators such as increased life expectancy (70.4 in 2013) and lower fertility rate (2.3 in 2014) despite having one of the worlds highest population densities. Towards achieving universal primary education, significant progress has been made in increasing equitable access in education (NER: 97.7 percent), reduction of drop outs, improvements in completion of the cycle, and implementation of a number of quality enhancement measures in primary education. Bangladesh has already achieved gender parity in primary and secondary enrolment. About gender equality and empowerment of women, the report said Bangladesh has already achieved the targets of gender parity in primary and secondary education at the national level. In 2015, Bangladesh was awarded the prestigious Women in Parliaments Global Forum award, known as WIP award, for its outstanding success in closing the gender gap in the political sphere. Bangladesh ranks 10th out of 142 countries. Bangladesh is on track for meeting the target that’s measured on three different parameters such as under-five mortality rate, infant mortality rate and immunization against measles. In reducing child mortality, the report said the under-five mortality rate was 151 per 1000 live births in 1990, which has come down to 41 per 1000 live births in 2013 and hence achieved the MDG target before the stipulated time. Likewise, the infant mortality rate was 94 per 1000 live births in 1990, which has reduced to 32 per 1000 live births in 2013; hence on the verge of achieving the target. Towards ensuring environmental sustainability, the report said at present there is only 13.40 percent of land in Bangladesh having tree cover with density of 30 percent and above and the area having tree cover is much lower than the target set for 2015 (20 percent). However, access to safe water for all is a challenge, as arsenic and salinity intrusion as a consequence of climate change will exacerbate the availability of safe water, especially for the poor. State Minister for Finance and Planning MA Mannan, Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Atiur Rahman, UNDP country director Pauline Tamesis spoke while GED Division Chief Naquib Bin Mahbub gave the address of welcome.

UN summit on TB seeks to put spotlight on killer disease,"UNITED NATIONS, Aug 25: It's the world's number one killer among infectious diseases, but tuberculosis has been eclipsed by HIV/AIDS as a focus of global attention and donor funding.When world leaders gather at the United Nations next month, they will be asked to change that by committing to end the tuberculosis pandemic by 2030 and come up with $13 billion annually to achieve that goal.A row between the United States and South Africa threatens, however, to cast a pall over the first high-level meeting on tuberculosis, to be held on the sidelines of the General Assembly meeting in New York.Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates whose global fund has done game-changing work to boost public health in poor countries will be among the headliners of the TB summit on September 26.",,2018-08-27,The Daily Observer,"UNITED NATIONS, Aug 25: Its the worlds number one killer among infectious diseases, but tuberculosis has been eclipsed by HIV/AIDS as a focus of global attention and donor funding. When world leaders gather at the United Nations next month, they will be asked to change that by committing to end the tuberculosis pandemic by 2030 and come up with $13 billion annually to achieve that goal. A row between the United States and South Africa threatens, however, to cast a pall over the first high-level meeting on tuberculosis, to be held on the sidelines of the General Assembly meeting in New York. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates whose global fund has done game-changing work to boost public health in poor countries will be among the headliners of the TB summit on September 26. ""TB is not a disease of the past, but if the world works together to fight it, I have no doubt it can be,"" Gates said in post on Twitter. Two months of negotiations on a final declaration were scheduled to wrap up in July, but the talks have dragged on after South Africa opposed US proposals to delete language that recognizes the right of poorer countries to access cheaper medicines. Medical charity MSF has applauded South Africas stance and urged countries to resist what it has described as ""an aggressive push"" by the US pharmaceutical lobby to restrict access to low-cost drugs. Diplomats said negotiations were continuing on a possible compromise. Last year, the World Health Organization sounded the alarm when it said tuberculosis had surpassed HIV/AIDS as the worlds number one infectious killer and was the ninth cause of death worldwide. About 1.7 million people died from TB in 2016 out of 10.4 million worldwide who became ill from the severe lung infection, according to the WHO. Will leaders turn up ? A 30-point final declaration under negotiation would commit governments to end the global tuberculosis epidemic by 2030 by stepping up investment and innovation to fight the disease. Governments would agree to mobilize at least $13 billion a year by 2022 for treatment and care and an additional $2 billion to fund research at a time when tuberculosis is becoming more resistant to antibiotics. Five countries are the hardest-hit by the TB pandemic: India, which accounts for a quarter of cases, Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan, but it remains unclear whether these nations are sending high-level officials to the summit. Non-governmental organizations say leaders from key donor countries like the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Canada must turn up for the meeting to be ground-breaking. -AFP",{},"['global', 'killer', 'countries', 'south', 'spotlight', 'tb', 'disease', 'seeks', 'united', 'meeting', 'leaders', 'summit', 'world', 'tuberculosis', 'nations']","UNITED NATIONS, Aug 25: It's the world's number one killer among infectious diseases, but tuberculosis has been eclipsed by HIV/AIDS as a focus of global attention and donor funding.

Culture dies where poverty survives,,,,,"Culture dies where poverty survives Vision 2021 to cure HIV - hunger, ignorance and vice Publish Date : 2014-07-04, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 75 The quote of Confucius is a must to be stated here before getting into the topic - ""In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of."" Poverty, the central villain of all progress, unless killed, will make the state rotten one day as culture cannot be practised where hunger cannot be fulfilled. And if culture dies, enlightenment will be graven too. To prevent this time travel towards the Dark Age, Vision 2021 has been planned. Poverty handcuffs the pathways of progress. The spectacular sarcasm that poverty does is that it snatches nothing from us but bestows malnourishment and ignorance. Consequently, these two gifts generate another sub-gift which is - crime. If these HIV (hunger, ignorance and vice) become pillars of a society, then undeniably the nation can easily tap the top of mischief and will stand first in the list of corruption. So having a Swiss account in a badly governed state is not something to be proud of at all. Culture practising, considered as a solution to erase all vices and a step towards enlightenment, will die unless the speed of poverty is caged with a punctuation of full-stop. And so, to mark the golden jubilee of Bangladeshs independence in 2021 and to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020, the present government Awami League (AL) planned Vision 2021 where we envision a Bangladesh which will be a middle income country and when poverty will be drastically made invisible. However, poverty makes a person leave his education to take hold of the family responsibilities. Thus, it creates child labour. Similarly, it hinders the improvement of a nation by creating copious uneducated mass. Even the crime rate of a state, in a good portion, depends on unemployment which is the product of starvation and lack of education. Filling the stomach is the first and foremost desire to survive. Malnutrition, which is the by-product of poverty, makes people die of hunger. So, a nation is surely to be collapsed if its first priority is not to eradicate poverty. Without removing these shackles and bonds no state can make a step towards development; without removing these girdles and garters, a society can hardly even dream of breathing the fresh breeze of liberation. So ALs attempt to execute Vision 2021 is laudable as no other political party at least proposed such concrete plans whereas AL at least has done so, let alone whether it would be properly executed or not. Otherwise, cultural revolution is not possible and without practising culture, terrorism, extremism or racism can never be erased from the states dairy. The irony of fate is that these chains are formed by us and these chains are paralysing the fate of the nation every now and then. Its a great matter of grief that a great number of children are engaged in physical work. The attendance of child labour is mounting by leaps and bounds day by day. To fill the stomach, children in our country toil in factories, paddy fields, workshops, markets and so on. To unwrap themselves from the grasp of poverty, they are even engaged in hazardous and perilous works in tanneries, garment factories, motor workshops, ship industries and what not. As a result, most of them come across deadly diseases or become paralysed or handicapped, or face premature deaths. Consequently, its a huge impediment towards education. The economic cause is the major one which binds them to work for survival. Since childhood, they have not made aware at all with their own culture and are never informed the ways how to nurture culture, ethics, consciousness, the sense of right and wrong, the sense to serve the state and the humankind. But hopefully, after 2021, a massive change is promised to be done and so all the awaiting eyes are kept on the calendar. Depending on the usage of something, it is considered a blessing or a curse. Same goes for the 8th largest over populated nation, Bangladesh. The ever growing population would not be a burden if it can be utilised properly. If the country breeds educated and high qualified children then it would be for sure a blessing but if it delivers dust then it would eventually make the land nothing but a desert. Vision 2021 seems promising for the state. If it can be implemented then vices are surely to be graven. Vision 2021 says gross domestic product will be raised to 8% by 2013 and 10% by 2021 which will be sustained thereafter with a view to providing food, clothing, shelter, education and health care to the citizens in accordance with Article 15 of the Constitution. In addition, population in 2021 is estimated 165 million, and labour force 105 million. Programmes would be taken up for employment of at least 85% of the work force. Keeping pace with the UNs Millennium Goals, Vision 2021 plans to reduce poverty to 15% from 45% now. Even it will enable us to meet the nutrition needs of 85% of the population, it says. To pluck out all these thorns is not a piece of cake. Without plucking them out, culture will surely die and demons inside us will only prevail. Vision 2021 is anticipated to be that pruner to pluck out these thorns of the state.r The writer is Sub-editor of The Daily Observer and can be reached at The quote of Confucius is a must to be stated here before getting into the topic - ""In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of.

The spectacular sarcasm that poverty does is that it snatches nothing from us but bestows malnourishment and ignorance. Consequently, these two gifts generate another sub-gift which is - crime. If these HIV (hunger, ignorance and vice) become pillars of a society, then undeniably the nation can easily tap the top of mischief and will stand first in the list of corruption. So having a Swiss account in a badly governed state is not something to be proud of at all. Culture practising, considered as a solution to erase all vices and a step towards enlightenment, will die unless the speed of poverty is caged with a punctuation of full-stop. And so, to mark the golden jubilee of Bangladeshs independence in 2021 and to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020, the present government Awami League (AL) planned Vision 2021 where we envision a Bangladesh which will be a middle income country and when poverty will be drastically made invisible.However, poverty makes a person leave his education to take hold of the family responsibilities. Thus, it creates child labour. Similarly, it hinders the improvement of a nation by creating copious uneducated mass. Even the crime rate of a state, in a good portion, depends on unemployment which is the product of starvation and lack of education. Filling the stomach is the first and foremost desire to survive. Malnutrition, which is the by-product of poverty, makes people die of hunger. So, a nation is surely to be collapsed if its first priority is not to eradicate poverty. Without removing these shackles and bonds no state can make a step towards development; without removing these girdles and garters, a society can hardly even dream of breathing the fresh breeze of liberation. So ALs attempt to execute Vision 2021 is laudable as no other political party at least proposed such concrete plans whereas AL at least has done so, let alone whether it would be properly executed or not. Otherwise, cultural revolution is not possible and without practising culture, terrorism, extremism or racism can never be erased from the states dairy. The irony of fate is that these chains are formed by us and these chains are paralysing the fate of the nation every now and then.Its a great matter of grief that a great number of children are engaged in physical work. The attendance of child labour is mounting by leaps and bounds day by day. To fill the stomach, children in our country toil in factories, paddy fields, workshops, markets and so on. To unwrap themselves from the grasp of poverty, they are even engaged in hazardous and perilous works in tanneries, garment factories, motor workshops, ship industries and what not.As a result, most of them come across deadly diseases or become paralysed or handicapped, or face premature deaths. Consequently, its a huge impediment towards education. The economic cause is the major one which binds them to work for survival. Since childhood, they have not made aware at all with their own culture and are never informed the ways how to nurture culture, ethics, consciousness, the sense of right and wrong, the sense to serve the state and the humankind. But hopefully, after 2021, a massive change is promised to be done and so all the awaiting eyes are kept on the calendar.Depending on the usage of something, it is considered a blessing or a curse. Same goes for the 8th largest over populated nation, Bangladesh. The ever growing population would not be a burden if it can be utilised properly. If the country breeds educated and high qualified children then it would be for sure a blessing but if it delivers dust then it would eventually make the land nothing but a desert.Vision 2021 seems promising for the state. If it can be implemented then vices are surely to be graven. Vision 2021 says gross domestic product will be raised to 8% by 2013 and 10% by 2021 which will be sustained thereafter with a view to providing food, clothing, shelter, education and health care to the citizens in accordance with Article 15 of the Constitution. In addition, population in 2021 is estimated 165 million, and labour force 105 million. Programmes would be taken up for employment of at least 85% of the work force. Keeping pace with the UNs Millennium Goals, Vision 2021 plans to reduce poverty to 15% from 45% now. Even it will enable us to meet the nutrition needs of 85% of the population, it says.To pluck out all these thorns is not a piece of cake. Without plucking them out, culture will surely die and demons inside us will only prevail. Vision 2021 is anticipated to be that pruner to pluck out these thorns of the state.rThe writer is Sub-editor of The Daily Observer and can be reached at [email protected]",{},"['survives', '2021', 'education', 'work', 'culture', 'country', 'poverty', 'state', 'dies', 'nation', 'vision', 'hunger']","Culture dies where poverty survives Vision 2021 to cure HIV - hunger, ignorance and vice Publish Date : 2014-07-04, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 75 The quote of Confucius is a must to be stated here before getting into the topic - ""In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of.

Sexual violence: A serious public health problem,"Sexual violence is defined as: any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting, including but not limited to home and work. Coercion can cover a whole spectrum of degrees of force. â€œThere are varieties of reasons why male rape is under-reported, including shame, guilt and fear of not being believed or of being denounced for what has occurred. Myths and strong prejudices surrounding male sexuality also prevent men from coming forward.â€Apart from physical force, it may involve psychological intimidation, blackmail or other threats -- for instance, the threat of physical harm, of being dismissed from a job or of not obtaining a job that is sought. It may also occur when the person aggressed is unable to give consent -- for instance, while drunk, drugged, asleep or mentally incapable of understanding the situation. Sexual violence includes rape, defined as physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration -- even if slight -- of the vulva or anus, using a penis, other body parts or an object. The attempt to do so is known as attempted rape. Rape of a person by two or more perpetrators is known as gang rape. Sexual violence can include other forms of assault involving a sexual organ, including coerced contact between the mouth and penis, vulva or anus.A wide range of sexually violent acts can take place in different circumstances and settings. These include, for example: rape within marriage or dating relationships; rape by strangers; systematic rape during armed conflict; unwanted sexual advances or sexual harassment, including demanding sex in return for favours; sexual abuse of mentally or physically disabled people; sexual abuse of children; forced marriage or cohabitation, including the marriage of children; denial of the right to use contraception or to adopt other measures to protect against sexually transmitted diseases; forced abortion; violent acts against the sexual integrity of women, including female genital mutilation and obligatory inspections for virginity; forced prostitution and trafficking of people for the purpose of sexual exploitation.There is no universally accepted definition of trafficking for sexual exploitation. The term encompasses the organized movement of people, usually women, between countries and within countries for sex work. Such trafficking also includes coercing a migrant into a sexual act as a condition of allowing or arranging the migration. Sexual trafficking uses physical coercion, deception and bondage incurred through forced debt. Trafficked women and children, for instance, are often promised work in the domestic or service industry, but instead are usually taken to brothels where their passports and other identification papers are confiscated. They may be beaten or locked up and promised their freedom only after earning -- through prostitution -- their purchase price, as well as their travel and visa costs.Studies from both industrialized and developing countries reveal that forced first intercourse is not rare. Unfortunately, there are few reliable statistics on the number of boys and men raped in settings such as schools, prisons and refugee camps. Most experts believe that official statistics vastly under-represent the number of male rape victims. The evidence available suggests that males may be even less likely than female victims to report an assault to the authorities. There are varieties of reasons why male rape is under-reported, including shame, guilt and fear of not being believed or of being denounced for what has occurred. Myths and strong prejudices surrounding male sexuality also prevent men from coming forward.As is the case with female victims of sexual assault, research suggests that male victims are likely to suffer from a range of psychological consequences, both in the immediate period after the assault and over the longer term. These include guilt, anger, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction, somatic complaints, sleep disturbances, withdrawal from relationships and attempted suicide. In addition to these reactions, studies of adolescent males have also found an association between suffering rape and substance abuse, violent behaviour, stealing and absenteeism from school.Among the various ways of reducing the incidence of both sexual violence and HIV infection, education is perhaps the foremost. For young people, above all, there must be comprehensive interventions in schools and other educational institutes, youth groups and workplaces. School curricula should cover relevant aspects of sexual and reproductive health, relationships and violence. They should also teach life skills, including how to avoid risky or threatening situations -- related to such things as violence, sex or drugs -- and how to negotiate safe sexual behaviour. For the adult population in general there should be full and accessible information on sexual health and the consequences of specific sexual practices, as well as interventions to change harmful patterns of behaviour and social norms that hinder communication on sexual matters. It is important that health care workers and other service providers receive integrated training on gender and reproductive health, including gender-based violence and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV infection. For rape victims, there should be screening and referral for HIV infection. Also, the use of post exposure prophylaxis for HIV --- given soon after the assault, together with counselling --- may be considered. Similarly, women with HIV should be screened for a possible history of sexual violence. Voluntary counselling programmes for HIV should consider incorporating violence prevention strategies.Sexual violence is a common and serious public health problem affecting millions of people each year throughout the world. It is driven by many factors operating in a range of social, cultural and economic contexts. At the heart of sexual violence directed against women is gender inequality. In many countries, data on most aspects of sexual violence are lacking, and there is a great need everywhere for research on all aspects of sexual violence. Of equal importance are interventions. These are of various types, but the essential ones concern the primary prevention of sexual violence, targeting both women and men, interventions supporting the victims of sexual assault, measures to make it more likely that perpetrators of rape will be caught and punished, and strategies for changing social norms and raising the status of women. It is vital to develop interventions for resource-poor settings and rigorously to evaluate programmes in both industrialized and developing countries. Health professionals have a large role to play in supporting the victims of sexual assault -- medically and psychologically -- and collecting evidence to assist prosecutions. The health sector is considerably more effective in countries where there are protocols and guidelines for managing cases and collecting evidence, where staffs are well-trained and where there is good collaboration with the judicial system. Ultimately, the strong commitment and involvement of governments and civil society, along with a coordinated response across a range of sectors, are required to end sexual violence.Mahruba Khanam, Project Coordinator, Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh (CIPR, B)",,2017-08-06,The Daily Observer,"Sexual violence: A serious public health problem â€œThere are varieties of reasons why male rape is under-reported, including shame, guilt and fear of not being believed or of being denounced for what has occurred.

SANDHANI arranged blood and eye donation campaign,November 2 is celebrated as,,2017-11-17,The Daily Observer,"SANDHANI arranged blood and eye donation campaign The chief guest of the programme was Mohammad Nasim, Health Minister of Bangladesh. The honourable guests included Shirajul Haque Khan, Habibur Rahman Khan, Kamrul Hasan Khan, Dipu Moni, Zahid Malek, Abul Kalam Azad and Habib Millat. The programme was arranged for all the volunteers and members of SANDHANI. Members all over Bangladesh attended the programme. Not only in Dhaka, on this day SANDHANI arranged programmes in different medical colleges such as free medical camp, blood donation camp, and conference. Secretary of SANDHANI Central Committee, Probal quoted, ""SANDHANI has been working in the country since 1978. Every year, we arrange programme on November 2 to involve medical students in voluntary works in order to bring a positive change in society."" Chit-chats about blood donation Blood safety We must make sure it is safe for people to give blood and for patients to receive donated blood. Blood safety information is provided below: Screening Donors are examined for signs and symptoms of diseases that can be transmitted in a blood transfusion, such as HIV, malaria, syphilis, and viral hepatitis. Screening may include questions about risk factors for various diseases. Donor preparation The donor is also examined and asked specific questions about their medical history to make sure that donating blood is not hazardous to their health. The donors haemoglobin level is tested to make sure that the loss of blood will not make them anaemic. Pulse, blood pressure, and body temperature are also evaluated. The safety of donating blood during pregnancy has not been studied thoroughly, and pregnant women are usually deferred until six weeks after the pregnancy. Advantages of blood donation Generally, a human being has at least 5-6 litres of blood. During blood donation, we donate 250 -400 ml of blood which is only 10 per cent of total blood. Moreover, blood consists of water, which is replaceable within 24 hours. Blood donation allows bone marrows to produce new blood in body. RBC has a life span of 120 days. So, within 3 months RBC of blood break down and stimulates growth of new blood RBC. Blood donation is really a healthy process. Blood donation keeps your heart and liver healthy and prevents cardiac and hepatic diseases. During blood donation screening procedure is done which identifies whether a person has any of these diseases: Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, malaria, syphilis, HIV (AIDS). Blood donation helps to keep our cholesterol under control. Excessive amount of iron is called heamochromatosis. So, regular blood donation helps to prevent this. It also helps to keep your weight in control.

Ebola-hit Sierra Leone's Freetown a city on edge,,,,,"Ebola-hit Sierra Leones Freetown a city on edge No cure, no established drug therapy and no vaccine to protect victims Publish Date : 2014-08-13, Publish Time : 09:54, View Count : 41 FREETOWN: In the rain-lashed streets of Sierra Leones capital, emaciated mongrels pick fights with feral pigs for scraps of food, unnoticed by the market traders and office workers passing by. The 1.2 million inhabitants of Freetown were once wary of diseased street animals, but now it is each other that they fear. The sprawling tropical city, on the Atlantic coastline of one of the worlds poorest countries, is a days drive from the epicentre of the most deadly outbreak of the Ebola virus in history. ""We are all scared because of the way Ebola is spreading but we are taking all the necessary precautions,"" says Waisu Gassama, 27, who works in the HIV department of the dilapidated, century-old Connaught Hospital, Freetowns main adult medical centre. Gassama tells AFP the unit has stopped testing patients for HIV, such is the fear over the possibility that blood samples might contain Ebola. Outside the hospital, soldiers say they have been drafted in to guard doctors and nurses, many of whom have been targeted by angry mobs blaming modern medicine for exacerbating the epidemic. It is little wonder that Ebola can propagate panic quicker than it spreads death. The virus is classified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Protection as a category A bioterrorism agent, along with anthrax, botulism and smallpox. There is no cure, no established drug therapy and no vaccine to protect victims against the lethal haemorrhagic fever which the pathogen causes, breaking down vital organs until they seep out of the victims lungs, skin and eyes. Ebola has killed 1,013 people in the current outbreak, more than half of those it has infected, spreading from southern Guinea to Liberia, Sierra Leone and then Nigeria. - Everyone is afraid - Because the virus is so hazardous, it requires treatment and research facilities with the highest levels of containment and highly trained personnel -- resources which one of the worlds poorest regions does not have in abundance. The indigenous tribal villages of Sierra Leones densely forested eastern region bordering Liberia and Guinea have seen most of the countrys deaths. Less than 300 kilometres (180 miles) away, Freetown is a city on edge, if not outright panic. Buckets of chlorine solution stand at the entrance to shops, offices, churches -- every building, in fact, into which the public might venture. Eyes dart accusingly when someone coughs on public transport and hoteliers demand that every guest wash their hands before entering. Old friends, neighbours, brothers and sisters have stopped physical contact, awkwardly waving across an imagined buffer when they meet. ""We have not suffered badly yet, but everyone is afraid,"" said Olivette, a 38-year-old shopkeeper in the Cotton Tree area of the town centre who preferred not to give her surname. ""I make sure everyone washes before they come in and no one touches me or my children -- not even other family members."" Traumatised by a civil war that spanned the 1990s, Freetown has endured its share of privations. In a reminder of the horrors of a conflict which left 50,000 dead, crumbling, bomb-scarred buildings among the ironwood and palm trees remain a sobering testament to the countrys violent past. But Ebola -- a silent assassin which strikes with no warning, killing young and old, men and women, indiscriminately -- presents an altogether more insidious threat. In a city where the outbreak is the only topic of conversation, everyone has an angle. Fears of spread westwards Posters rallying the public to the ""fight against the scourge"" can be found on almost every street corner, usually promoting the particular cause of the author in the process. Beneath a revered ancient cotton tree near the supreme court, a banner bearing a crucifix and Islamic crescent calls attention to the ""Religious Leaders Task Force on Ebola"". Nearby, a poster informs passers-by that the Sweissy Jewellers Organization is calling on supporters to ""Join The Fight"", presumably by swapping their contaminated earrings and bracelets for the latest Ebola-free items. Sierra Leone, with its ill-equipped infrastructure and fragile health system, has borne the brunt of the outbreak, with 730 cases, significantly more than any of its neighbours. The nations sole virologist, who was at the forefront of its battle against the epidemic, died from Ebola last month. Eight Chinese medical workers and 24 nurses mostly from a military hospital have been placed in quarantine in Freetown this week, heightening fears that a wave of cases was about to sweep into the overcrowed. Meanwhile, flash flooding in the Ebola-hit eastern city of Kenema has exacerbated the crisis, with locals voicing fears that a cholera outbreak could add to their woes. The government says it has requested samples of an experimental Ebola drug, ZMapp, that has shown some positive effects on two US aid workers. Meanwhile President Ernest Bai Koroma expressed his ""utter dismay"" at the ""slow pace"" of the international community in responding to the outbreak on Monday. Back at the Connaught Hospital, Waisu Gassama summed up the fears of many but sounded a note of optimism as he left at the end of another shift. ""We are really worried about it spreading from the east,"" he said. ""But at least the government is doing well trying to contain the virus.""

MDGs and other national goals be achieved,,,,,"MDGs and other national goals be achieved Dr Anumahmud Publish Date : 2014-10-15, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 18 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): Bangladesh Progress Report?, released at a function in Dhaka, portrays a picture of half-empty or half-full glass. It can be likened to a mixed bag of satisfaction and disappointment, in terms of progress made in meeting the MDGs. These goals were adopted in September 2000 by the world leaders at the United Nations headquarters. The MDGs range from halving extreme poverty to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education, all by the target year of 2015. A review of the progress made in reaching the MDGs during the penultimate year of the deadline set by the UN is a must-do job. The UN itself has published a progress report that also speaks of mixed results. The poor developing countries would generally be successful in meeting some of the targets by the timeframe. But it would take some more time for them to reach a few important goals such as reducing the child and maternal mortality rates and boosting the number of children attending primary education. However, the UN in its report published in July last claimed that the MDGs had made profound difference to peoples lives in the poor developing regions of the world. Bangladesh, according to the government report, has also made some laudable progress in achieving a good number of MDGs including those of poverty reduction and child and maternal mortality rate. But it is unlikely to reach some of the other key targets within the UN-set deadline. Employment generation, gender equality, improvement of the nutritional status of the population and forest coverage are among the areas where progress has been rather unsatisfactory. The MDGs set eight goals under which there are 21 targets and 60 indicators with targets to measure the progress. According to the report, Bangladesh is, in general, on track in achieving partial success in areas like eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equity and empowering women, reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. The country, however, lagged behind in achieving three goals - combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development - which needed more attention. The current employment rate for the countrys population aged 15+ is 59.3 per cent. The country will not be able to achieve the target of ensuring employment for all by 2015, and the percentage of women in wage employment needs to be raised to 50 per cent by 2015 which is now only 19 per cent. Notwithstanding the fact that Bangladesh is being frequently cited as a role model in MDG achievement globally, its failure to make a satisfactory level of progress in meeting the targets concerning employment, primary education, adult literacy, women empowerment, nutritional and forest coverage will continue to hurt most the impoverished section of its population. There is no denying that the developed economies, particularly the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) countries have failed to keep their promises on making available at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national product (GNP) to the developing and least developed countries, including Bangladesh, as official development assistance (ODA) to help the latter achieve MDGs. The development assistance that Bangladesh has been receiving since the launching of the MDGs is not enough for achieving the targets. However, the failure to keep commitments on the part of the rich and developed countries on resource transfer is nothing new. It has happened time and again. But what remains more important is the prudent use of domestic as well as foreign funds through the right kind of projects and programmes that would directly or indirectly help achieve the MDGs. Wastage and misallocation of scarce resources in public sector programmes are quite common features in Bangladesh. Thus, there is an urgent need to make improvements in the utilization of public resources. More importantly, the government should ensure greater involvement of the private sector to supplement, not to supplant, its own initiatives that are purported to meeting MDGs and also other national development goals. According to the seventh MDG Bangladesh Progress Report, as quoted in the press, the country made progress in achieving some indicators of millennium development goals. The said report also mentioned that in other important targets including ensuring employment for all, increasing share of women in wage employment, adult literacy and completion of primary schooling, Bangladesh lagged behind. However, in the assessment of the Planning Ministry, it emerged that Bangladesh, still considered as a Least Developed Nation, has met some other Millennium Development Goals. What has most economists stumped is that Bangladesh will certainly not attain the targets by 2015 and there has been lack of promised international support for achieving such. Under these circumstances, developed nations must come forward with more private investment in Bangladesh, which would prove more effective in helping Bangladesh to achieve the goals. Seemingly, Bangladesh is on the right track in achieving the goals set, but lack of adequate infrastructure and assistance from developed countries poses a big hindrance to bridge the gap of unmet goals. It is high time the government, experts and industry insiders came together to ensure a better standing of Bangladesh in the global context by helping to lead the country in the right and effective direction. Ultimately such goals must be achieved by our own efforts. At the top of it, to attain a sustainable development level, there must be strong and honest political leadership with the will to deliver good governance free from corruption and vices of over-politicisation of the affairs of the state down to the ground level.r The writer is an economic analyst and a columnist.

Community development through tourism,,,,,"World Tourism Day on Sept 27 Community development through tourism Mohammad Shahidul Islam Publish Date : 2014-09-23, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 54 The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported in 2013 that the travel and tourism industry in Bangladesh directly generated 1,281,500 jobs in 2012 or 1.8 per cent of the countrys total employment, which ranked Bangladesh 157 out of 178 countries worldwide. Tourism in Bangladesh is a developing foreign currency earner. The country was listed by Lonely Planet in 2011 as the ""best value destination"". Contrary to this, World Bank says, Bangladesh, with about 160 million inhabitants on a landmass of 147,570 square kilometres, is among the most densely-populated countries in the world, while poverty in both urban and rural areas declined by an impressive 19 percentage points in the last decade-and-a-half, the absolute number of people below the poverty line remains significant. In the above backdrop, community development through tourism could be a great pillar for poverty alleviation in Bangladesh. Tourism has always been considered a blessing to the community since prehistoric times when primitive man started to move away from his usual habitat, often to great distances, in search of necessities such as food, shelter and clothing. In a word, tourism has stood beside the poor community. With the passage of eras, tourism has won over the world and the world in turn has won over tourism. In developing countries like Bangladesh, the contribution of tourism in alleviating poverty is enormous. Its incorporation in policy-making in countries such as Nepal and Bhutan has resulted in greater dividends with increasing GDP. The prospect of tourism is no more new in Bangladesh and yet it remains an embryonic means to lift the country on to a solvent status. Measures to reduce poverty can well be handled through tourism in Bangladesh. This year World Tourism Day theme goes celebrated on fostering Tourism and Community Development. Across the world there are many problems traced in the community like adolescent pregnancy, access to clean drinking water, child abuse and neglect, crime, domestic violence, drug use, environmental contamination, ethnic conflict, health disparities, HIV/AIDS, hunger, inadequate emergency services, inequality, jobs, lack of affordable housing, poverty, racism, transportation and violence. These problems hold the society back for further national development. Tourisms role has been considered to fight against the above problems. The theme of world tourism day 2014: ""Tourism and Community Development"", is a highlighter, ""brings to the forefront the potential that tourism has to promote new socio-economic opportunities and better livelihoods for communities around the world while highlighting the critical role that community engagement has in advancing sustainable development"" cited in the official message of UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai while The United Nations says Community development as ""a process where community members come together to take collective action and generate solutions to common problems."" The ability of the national economy to benefit from tourism depends on the availability of investment to develop the necessary infrastructure and on its ability to supply the needs of tourists. The book, Community Development through Tourism, authored by Sue Breeton, an associate professor at La Trobe University, Australia, is the Bible in this regard. This book examines the development of local communities through the healthy integration of community planning, business planning and finally tourism planning. It explores the most pertinent tourism and business theories, moving from strategic planning to community empowerment and practice. The book says, research-based case studies can illustrate how things work in the real world for community development. For the community development, all out affords from all stakeholders should come forward for common goals by chalking proper planning and implementation out. Whilst poverty alleviation remains a highly ambiguous, much debated concept, Sue Beeton proclaims that community development through tourism is the only responsible long-term solution for managing contemporary poverty in the third world. Bangladesh will need to recognise that the critical issue for tourism developers today is ensuring a net benefit tomorrow for the entire environment in which tourism takes place. Tourism has become an important sector that has an impact on development of country economy. The main benefits of tourism are income creation and generation of jobs. For many regions and countries it is the most important source of welfare. The concept and vista of tourism implemented community are still unnoticed in Bangladesh. Now is the right time to think of tourism implemented community development. Its benefits will act as a catalyst in the overall development in Bangladesh. Community tourism development will have the following outcomes: a Gross Domestic Product growth a Human resource development a Poverty alleviation a Originality in culture and heritage a Development of water tourism and eco-tourism a Development of rural livelihood a Education and training for all a Peace and happiness a Promotion of local cuisine a Women employment etc Communities across the world face enormous challenges as their social, economic, and environmental resources are being depleted and destroyed. Only sustainable development can pave a holistic way to achieve recovery and enhance the quality of life for everyone in these communities by developing local assets to revitalise economies, limiting waste and pollution, improving the status of disadvantaged people, conserving natural resources, and promoting cooperation and efficiency.

How to ensure every development dollar counts,"In 2017, $146 billion was spent on aid and development. Even this large sum remains a fraction of what would be needed to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, despite the scarce resources, there is surprisingly little discussion about setting priorities in development spending.In international polls and on the world stage, developing countries are very clear about their priorities: Improved health care and education, more and better jobs, less corruption, and solutions to nutritional challenges. Unfortunately, these areas are not necessarily where rich countries direct funds.In fact, if current trends hold, the world will fail to achieve the SDGs' targets for 2030 in a host of areas: Maternal mortality, tuberculosis, family planning access, HIV, non-communicable disease mortality, pre-primary and primary school access, stunting, wasting, undernourishment, violence against women, birth registration, water access, gender equality in public leadership, sanitation access, and air pollution.But, instead of allocating development funding to try to speed up progress in these areas, much of it is being directed elsewhere. To take the most glaring example: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that more than 20 percent of development aid is being spent on climate change-related projects and activities.Clearly, more could be achieved in health, education, and other areas if one-fifth of development spending did not go toward projects like rolling out inefficient solar",,2019-01-18,The Daily Observer,"In 2017, $146 billion was spent on aid and development.

To take the most glaring example: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that more than 20 percent of development aid is being spent on climate change-related projects and activities. Clearly, more could be achieved in health, education, and other areas if one-fifth of development spending did not go toward projects like rolling out inefficient solar ""microgrids,"" which tick a ""climate"" box for donors but do little to transform lives. Climate concerns rank last or near last among policy issues in global polls of developing countries. How could development funds be better used? Cost-benefit analysis can play a vital role in shining a light on interventions and investments that achieve the most for every dollar spent. The Copenhagen Consensus Center, the think tank that I lead, undertook a comprehensive study of the 169 SDG targets. It examined the entire menu of development options and added prices and detailed information about what each could achieve. This analysis revealed that, of the 169 targets, 19 represent the best value for money. Consider the often overlooked - and politically frowned-upon - development target of universal access to family planning, which the analysis showed would cost $3.6 billion annually. Ensuring that women have control over pregnancy would mean 150,000 fewer maternal deaths and 600,000 fewer orphaned children per year. It would also lead to a demographic dividend, boosting economic growth. The total benefits to society from every dollar spent would reach some $120. Similarly, investment in child nutrition pays lifelong dividends because a healthy diet enables better brain and muscle development. Well-nourished children stay in school longer, learn more and end up being much more productive members of society. The evidence suggests that providing better nutrition for 68 million children each year would produce more than $40 in long-term social benefits for every dollar spent. Or consider tuberculosis, the planets most deadly (and most overlooked) infectious disease. Tuberculosis hits the worlds poorest people and mostly affects young adults at an age when they have just become parents and economically active. Families lose incomes and children lose parents. Our analysis shows that investment in expanding tuberculosis testing and treatment delivers $43 of social benefits for each dollar spent. An expert panel of economists, including two Nobel laureates, found that every dollar spent on these and the rest of the 19 most effective global development targets would return $20-$40 in long-term social benefits. In contrast, allocating funds evenly across all 169 targets would yield benefits worth less than $10 per dollar spent. In other words, focusing first on taking the most effective actions would be the same as doubling or even quadrupling the aid budget. Cost-benefit analysis by the Copenhagen Consensus Center is now helping set national priorities in Bangladesh and Haiti, and at the state level in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh in India. In Bangladesh, the findings have supported the governments roll-out of more efficient and transparent e-procurement policies and more focused nutrition initiatives; in Haiti, they are underpinning the decision by the government and donors to fortify local flour with vital micronutrients to save young lives. The challenge is to expand this approach further. Cost-benefit analysis should not dictate how every aid and development dollar is spent. But the clock continues to tick toward 2030, and the world is behind schedule on many of its development targets. If we ignore economic efficiency, we risk failing to make the needed progress against humanitys greatest challenges.

Fundamental rights of transgender people need to be ensured,,,,,"Fundamental rights of transgender people need to be ensured Published :Saturday, 25 July, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 5 RAJSHAHI, July 24: Multi-sectoral approach should be adopted to ensure fundamental rights especially health, social and legal rights of the transgender people for uplifting their living condition and livelihood, human rights activists and professional leaders here said. They said the society, as a whole, should come forward with a positive attitude towards the socially excluded people for their coexistence in the society. Emphasis should be given on integrated efforts towards ensuring human rights and healthcare to the hizra community for substantial and sustainable reduction of their existing vulnerabilities. Advocate Shamsunnanar Mukti called for adopting need-oriented measures like proper treatment, free medicine, free condom, awareness program, separate hospital and test of blood in terms of reducing STDs/HIV/AIDS related risk and vulnerability. She articulated that their rights like human dignity, to work, equality and non-discrimination, freedom from all sorts of abuse and manipulation, equal access to education, security of person and property must be ensured. Chief Health Officer of Rajshahi City Corporation Dr FAM Anzuman Ara Begum mentioned that the members of transgender community are subjected to negligence and repression in every sphere of life including family and society. The Hijra community is essentially deprived of several rights under the countrys existing law, because it recognizes only two sexes, male and female. Time has come to promoting and protecting fundamental rights of the extreme socially excluded people. Dr Ashraf Siddikey, Associate Professor of Sex, Skin and Venereal Diseases of Rajshahi Medical College and Hospital (RMCH), said transgender is a hormonal disability like different other physical and mental disorders. But, most of the mainstream people have no idea about it. As a result, the transgender people are subjected to disparity in the society and also become stigmatized and victimized frequently. He, however, said ""Anal sex has ten times more risks of infection and spread of sexual transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS for both sex-workers and clients than that of vaginal ones"". Dr Siddikey said sex workers remain one of the high risk groups, with increasing rates of infections. Particularly, street sex workers are the most vulnerable groups for STDs. ?BSS",{},"['socially', 'ensured', 'subjected', 'workers', 'community', 'need', 'transgender', 'human', 'society', 'fundamental', 'sex', 'rights']","Fundamental rights of transgender people need to be ensured Published :Saturday, 25 July, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 5RAJSHAHI, July 24: Multi-sectoral approach should be adopted to ensure fundamental rights especially health, social and legal rights of the transgender people for uplifting their living condition and livelihood, human rights activists and professional leaders here said.

Deep-rooted homophobia,,,,,"Deep-rooted homophobia Owen Jones Publish Date : 2014-06-03, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 72 Who knew cleaning wipes had so many diverse uses? Removing spilt pasta sauce from dining tabletops; exterminating bacteria in kitchens; wiping away the gay. According to research released last week, straight people show the need to ""physically cleanse"" at the very thought of contact with gay men. ""Yuck"", was my initial reaction - sadly, a response reciprocated among many of the studys participants - but they do provide a fascinating insight into what makes homophobia tick. Let me explain what the researchers at Goldsmiths University found. In the first study, British students who were asked to imagine borrowing a phone from a gay man came up with significantly more words about cleansing in a word-completion task. In another study, Portuguese students were offered either a yellow pencil or yellow disinfecting wipe after the experiment; those who imagined borrowing a phone from a gay man were more likely to choose the wipe. And, finally, Polish students - again asked to imagine borrowing a phone from a gay man - expressed a preference for cleaning products. Seems pretty definitive: on a subconscious level, gay men are seen as a contaminant, something to be washed away. ""Ugh, Ive got gay on me!"", if you will. As a gay man, maybe I should be hurt, hesitant in future to offer my hand in greeting to another person in case I trigger a subconscious urge to reach for the anti-bacterial gel. But actually the findings intrigued me, because prejudice can only be washed away (if you will) when it is understood. One possible explanation is what you could call an HIV/Aids crisis hangover. HIV was, after all, once the ""gay plague"" (Aids was originally christened Grid - gay related immune deficiency); good old-fashioned homophobia fused with the dread of a frightening illness. From my experience, this isnt a phenomenon exclusive to straight people: some gay men admit that their own chronic fear of HIV is down to an internalised sense of shame. But actually, Agnieszka Golec de Zavala - one of the researchers - tells me this is one of the least interesting explanations. The most compelling theory is that this impulse to scrub off gayness has everything to do with group identity. Cleansing is about separating: it has ""a very social meaning"" as de Zavala puts it. If you have established a clear division with another group, that they are ""the other"", and you convince yourself that you have nothing in common with them, then any form of interaction becomes contamination. It makes sense: cleansing is often used as a metaphor to separate ourselves from groups we disapprove of. How many of us have joked ""I hope you had a bath afterwards!"" to a friend who has spent time with some perceived undesirables? In its most sinister form, cleansing has underpinned the rhetoric of racist totalitarian regimes: the Nazis were fixated with ""racial purity"" and Mussolini was obsessed with the colour white. ""Ethnic cleansing"" is the perverse euphemism for terrorising other ethnic groups. This entirely gels with a proper understanding of what homophobia is. Rather than a straightforward dislike or fear of gay people, homophobia is often about ""gender policing"": protecting the boundaries of what it is to be a man. Homophobia is not only directed at gays, after all: straight men suffer it, too. From an early age, those who dont conform to a certain type of masculinity - not being aggressive enough, not speaking about women in sufficiently degrading terms, not being athletic, and so on - risk being labelled a ""poof"". This has everything to do with sexism and misogyny. Both straight men who dont conform to type and gay men are seen as womanly, and being like a woman is considered degrading. The rather creepy research findings show that the more conservative the man, the stronger the impulse to wash away gay contact. Hardly surprising: more conservative men tend to have a stronger belief in gender difference, in protecting a more unreconstructed masculinity. Gay men are the ultimate menace to this identity, a threat to heterosexual solidarity: the contagion to be washed away. Thats why - without sounding complacent - homophobia is ultimately doomed. Being a man isnt a static concept. Before the 18th century, it was widely believed that men and women were part of the same sex, and that womens vaginas were actually penises tucked inside the body. The idea of a rigid division between the genders only became dominant in the 19th century: but, with the rise of the womens and LGBT movements, this division has been dramatically eroded. According to the Social Attitudes Survey, in 1987, nearly half of Britons agreed that ""a mans job is to earn money; a womans job is to look after the home and family""; but that has now toppled to around one in 10. The number of ""househusbands"" has trebled in 15 years (admit Who knew cleaning wipes had so many diverse uses?

It makes sense: cleansing is often used as a metaphor to separate ourselves from groups we disapprove of. How many of us have joked ""I hope you had a bath afterwards!"" to a friend who has spent time with some perceived undesirables? In its most sinister form, cleansing has underpinned the rhetoric of racist totalitarian regimes: the Nazis were fixated with ""racial purity"" and Mussolini was obsessed with the colour white. ""Ethnic cleansing"" is the perverse euphemism for terrorising other ethnic groups.This entirely gels with a proper understanding of what homophobia is. Rather than a straightforward dislike or fear of gay people, homophobia is often about ""gender policing"": protecting the boundaries of what it is to be a man. Homophobia is not only directed at gays, after all: straight men suffer it, too. From an early age, those who dont conform to a certain type of masculinity - not being aggressive enough, not speaking about women in sufficiently degrading terms, not being athletic, and so on - risk being labelled a ""poof"". This has everything to do with sexism and misogyny. Both straight men who dont conform to type and gay men are seen as womanly, and being like a woman is considered degrading.The rather creepy research findings show that the more conservative the man, the stronger the impulse to wash away gay contact. Hardly surprising: more conservative men tend to have a stronger belief in gender difference, in protecting a more unreconstructed masculinity. Gay men are the ultimate menace to this identity, a threat to heterosexual solidarity: the contagion to be washed away.Thats why - without sounding complacent - homophobia is ultimately doomed. Being a man isnt a static concept. Before the 18th century, it was widely believed that men and women were part of the same sex, and that womens vaginas were actually penises tucked inside the body.The idea of a rigid division between the genders only became dominant in the 19th century: but, with the rise of the womens and LGBT movements, this division has been dramatically eroded. According to the Social Attitudes Survey, in 1987, nearly half of Britons agreed that ""a mans job is to earn money; a womans job is to look after the home and family""; but that has now toppled to around one in 10. The number of ""househusbands"" has trebled in 15 years (admit",{},"['deeprooted', 'gay', 'man', 'straight', 'washed', 'homophobia', 'cleansing', 'phone', 'students', 'men', 'away']","Deep-rooted homophobia Owen Jones Publish Date : 2014-06-03, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 72 Who knew cleaning wipes had so many diverse uses?

Traditional values impede women's reproductive health care,,,,,"Exclusive Interview Traditional values impede womens reproductive health care Engendered Health chief Ulla Muller tells the Daily Observer Published :Saturday, 19 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 30 Ulla Muller, is the President and Chief Executive Officer of EngenderedHealth, a leading global womens health organisation. Very recently she came to Bangladesh and visited differnt parts of the country to know about present status of womens rights, especially, their reproductive health. During her visit she went to the remote rural villages of Bangladesh to meet with the patients suffering from fistula and other health ailments. Besides she also talked with the women who are satisfied with Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive and Permanent Method acceptors and cured obstetric fistula patients and visited family planning facilities in Jessore and Dhaka. She also met different government and UN officials to discuss the possible measures to combat this situation. Ms Muller has been a lifelong advocate for the rights of women and girls and is a thought leader in human rights, poverty alleviation, and womens sexual and reproductive health Her visit will provide more guidance to population and obstetric fistula programmes of Bangladesh. The Daily Observer on Sunday approached Ulla Muller to know about her observations about womens reproductive health and especially, Obstetric fistula as the disease is a common predicament for Bangladeshi women in rural areas. The Daily Observer: How do you review the reproductive health rights of women in Bangladesh? Ulla Muller: Womens reproductive health right is a significant phenomenon for upholding womens right. Without it establishing women rights is not possible. And when this right is not ensured, rather others decisions are imposed on women, then it is nothing but a modern form of slavery; their human rights are abused and violated. Women must have their right to choose their partner, how many children they will have, this is a human right. Bangladesh has got remarkeble progresss in many areas such as less maternity death but still there are a few areas where we need to work. According to a research report conducted by EngenderedHealth Bangladesh, at least two thousands women get affected with fistula every year. At the same time, two women are being affected with obstetric fistula in every one thousand married women. Observer: How could a women or girl could be free from such modern form of slavery? Ulla Muller: At first, they must know about their rights. Violation or abuse could occur due to lack of information and lack of education. For this reason, girls and women need to be educated. Having been well- equipped with education, they would have to be financially solvent and then take their own decisions. Only then, can we think of ensuring reproductive health standard and once a women has the reproductive right, then she will take the decisions -how many children she will give birth to. It will not come either from her husband or from her in -laws. Observer: Could you elaborate why this significant number of women folks is being caught by fistula? Ulla Muller: The trend of these diseases is being shown to the young mothers who get married at thier early age. If a girl get married at the age of 14-15 and become mother at this very early age, when they hardly know about pre-and- post-pregnancy care, which is very complicated, most of these mothers get caught by fistula. To prevent this, we need to raise a mass awareness in the rural areas where most young girls and mothers lack scopes to get access to reproductive health care. I think EngenderedHealth and other development organisations should work in partnership with government so that we can save the lives of young mothers just communicating with them and giving them necessary information. That will bring a great impact on their lives. Observer: You know this year Bangladesh has hosted the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia Pacific region. Could you share your views in regards of HIV/ AIDS in Bangladesh? Ulla Muller: Still Bangladesh has low risk in regards of HIV/ AIDs. But at the same time, lots of males are also going abroad to work. There sometimes they get sexually involved without taking any precautions. This is a high risk for his partner who stays at home. So continued awareness programme is needed to prevent it. And we should not forget that Bangaldesh also has a significant number of Injected drug userers, which also poses a serious threat of spreading HIV/ AIDS. Observer: To uphold womens rights including reproductive right for women in Bangladesh what are the big challenges? Ulla Muller: I think the existing traditional norms and values will be big challenges for Bangladesh to establishing womens rights. Even some superstitions lead women to shy away from achieving their rights. Male partners should realise and understand all things including present situation of women and their core problems due to lack of reproductive health right. And in this field government and development organisations need to work together extensively, only then can we expect a positive change in our society. Observer: Could you share about your organisations activities? Ulla Muller: EngenderHealth is a leading global womens health organisation with more than 70 years of experience in improving the quality of reproductive health, family planning, maternal health and HIV/ AIDS services. EngenderHealth is also committed to ensuring that every pregnancy is planned, every child is wanted, and every mother has the best chance of survival.

The theme of the four-day conference, to be held at Bangabandhu International Conference Center (BICC), is Be the Change Towards an AIDS Free Generation: Our Right to Health. The organisers have three goals for the conference that include to provide an international forum for communities and especially young peoples voices in the agenda setting for ending AIDS post 2015, according to UNAIDS. Two other goals are to promote increased responsibility and accountability for governments and the international community for ending AIDS and to provide a platform for country-by-country analysis of innovation, science and social determinants which will lead to the end of AIDS. This is the largest forum on AIDS held in the Asia and the Pacific region. Since the first ICAAP was held in 1990 - almost 25 years ago - the ICAAP has played a critical role in raising public awareness, building political commitment, strengthening advocacy networks and disseminating knowledge and experiences on HIV issues among stakeholders in the region. Meanwhile, UNAIDS Country Director Leo Kenny met Deputy Speaker Adv M Fazle Rabbi Mia at his Parliament office on Saturday and discussed the preparation of the conference, said a PID handout. The Deputy Speaker said he expects a positive outcome through the conference which will help build healthy generation in the world. Fazle Rabbi assured the UNAIDS Country Director about the adequate security measures for the foreign delegates during the conference in Dhaka.

Transition from MDG to SDG: Implications for healthcare systems,,,,,"Transition from MDG to SDG: Implications for healthcare systems Published :Wednesday, 23 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 28 Arian Hatefi, Neelam Sekhri, Haile Debas, Dean Jamison, Jaime Sepulveda, Alon Unger, and Richard GA Feachem In 2016, the world will move from a global commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to a focus on the much more ambitious and wide-ranging Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Whereas the health-related MDGs focused narrowly on particular diseases or conditions for select vulnerable groups, the SDGs are broader, calling (in SDG 3) for the global community to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. As we take on this challenge, it is useful to reflect on what we have learned and what we will need to do differently to make substantial progress towards the SDGs. For the past four decades, donors have mainly funded disease-specific programmes and global discourse has focused on the need for better primary care. In combination, these have contributed to remarkable progress in meeting many of the MDG health targets, especially those relating to child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. Targeted programmes and a primary care focus have been less successful, however, in achieving some of the other MDGs - most notably in the areas of maternal and neonatal mortality. While many papers and conferences have been devoted to the topic of health systems strengthening funding priorities and programmatic approaches have remained narrowly targeted on diseases, or on a single platform of delivery: primary care. Public health, health promotion, prevention, and controlling risk factors through a broad range of policy interventions, both within and outside the health sector, must be an important focus in the era of SDGs. However, delivering on the broad and ambitious SDG 3 will require an expansion in thinking to encompass the quality and efficiency of accessible care across the continuum of services - from community outreach, to primary and specialty clinics, to hospitals, and back to home or sub-acute settings. Countries such as China and Thailand that achieved the MDGs by investing in health care services broadly, rather than focusing only on specific interventions, saw dramatic progress in the health status of their entire populations. Within the continuum of care services, insufficient attention has been paid to access to high quality hospital services. In both low- and middle-income countries, hospital quality and safety has lagged; in 2009, 15.5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were lost due to in-hospital adverse events. Despite domestic resources in most countries being disproportionately allocated to hospital care, hospitals in many low-income countries are inaccessible or are in a dismal state. Even with comparatively large expenditures on hospitals versus other modes of delivery, total domestic health expenditures are often too low to provide a good quality health system. These conditions are exacerbated by ineffective spending and lack of management accountability. As a consequence, public hospitals in these countries are often dilapidated, lacking a reliable water supply, sanitation, and electricity. Drugs and other supplies may be unavailable, equipment is frequently broken, and basic infection control is absent. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for limited medical personnel to ensure good health outcomes. We argue that for personal health services, which are the focus of this perspective, it is now timely to rebalance the global health discourse and focus on the integration of primary care with essential hospital services. A strong health system needs both. The world has witnessed, particularly in Africa, a similar imbalance in the field of education. Indeed the education MDG, Goal 2, referred only to primary education. Secondary and especially higher education have been largely neglected, leaving once vibrant universities in sub-saharan Africa to decay. Lacking appropriate investment in all levels of education, this imbalance has left a legacy of critical skilled workforce shortage, including within the health workforce. SDG 4 attempts to remedy this gap by calling for universal, equal, and affordable access to secondary and tertiary education. Historically, hospitals-perhaps like seats of higher education-have been seen as cost-ineffective investments that divert needed resources from cost-effective primary interventions and disproportionately serve the better off. While it is true that in many countries hospital investments have been regressive with limited geographic and financial access for the poor, this need not be the case. By planning for varied levels of hospital services, expanding these services to underserved areas, and providing financial protection to access care, hospitals can be available for all those who need this level of care. To achieve SDG 3, a comprehensive health care system strengthening approach that includes primary care, district hospitals, and specialty institutions is important for several reasons. First, to meet the unfinished maternal and child health goals of preventing maternal mortality and eliminating avoidable pre-term and neonatal deaths (SDG 3.1, 3.2), access to well-functioning hospital services is essential. While strong antenatal care and skilled birth attendants are critical, referral to effective emergency and intensive obstetric and neonatal care are equally necessary. Second, the shift in the global burden of disease from acute infections to non-communicable diseases (NCDs, SDG 3.4), and chronic infections, such as HIV/AIDS, necessitates a high-quality continuum of care to prevent avoidable death and permanent disability once a patient has contracted the disease. More than three fourths of global deaths from ischemic heart disease occur in low- and middle-income countries; in Africa, more deaths are attributable to cancers than HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis together. While public health and primary care play an important role in both the prevention and treatment of NCDs, a complete care continuum must include hospitals to fill the role that lower acuity platforms cannot perform. Third, the global surgery agenda, recently elaborated by The Lancet Commission on Global Surgeryand the Essential Surgery volume of the Disease Control Priorities, Third Edition, estimates that five billion people lack access to safe surgical care. Of the 44 essential surgical interventions, all except six take place in hospitals. Providing these interventions would avert 1.5 million deaths per year, between 6 percent and 7 percent of all avertable deaths for low- and middle-income countries - greater than the individual burdens of HIV, malaria, or tuberculosis. Fourth, universal health coverage (UHC), including providing financial protection against impoverishment from health expenditures (SDG 3.8), requires coverage of hospital care. Households experiencing hospitalization are much more likely to suffer catastrophic health expenditure. Any UHC package that is to achieve its objectives must include an appropriate continuum of care that includes coverage for hospital care. Finally, as the Ebola epidemic has shown, health systems in low-income countries are not equipped to handle the challenges of a serious infectious epidemic. While the extent of the epidemic could have been contained through a solid surveillance system, diseases like Ebola have a natural history that requires acute, often hospital-level care, despite best efforts to intervene early. Availability of good hospital care that could provide intravenous fluids, medications, blood products, aggressive electrolyte replacement, and sound isolation practices is one of the factors that contributed to the lower case fatality rates of Ebola outside Africa. Moreover, Ebola is just one of many infectious diseases that can reach epidemic proportions without a strong continuum of care to effectively manage them, prevent death, and reduce transmission. Both countries and the international community need to develop and implement strategies to ensure that the continuum of care is available to all, irrespective of income and geography. In doing this, there is also an urgent need to greatly increase the effectiveness and quality of hospital care. While countries themselves will take the lead on this, there are four areas in which the international community can provide support. The total hospital infrastructure backlog is immense, across the developing world. The median number of hospital beds per 1,000 people in low- and middle-income countries are0.7 and 1.4, respectively, compared with 5.6 in high-income countries. The World Bank, Regional Development Banks, and the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank can do much to help. In addition, wealthy countries can share their expertise in innovative models for financing public infrastructure. While shortages in clinical personnel have been well documented, the need for a qualified managerial workforce is a neglected human resources crisis in many countries. In 2006, the World Health Report identified improving managerial capacity in low- and middle-income countries as the highest priority for country leaders if they are to address any of the other pressing clinical human resource deficiencies successfully. There are many models and tools to integrate services and provide cost-effective, patient-centered care in both high- and middle-income countries that can be innovatively adapted for use in low-resource settings. In many countries, this requires a pro-active stance by government in forming partnerships with non-governmental providers, including faith-based organizations, not-for-profit providers, and for-profit operators. This organized and regulated plurality of provision, including large scale public financing of private provision, is the norm in nearly every rich country, but remains extremely rare in the developing world. The SDGs call for health for all individuals, present and future. All platforms of care delivery are necessary for health system success, and none are individually sufficient. Building health systems with a long view-to sustainably preserve and attain health-requires an integrated approach where one platform supports, rather than competes with, another. Putting hospitals on the agenda alongside other platforms of care is not the whole solution, but it is a necessary part of the solution, if we are to have any likelihood of achieving the SDGs. ?

Within the continuum of care services, insufficient attention has been paid to access to high quality hospital services. To achieve SDG 3, a comprehensive health care system strengthening approach that includes primary care, district hospitals, and specialty institutions is important for several reasons. Fourth, universal health coverage (UHC), including providing financial protection against impoverishment from health expenditures (SDG 3.8), requires coverage of hospital care. Any UHC package that is to achieve its objectives must include an appropriate continuum of care that includes coverage for hospital care.",https://www.observerbd.com/2016/03/23/142929.php

"Superbugs kill 33,000 in Europe every year","Superbugs are killing about 33,000 people in Europe every year, according to a new report.The",,2018-11-06,The Daily Observer,"Superbugs kill 33,000 in Europe every year Superbugs are killing about 33,000 people in Europe every year, according to a new report. The study focused on five types of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the European Union and in the European Economic Area. Three quarters of those affected are due to healthcare associated infections -- in other words, the people fell ill with the disease while being treated in a medical facility. Therefore scientists believe the impact of these superbugs can be dramatically reduced through ""adequate infection prevention and control measures, as well as antibiotic stewardship,"" according to the report. Geographically, the situation was found to be worst in Italy and Greece, with about a third of the recorded deaths occurring in Italy. Researchers said: ""Even if one considers its large and ageing population, it is notable that about a third of the deaths due to infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA were in Italy."" The research found that the victims included people of all ages, though infants and the elderly proved to be the most vulnerable to infection. Almost two in five cases are caused by bacteria that are resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. The phenomenon ""is worrying because these antibiotics are the last treatment options available,"" the ECDC said in a statement. It added: ""When these are no longer effective, it is extremely difficult or, in many cases, impossible to treat infections."" CNN/SU The ""burden of infection"" -- measured in the number of cases, attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) -- of these superbugs is equivalent to that of flu, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which conducted the research.These deaths come as a ""direct consequence of an infection due to bacteria resistant to antibiotics,"" according to the authors of the report, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases on Monday.Scientists believe that around 70% of bacteria that cause infection are already resistant to at least one antibiotic that would otherwise be used to combat it.

Young Thais urged to forgo sex,,,,,"Valentines Day Young Thais urged to forgo sex Published : Thursday, 12 February, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 22 Valentines DayBANGKOK, Feb 11 : Bangkok city officials are urging young Thais to forgo sex on Valentines Day this weekend and visit temples instead, as a far better way to mark the day of love. Thailand has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Southeast Asia, public health officials say, and faces HIV infection rates among its gays comparable to those in Africas AIDS hotspots. The Feb. 14 celebrations are a popular Western import in tourist-friendly Thailand, but the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is worried about teenagers making love. Media surveys have shown teenagers in Thailand pick Valentines Day as the perfect day to lose their virginity. ""If kids really love each other, its better for them to go and free birds and fish or go to the temple,"" Pirapong Saicheua, an official of the city authority, told Reuters. Freeing caged birds is an auspicious Buddhist ritual that believers in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia see as a way of enhancing their merit, or karma. ""Better to put your minds at ease,"" Pirapong added. ""Dont obsess over something inappropriate for your age."" Predominantly Buddhist Thailand remains mostly conservative despite its reputation as a hotspot for gay bars, nightclubs and massage parlours. This year, an administration worried over the spike in teenage pregnancies has made available 3.5 million condoms in nearly 80 healthcare centres and city hospitals. Thailands health ministry also plans to install condom vending machines in high schools, said Sophon Mekthon, who heads the ministrys disease control department. Most students welcomed the project, first tested in 2010, but it was opposed by parents who fear the machines could encourage teenagers to have sex. ""Two out of three kids gave positive feedback, but around 90 percent of parents strongly disagreed,"" said Sophon. Still, young people in Bangkok say there is little chance of moral guardians persuading them to rein in sexual activity. ""I think sex cant be prohibited,"" said Khemaphat Santong, a 21-year-old student at the citys Chulalongkorn University. ""I mean, in some public places, yes, but stopping someone from doing it entirely is impossible."" ?REUTERS",{},"['bangkok', 'young', 'city', 'day', 'urged', 'worried', 'valentines', 'thailand', 'way', 'teenagers', 'thais', 'sex', 'forgo']","Valentine's Day Young Thais urged to forgo sex Published : Thursday, 12 February, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 22Valentine's DayBANGKOK, Feb 11 : Bangkok city officials are urging young Thais to forgo sex on Valentine's Day this weekend and visit temples instead, as a far better way to mark the day of love.

The strategy follows pioneering projects credited with bringing down murder rates in Chicago and Glasgow, two cities blighted by violent crime. In 2018 so far, the British capital has recorded 133 murders, around two-thirds of them stabbings. ""Violence meets the definition of an epidemic health problem,"" Charlie Ransford, of Cure Violence -- an American NGO founded by former World Health Organisation (WHO) worker Gary Slutkin which has pioneered the strategy -- told AFP. ""We can address it using the same techniques that we use to address other epidemics."" Modelled on WHO strategies for combatting the spread of diseases like Ebola or HIV/AIDS, it treats violence like a similarly contagious phenomenon, trying to turn the tide in three stages. The immediate priority is limiting transmission, followed by tackling behaviour that fuels the spread, before focusing on changing community norms that allowed the epidemic to begin. This final part can include better job training and employment placement, as well as so-called ""second chance"" schemes for offenders. Authorities in Scotland adopted the approach in 2005, after it was branded the most dangerous nation in the developed world in a United Nations report that noted 2,000 Scots were assaulted each week. They set up the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit (SVRU) to implement this novel approach, its director Niven Rennie told AFP. ""It started 10 years ago and we reduced the homicide rate by over 50 percent in that period,"" she said. The unit followed its own three-step strategy. It first strengthened the penalties for carrying a weapon or for perpetrators of aggression, aiming to isolate them and limit the spread of violence. The SVRU then identified those most at risk, to give them ""options to move away from being involved in gangs, to get a stabilised life,"" according to Rennie. ""We found that people that were involved in knife crime and involved in violence didnt actually want to be involved in it, wanted a way out,"" she said. Finally, from 2012 the unit developed prevention strategies in schools and hospitals to consolidate progress. While domestic and sexual violence remains a concern, Scotland has become a model for successfully tackling the problem -- with Londons leaders now hurrying to Glasgow to learn from its experiences. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has launched his own ""violence reduction unit"", while the London borough of Lambeth -- one of the areas most impacted by youth violence -- is in the early stages of developing its own public health approach. Its plan will be guided by ""key principles"" which include a multi-agency approach targeting ""young people already involved in violence, or at risk of being involved in violence"", according to its draft strategy. - Dont feel safe - Over 70 percent of Londoners aged eight to 24 are exposed to ""serious violence"" at least once a month, according to a survey conducted by the Youth Violence Commission. ""We do have to understand the fear young people have in the streets,"" said Duncan Bew of Kings College Hospitals Trauma Centre. ""Young people in particular have started carrying weapons because they dont feel safe."" He admitted frustration at seeing the same youngsters showing up at his hospital, ""particularly those patients who are vulnerable, coming to harm when it could have been prevented"". Despite London authorities willingness to adopt the Scotland model, criminologist Simon Harding, of the University of West London, warned it would not be easy to apply across the capital. ""To make it work, they have to involve the communities,"" he said, adding previous attempts had ""tended to tell the community what we are going to do to them"". ""This has to be different... because it is the community that has the answers,"" Harding said. -AFP",{},"['london', 'health', 'youth', 'public', 'unit', 'spread', 'scotland', 'treat', 'epidemic', 'strategy', 'crime', 'involved', 'tries', 'problem', 'knife', 'violence', 'surge']","LONDON, Dec 21: Faced with spiralling youth violence and knife crime, authorities in London have decided to treat the issues as a public health problem, deploying similar tactics from the fight against disease epidemics.

Humans are to blame for the rise in dangerous viral infections,"Today, we hear about dangerous viral infections around the world on a regular basis. Social media and internet access may be an obvious explanation for their seeming increase. But it doesn't just seem this way. The number of viruses and the infections they cause are truly increasing. Scientific advances, the way humans live today and virus biology all contribute to the rise of viruses.New viruses, all the time:It seems viral infections are everywhere these days. Starting from January 2018, Nigeria has been experiencing an unusually large outbreak of haemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus. There have been more than 400 confirmed infections and 100 deaths to date. The southern Indian state of Kerala is battling an outbreak of the rare Nipah virus, which causes severe inflammation of the brain and claimed the lives of 14 people in May.The Brazilian outbreak of viral yellow fever that began in late 2017 has moved into highly populated areas near S�o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. One-third of the 723 people with confirmed infections have so far died from the illness. We're no doubt more aware of such serious diseases after the unprecedented 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa that claimed more than 11,000 lives. And then the 2015-2017 Zika virus outbreak that closely followed during which 3,500 babies were born with nervous system or eye damage.The first report of human virus infection was yellow fever in the US army at the turn of the 20th century. And now, estimates suggest three to four new species of human viruses are found each year and around 250 human virus species are yet to be discovered. Discovery of a new virus today is complex and requires many steps. Typically, it involves describing its complete genetic code with a combination of intensive molecular sequencing work in the laboratory and computational analyses using enormous reference databases. Medical epidemiological studies (that look at the distribution of disease) and biological experiments are then needed to understand any virus as a dangerous human pathogen. It may then take some time to link a virus with a particular human disease.For instance, human par echoviruses (which can cause severe disease in young children) were discovered in the 1950s. But they were only identified as a cause of disease in young children in 2004. And relatively large Australian epidemics since 2013 have highlighted their link to a serious sepsis-like illness and potential for developmental complications.How humans contribute:Modern humans contribute to the success of dangerous viruses. A virus replicates only when inside the cell of a living being, and spreads most efficiently when there is contact between two individuals. The United Nations measures current world population growth at more than 1 per cent per year. From the virus' perspective, potential incubators are increasing. The world's population is also urbanising, which means people living in closer proximity, which is conducive to spread of a virus. Domestic and international mass transport permits viruses to move between regional populations. Many dangerous virus infections are zoo-noses, which are diseases transmitted to humans from other animals. Bats are a common culprit -- one theory is that a unique low-grade immune system allows them to carry a relatively high number of viruses without developing disease. Epidemics caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus probably began through bat-human contact.Expanding settlement towards wilderness areas provides more opportunities for viruses to meet people. Domesticated livestock may carry viruses that infect humans, and the growing human population dictates increasing and more compact livestock production. Influenza virus infects pigs, cattle and poultry as well as humans. The H7N9 strain that has infected more than 1,500 people in China and resulted in the death of one-third since 2013, first moved to humans from diseased poultry.When it comes to numbers though, the most important viral transporter is the mosquito. The bite of certain Aedes mosquitoes, for instance, is the primary route for infection with dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. Queensland is home to these mosquitoes, so outbreaks of dengue occur annually, usually due to an infected traveller arriving from an endemic region. Research conducted in the Amazon has linked expansion of the mosquito range in endemic areas to deforestation and low re-vegetation. Resistance to the relatively few available insecticides may also contribute to their population growth.Why viruses are sneaky:The basic biology of viruses contributes to their capacity to cause disease. Most human viruses replicate almost instantaneously and in huge numbers. As a result, mutations arise at a high rate in the genetic code of a virus. This allows the virus to adapt quickly to an adverse environment, such as the human immune system or drugs. It may also allow a virus to jump from an animal host to humans. Some viruses establish a chronic infection, which extends the potential for transmission. After acute illness, Ebola virus hides for many months in parts of the body that generate weak inflammatory responses, such as the sexual organs, the brain and/or the eye.And although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may cause an acute illness, there is usually a long delay between infection and the onset of any disease. Consequently infected people may pass on HIV for years before being aware that they carry the virus. There are no specific drugs for most dangerous human viruses. This is in part because viruses are a fast growing and diverse group, with no common drug targets to exploit, as has been possible with antibiotics for bacteria.But another challenge relates to the viral life cycle, which uses the infected person's cell machinery. Drugs that target the growth of viruses therefore have effects on the person's cell, which may result in drug side effects. Also, the capacity of a virus to adapt implies the potential to develop resistance to a drug. Drug treatment for HIV infection involves a combination of drugs with different actions to address this problem.Despite the many challenges associated with dangerous viruses, research continues to yield even more innovative solutions. The World Mosquito Program, run out of Monash University, is one example. This program is based on the discovery that a safe and natural bacteria, Wolbachia, stops viral growth in the mosquito. Insects in regions endemic with mosquito-borne diseases are being infected with Wolbachia to break the transmission cycle. Ultimately, the cunning strategies used by dangerous viruses are no match for the wide breadth of human ingenuity.Justine R Smith Professor of Eye & Vision Health, Flinders University & Jill Carr Associate Professor, Flinders University Source: The Conversation",,,The Daily Observer,"New viruses, all the time: It seems viral infections are everywhere these days.

A virus replicates only when inside the cell of a living being, and spreads most efficiently when there is contact between two individuals. The United Nations measures current world population growth at more than 1 per cent per year. From the virus perspective, potential incubators are increasing. The worlds population is also urbanising, which means people living in closer proximity, which is conducive to spread of a virus. Domestic and international mass transport permits viruses to move between regional populations. Many dangerous virus infections are zoo-noses, which are diseases transmitted to humans from other animals. Bats are a common culprit -- one theory is that a unique low-grade immune system allows them to carry a relatively high number of viruses without developing disease. Epidemics caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus probably began through bat-human contact.Expanding settlement towards wilderness areas provides more opportunities for viruses to meet people. Domesticated livestock may carry viruses that infect humans, and the growing human population dictates increasing and more compact livestock production. Influenza virus infects pigs, cattle and poultry as well as humans. The H7N9 strain that has infected more than 1,500 people in China and resulted in the death of one-third since 2013, first moved to humans from diseased poultry.When it comes to numbers though, the most important viral transporter is the mosquito. The bite of certain Aedes mosquitoes, for instance, is the primary route for infection with dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. Queensland is home to these mosquitoes, so outbreaks of dengue occur annually, usually due to an infected traveller arriving from an endemic region. Research conducted in the Amazon has linked expansion of the mosquito range in endemic areas to deforestation and low re-vegetation. Resistance to the relatively few available insecticides may also contribute to their population growth.Why viruses are sneaky:The basic biology of viruses contributes to their capacity to cause disease. Most human viruses replicate almost instantaneously and in huge numbers. As a result, mutations arise at a high rate in the genetic code of a virus. This allows the virus to adapt quickly to an adverse environment, such as the human immune system or drugs. It may also allow a virus to jump from an animal host to humans. Some viruses establish a chronic infection, which extends the potential for transmission. After acute illness, Ebola virus hides for many months in parts of the body that generate weak inflammatory responses, such as the sexual organs, the brain and/or the eye.And although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may cause an acute illness, there is usually a long delay between infection and the onset of any disease. Consequently infected people may pass on HIV for years before being aware that they carry the virus. There are no specific drugs for most dangerous human viruses. This is in part because viruses are a fast growing and diverse group, with no common drug targets to exploit, as has been possible with antibiotics for bacteria.But another challenge relates to the viral life cycle, which uses the infected persons cell machinery. Drugs that target the growth of viruses therefore have effects on the persons cell, which may result in drug side effects. Also, the capacity of a virus to adapt implies the potential to develop resistance to a drug. Drug treatment for HIV infection involves a combination of drugs with different actions to address this problem.Ultimately, the cunning strategies used by dangerous viruses are no match for the wide breadth of human ingenuity.Justine R SmithProfessor of Eye & Vision Health, Flinders University & Jill CarrAssociate Professor, Flinders UniversitySource: The Conversation",{},"['blame', 'virus', 'outbreak', 'viral', 'infections', 'viruses', 'humans', 'disease', 'human', 'rise', 'infection', 'dangerous']","The first report of human virus infection was yellow fever in the US army at the turn of the 20th century.

Unleashing Africa's girl power,,,,,"Sub-Saharan Africas economies have boomed in recent years. But the headline figures often mask longer-term problems - not least, an over-reliance on natural resources and chronic inequalities. Inclusive, sustainable growth is achievable, but only by tapping the continents greatest reserve of energy and creativity: African women and girls. Health and development experts, economists, non-governmental organisations, United Nations agencies, and banks agree that the key to unlocking Africas potential lies in expanding womens education, freedom, and job opportunities. Today, many African women are not only expected to fulfil traditional roles, such as raising children and caring for the elderly; they also face legal and social discrimination regarding land and property ownership, inheritance, education, and access to credit and technology - in addition to oppressive sexual mores and violence. Yet gender equality is necessary for the continents well-being. Consider the pressing issue of food security. Women comprise half of the agriculture sectors workforce, growing, selling, buying, and preparing food for their families. Studies suggest that equal access to resources would increase farm yields by 20-30 per cent, offsetting the effects of drought and climate change. Access to education, capital, markets, and technologies would allow women to process, package, and market their products, especially for Africas growing middle class, bolstering both earnings and food supplies. Agriculture is but one example. Greater female participation in male-dominated occupations across the board would increase overall labour productivity by up to 25 per cent. The same is true of politics, where more female participation and leadership would improve governance and public services, as promising experiences in some parts of Africa and elsewhere have shown. The first step to improving conditions for women must be to strengthen their sexual and reproductive health and rights - an issue concerning which Africa has some of the worlds worst indicators. Simply put, women must be allowed to decide, free of coercion or violence, about their sexuality and health; if, when, and whom to marry; and whether and when to become a parent. This cannot happen without providing women and girls with the information, education, and services they need to make their own decisions. Sexual and reproductive health issues exact a huge yet largely avoidable toll on African women, their families, and communities. The costs usually strike in the prime of womens economically productive lives, devaluing their future contributions to society. At the extreme, more than 400 African women and girls die every day during pregnancy or childbirth, scarring families and plunging surviving children into hardship. Many of these deaths are caused by the estimated five million unsafe abortions carried out annually in Sub-Saharan Africa. The cost to society in lost income from death and disability is nearly $1 billion. Almost all of these deaths occur in countries with restrictive abortion laws, which African leaders should consider reforming as a matter of common sense and social justice. A prime focus should be on protecting the most vulnerable - adolescent girls. More than one-third of African girls marry before the age of 18, which threatens their health, truncates their education, and lowers their aspirations for the future. They are also more likely than older women to die of birth-related complications, and are more prone to abuse. Though most African states outlaw early or forced marriages, enforcement is weak. African girls are also disproportionately vulnerable to contracting HIV. Roughly 90 per cent of the worlds pregnant women and children with HIV live in Africa, and, despite notable recent reductions in HIV transmission rates, adolescent girls are still more than twice as likely as boys of the same age to carry the virus. Yet barely a third of young Africans know how to prevent HIV - another reason for urgent and comprehensive sexuality education. Another epidemic afflicting African women is violence, all too often perpetrated with impunity. Sexual violence is used as a tactic of war. But it is also a disturbing feature of home life; 37 per cent of African women report having been abused by their partner. In the case of female genital mutilation and child marriage, such violence is culturally sanctioned. We must change laws, judicial systems, and attitudes that exonerate the perpetrators, and we must provide help to victims. Attitudes can change. Contraception, for example, was once a contentious issue. Today, most African leaders accept it as an important, cost-effective investment and as part of their countries economic-development strategies. Basic family planning in 16 Sub-Saharan countries could save more than $1 billion in education costs alone. The number of maternal deaths could fall by one-third, saving millions (in developing countries overall, maternal and new-born health-care savings could reach $5.7 billion). However, the sad reality is that, despite support from various development partners and donors, assistance for reproductive health care and family planning fell by half in the last decade. The compounding benefits of ending legal, economic and gender discrimination are vast. Healthier, wealthier, and better-educated women tend to produce healthier, wealthier, and better-educated families, because women typically invest more of their earnings than men do in their childrens wellbeing. With the continents population forecast to double by 2050, there is hardly a better time to invest in women and girls. It is as much an economic as an ethical argument.r Joaquim Chissano, former President of Mozambique, co-chairs the High-Level Task Force for the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)",{},"['women', 'education', 'health', 'girl', 'africas', 'girls', 'african', 'hiv', 'countries', 'cent', 'families', 'power', 'unleashing', 'violence']","Inclusive, sustainable growth is achievable, but only by tapping the continent's greatest reserve of energy and creativity: African women and girls.

"Superbugs to ‘kill millions’ by 2050 unless countries act, warn experts","PARIS, Nov 7: Millions of people in Europe, North America and Australia will die from superbug infections unless countries prioritise fighting the growing threat posed by bacteria immune to most known drugs, experts predicted on Wednesday. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned of",,2018-11-08,The Daily Observer,"PARIS, Nov 7: Millions of people in Europe, North America and Australia will die from superbug infections unless countries prioritise fighting the growing threat posed by bacteria immune to most known drugs, experts predicted on Wednesday. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned of ""disastrous consequences"" for public healthcare and spending unless basic hospital hygiene is boosted and unnecessary antibiotic use slashed. Drug-resistant bacteria killed more than 33,000 people in Europe in 2015, according to new research published separately this week. In a landmark report, the OECD said 2.4 million people could die from superbugs by 2050 and said the cost of treating such infections would balloon to an average of $3.5 billion (three billion euros) a year in each country included in its analysis. Michele Cecchini, lead on public health at the OECD, told AFP that countries were already spending an average of 10 percent of their healthcare budgets on treating antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bugs. ""AMR costs more than the flu, more than HIV, more than tuberculosis. And it will cost even more if countries dont put into place actions to tackle this problem,"" he said. ""Enormous death toll"" As humans consume ever more antibiotics -- either through prescriptions or agriculture and livestock products given medicines to stave off infection -- strains of bacteria are developing that resist the effects of drugs designed to kill them. In low and middle-income countries, resistance is already high: in Indonesia Brazil and Russia up to 60 percent of bacterial infections are already resistant to at least one antibiotic. And the growth of AMR infections is predicted to be between four and seven times faster by 2030 than currently. ""Such high resistance rates in health care systems, which are already weakened by constrained budgets, will create the conditions for an enormous death toll that will be mainly borne by new-borns, very young children and the elderly,"" the report said. ""Even small cuts in the kitchen, minor surgery or diseases like pneumonia could become life-threatening."" Perhaps more worrying is the prediction made by the OECD that resistance to so-called 2nd- and 3rd-line antibiotics -- break-glass-in-case-of-emergency infection treatments -- will balloon by 70 percent by 2030. ""These are antibiotics that as far as possible we dont want to use because we want these as back up,"" Cecchini said. ""Essentially, we are using more when we should use less and we are running out of our best options in case of emergency."" How to avoid disaster The group, which advises the World Health Organization on public health initiatives, said the only way to avert disaster was to implement immediate, sector-wide changes in behaviour.

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Observer, she talked about the status of Tobacco Control efforts in Bangladesh as well as the impact of Meena Cartoon on the development of girl child. Recipient of several Indian and international awards, Mira Aghi has Ph.D degree on Psychology from the Loyola University of Chicago, USA. Apart from that she received training on developing television programmes for children and had attended Communication Research and Production conducted by Dr AD Palmer in New York. Moreover, she worked with UNESCO, HIV/AIDS, Drug Abuse and Youth Development as consultant for a long time. She also served as consultant to UNDP, UN Women, Unicef, UNFPA, and WHO. In an exclusive interview with The Daily Observer she said Bangladesh government has achieved tremendous success in the area of Tobacco Control, but still some loopholes in the law need to be plugged for proper implementation of the Tobacco Control Act. She said to make the law effective the most important tools will be graphic health warnings on all tobacco packets. Mira Aghi said the tobacco companies are mainly responsible for slow implementation of the law. She suggested that for the implementation of the existing laws all provisions should be put to work together. A large number of people are involved in cultivation of tobacco. The tobacco companies say if this business is stopped then they will become jobless. This she felt was a lame excuse. The excerpts of the interview are as follows: Daily Observer: You have worked as the director of creative research, on the Meena Communications which aimed at changing the behaviour and attitudes of the people in South Asian countries towards the girl child. Do you think this project has brought about any change in the mindset of people in South Asia? Mira Aghi: Of course, it brought a great change. In Bangladesh, when I talked to a group of mothers about equal treatment of their kids, they started talking to me about the Meena episode ""Dividing the mango"" equally between Meena and her brother. In South Asia, there is a tradition of giving more care and love to sons more than the daughters. To break this tradition the Meena cartoon put emphasis on equal treatment of both boys and girls to give the message that girls and boys all are equal and they should be treated equally in every regard. This group of mothers shared their feelings with me, that after watching this episode they were determined they would give equal treatment to their boys and girls. Daily Observer: Why do we not see any other animation initiative like the Meena Communications? Mira Aghi: Well, we have different plans and projects, we will introduce other animations like Meena Communications in future as a tool to make people aware of and conscious about many things including health, dowry and others. Daily Observer: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina very recently for the first time attended a girl summit in London, where she mentioned the issue of early marriage as a big problem in South Asia. Do you think Meena can be used as means to prevent it? Mira Aghi: Definitely. Let me tell you that one of the episodes of Meena Cartoon was focused on early marriage. And it talked about how it was very difficult for the parents to defer early marriage of their daughters, but through the Meena a message was given that a daughter should not be married off until she is 18. And it also gave other pieces of information, such as if a girl is married in her early age, she is thrown into lots of problems including the danger that she can die during the time of childbirth. Through the Meena, we also addressed the problem of dowry. The great effect of the film was the boys started thinking that they would not take dowry from the girls family and they realized that taking dowry was not a good practice and both the families came to an agreement that no dowry would be given or taken. ?The rest of inverview will be published tomorrow Dr Mira Aghi, a UN consultant who has worked on different issues relating to development, recently came to Bangladesh.

Transgender community deserves attention,,,,,"Transgender community deserves attention Md Sazedul Islam Published :Thursday, 22 October, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 21 Hijras face violence, discrimination and rejection also from workplaces, educational institutions and society. They often cannot access the same services and rights as other citizens, and are vulnerable to poorer health. Being rejected, they take shelter among other Hijras. They have a Guru and remain under the Guru. The social identity of Hijras is based on commitment to their way of life such as allegiance to a guru, to the pooling of earnings and submission to group rules. Their own communities, centred on their gurus, are the social worlds in which they live and protect themselves from the extremely marginalised position they hold in Bangladesh society today. Hijras are stigmatised people. So, like all other stigmatised people, they are marginalised and have to lead their life in a different pattern. Usually they cannot mix with general people. They have no normal sexual organ but they have sexual desires. They fulfil their desire in different ways. Hijras in Bangladesh are predominantly Muslims. There are some Hindus too. The community is actually an amalgam of many religions. In every sector, including health, education, housing and employment, they face extreme discrimination. Disowned by the family, the state and the society, they are sometimes found to be involved in resorting to extortion. Hijras face prejudice at every turn. Marked out by their sexual difference, they are hounded out of schools, and hence lack the necessary qualifications to get proper jobs. Its almost impossible for them to become educated, to get a passport, or even to open a bank account. The third gender or transgender is an identity-based category for people who do not identify themselves as either male or female. This may include people who want to perform or want to be presented as a gender that is different than the one which was assigned to them at birth, based on genitalia or other criteria. It can also include people who do not feel the male or female gender roles that their culture dictates in terms of social, sexual or gender role preference. Hijras or hermaphrodites are people with ambiguous genitalia. Also called intersexed, hermaphroditism is primarily a medical condition which results from multifarious biological factors. The term intersexed is reserved to refer to a somatic condition in which the hermaphroditic person is supposed to posses both masculine and feminine traits. Hijras of Bangladesh regard themselves as people incapable of sexual sensation. They also claim to have neither a male nor female genitalia. They wear womens clothing such as sari, salwar kameez, and dance and sing, in general, behave as women. In Bangladesh, this community remains socially excluded, living on the fringes of society. Most make a living by singing and dancing at weddings or childbirth, many have moved to begging and prostitution. There are no authentic statistics on how many Hijras are there in Bangladesh. According to newspaper reports, the number varies from 30,000 to 150,000. A decision was made by the government of Bangladesh acknowledging the Hijra as third gender on November 11, 2013, but their condition is yet to be improved. Hijra community in the country is discriminated against, only due to their sexual identity. Lack of education is a major problem for them, because of which they are not aware of their rights. Due to their low educational status, lack of alternative profession, associated stigma, discrimination and violence, Hijras are mostly at risk of getting infected as well as transmitting HIV to their clients. While overall HIV prevalence remains under 0.1 per cent among the general population in Bangladesh, there are risk factors that could fuel the spread of HIV AIDS among high-risk groups. Prompt and dynamic action is needed to reinforce the quality and coverage of HIV prevention programmes, particularly among the high risk group, including Hijras. We cannot build a better Bangladesh by ignoring and excluding a large number of people. So, necessary steps should be taken to solve the problems of the community. Bandhu Social Welfare Society (BSWS), a NGO working on sexual minorities, placed demands for protecting the rights of the community. The demands include commitment to ensure support from different sectors of the government, job opportunities for Hijras, ensure free health services from government hospitals and community clinics, ensure voting card from city corporation to all Hijras, support in renting dwelling places and lease/allocation of the khas land for the community and proper religious ritual after death. BSWS also mentioned a number of challenges, which need to be addressed. These are: misconception about Hijra community in the mainstream society, including media, lack of comprehensive programmes to supplement the gazette notification, lack of acceptance of the community in the mainstream society, no provision for third gender in government form-formats, subdued and sarcastic presentation of Hijras in cinemas and media and almost no job provision with Hijra identity. We need to address and concerns of human rights abuse and denial of sexual health rights, and provide a right-based approach to health and social services for the most stigmatized and vulnerable populations in Bangladesh. We need to ensure the legal rights of transgender people in the state as there is no room for discrimination in the law or constitution. Immediate actions need to be taken to get equal opportunity in education, treatment and employment and introduction of quotas in educational institutes, public services and parliament as well. A wholesome law need to be formed soon that would address each problem faced by the community individually and target to solve them. Creating new employment opportunities for the transgender individuals is necessary. Suitable employment and developing effective strategies need to be formulated. Article 28 (1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh states The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race caste, sex or place of birth. Building a society where everyone is treated with proper respect regardless of sex, age and religion is our constitutional right. Raising awareness and change of attitude of people towards Hijras would help reintegrate them into the mainstream of the society. If they are provided support and the right environment to nurture their true potential, they can be a productive part of the society, contributing to national development. We should accept the issue as diversity not as abnormality. They should be given a different gender identity in order to get rid of identity conflict. Short term projects for the improvement for the Hijra community cannot be a solution, but a change in social perspective is necessary in order to ensure a proper place in the family and all other places of society.r Md Sazedul Islam is a journalist. Email: Though a part of human being, Hijras (known as transgender) are leading an inhuman life in our country. Their sufferings know no bound. In our society, people have reservation about Hijras who are misunderstood and unaccepted in the society. If any Hijra is born to a family, the family declined to accept him as a member. Hence, they are rejected and driven out by the family and the society, resulting in deprivation of their rights.Hijras face violence, discrimination and rejection also from workplaces, educational institutions and society.

The World Bank needs to return to its mission,"With a clear plan, the World Bank would be able to find partners to help it support progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which has been disappointing so far. Instead, the Bank is adopting an approach that would leave poor countries mired in debt, by relying on Wall Street to finance their basic needs.The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity. These goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. But the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy, and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington. The Bank's president, Jim Yong Kim, should find a better way forward, and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes.Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005, to scale up the world's response to the AIDS epidemic. Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard University's Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope.I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits. I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism, a global fund, to fight AIDS, and a new funding effort by the United States.In early 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program. The World Health Organization, led by the Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, recruited Kim to lead the WHO's scale-up effort. Kim did a fantastic job, and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions, saving lives, livelihoods, and families.There are four lessons of that great success. First, the private sector was an important partner, by offering patent-protected drugs at production cost. Drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations.

On the contrary, rather than embrace the SDGs, the Bank is practically mute, and its officials have even been heard to mutter negatively about them in the corridors of power.Perhaps US President Donald Trump doesn't want to hear about his government's responsibilities vis-vis the SDGs.

Instead, the Bank is adopting an approach that would leave poor countries mired in debt, by relying on Wall Street to finance their basic needs. The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity. These goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. But the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy, and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington. The Banks president, Jim Yong Kim, should find a better way forward, and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes. Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005, to scale up the worlds response to the AIDS epidemic. Partners in Health, the NGO led by Kim and his colleague, Harvard Universitys Paul Farmer, had used antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV-infected rural residents in Haiti, and had restored them to health and hope. I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits. I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism, a global fund, to fight AIDS, and a new funding effort by the United States. In early 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program. The World Health Organization, led by the Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland, recruited Kim to lead the WHOs scale-up effort. Kim did a fantastic job, and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions, saving lives, livelihoods, and families. There are four lessons of that great success. First, the private sector was an important partner, by offering patent-protected drugs at production cost. Drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations. They recognized that patent rights, if exercised to excess, would be a death warrant for millions of poor people. Second, the effort was supported by private philanthropy, led by Bill Gates, who inspired others to contribute as well. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation backed the new Global Fund, the WHO, and the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, which I led for the WHO in 2000-2001 (and which successfully campaigned for increased donor funding to fight AIDS and other killer diseases).

"$25 a year per woman can prevent most maternal, newborn deaths!",,,,,"$25 a year per woman can prevent most maternal, newborn deaths! Banani Mallick Published : Saturday, 6 December, 2014, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 12 Spending US$25 per woman each year would dramatically reduce maternal and newborn deaths. a joint report of two renowned organisations say. A new report, the joint work of two renowned organizations, finds a staggering lack of basic sexual and reproductive health services in developing countries. The report, released by the Guttmacher Institute and UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, recently analyzed data from a wide range of sources, including survey data from women in developing countries, to document the number of women who lack services, what it would cost to meet their needs, and the benefits of meeting these needs. Guttamacher Institute is a non-profit organization which works to advance reproductive health. The institute operates in the US and globally through an interrelated programme of social science research, policy analysis and public education. The report suggests that about tens of millions of women do not receive the basic pregnancy and delivery care for their health and their newborn babies. ""Over the past two decades, we have achieved striking progress in making pregnancy and childbirth safer in developing countries. Despite those gains, these new findings make clear that universal access to sexual and reproductive health services must remain a global health priority requiring urgent attention,"" said Ann Starrs, President and CEO of the Guttmacher Institute. The study calculates that it would cost on average $25 per woman aged 15 to 49, roughly double the current level of spending, to provide a package of essential sexual and reproductive health services to all women in developing regions each year. The amount of money will include contraceptive services, pregnancy and newborn care, services for pregnant women living with HIV, including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the virus, and treatment for four other sexually transmitted infections. ""This report is an urgent call to action for increased investments in sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning. These investments save lives, empower women and girls, strengthen health systems and have a profound and lasting impact on development,"" said Dr Babatunde Osotimehin, Executive Director of UNFPA. ""We must ensure the quality of services and availability of a full range of choices so women and men can get the health care they need."" Providing this basic package of services to all women who need them in developing countries would have a dramatic impact. If all women wanting to avoid pregnancy used a modern contraceptive method, the number of unintended pregnancies would drop by 70 per cent and unsafe abortions by 74 per cent. The research report suggest that the number of women dying from pregnancy-related causes would drop by two thirds, from 290,000 to 96,000, newborn deaths would drop by more than three-fourths, from 2.9 million to 660,000, transmission of HIV from mothers to newborns would be nearly eliminated. The report, which presents findings from Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, found that the situation varies widely by region. According to the analysis, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the average annual cost of providing a woman with the needed health care would be $31, compared with $14 per woman in Asia. However, costs would be significantly higher-$76 per woman-in sub-Saharan Africa, the subregion with the greatest need for services and where health systems are generally weakest, the report discloses. Currently, of the 125 million women in developing countries who give birth every year, there are 54 million who do not receive adequate antenatal care, 43 million do not deliver in a health facility, 21 million women and 33 million newborns do not receive care for medical complications, 550,000 pregnant women living with HIV do not receive treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Differences within regions are also considerable. In East Africa, 42 per cent of women deliver in a health facility, compared with 62 per cent in Middle Africa and 87 per cent in Southern Africa. In Asia, just 32 per cent of the poorest women deliver in facilities, compared with 92 per cent of the wealthiest women.",{},"['women', 'health', 'woman', 'deaths', 'reproductive', 'maternal', 'prevent', '25', 'care', 'cent', 'million', 'services', 'newborn', 'report', 'developing']","$25 a year per woman can prevent most maternal, newborn deaths!

Ending violence against women,"Various forms of violenceIt is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives. However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. Women who have experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence report higher rates of depression, having an abortion and acquiring HIV, compared to women who have not.Similar to data from other regions, in all four countries of a multi-country study from the Middle East and North Africa, men who witnessed their fathers using violence against their mothers, and men who experienced some form of violence at home as children, were significantly more likely to report perpetrating intimate partner violence in their adult relationships. For example, in Lebanon the likelihood of perpetrating physical violence was more than three times higher among men who had witnessed their fathers beating their mothers during childhood than those who did not .It is estimated that of all women who were the victims of homicide globally in 2012, almost half were killed by intimate partners or family members, compared to less than six per cent of men killed in the same year. In Latin America and the Caribbean according to official data from 16 countries, a total of 2, 554 women were victims of femicide in 2017.Adult women account for 51 per cent of all human trafficking victims detected globally. Women and girls together account for 71 per cent, with girls representing nearly three out of every four child trafficking victims. Nearly three out of every four trafficked women and girls are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation [4].It is estimated that there are 650 million women and girls in the world today who were married before age 18. During the past decade, the global rate of child marriage has declined-from one in four young women (aged 20-24) being married as children, to almost one in five. Still, in West and Central Africa-where this harmful practice is most common-over four out of 10 young women were married before their 18th Child marriage often results in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupts schooling, limits the girl's opportunities and increases her risk of experiencing domestic violence.At least 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone female genital mutilation in the 30 countries with representative data on prevalence. In most of these countries, the majority of girls were cut before age five. With population movement, female genital mutilation is becoming a practice with global dimensions, in particular among migrant and refugee women and girls.Approximately 15 million adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19) worldwide have experienced forced sex (forced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts) at some point in their life. Out of these, 9 million adolescent girls were victimized within the past year. In the vast majority of countries, adolescent girls are most at risk of forced sex by a current/former husband, partner or boyfriend. Based on data from 30 countries, only one per cent ever sought professional help. Globally, one out of three students (aged 11 and 13 to 15 years) have been bullied by their peers at school at least on one day in the past month, with girls and boys equally likely to experience bullying. However, boys are more likely to experience physical bullying than girls, and girls are more likely to experience psychological bullying, particularly being ignored or left out or subject to nasty rumours. Girls also report being made fun of because of how their face or body looks more frequently than boys. School-related gender-based violence is a major obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls.Twenty-three per cent of female undergraduate university students reported having experienced sexual assault or sexual misconduct in a survey across 27 universities in the United States in 2015. Rates of reporting to campus officials, law enforcement or others ranged from five to 28 per cent, depending on the specific type of behavior.One in 10 women in the European Union report having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15 (including having received unwanted, offensive sexually explicit emails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on social networking sites). The risk is highest among young women between 18 and 29 years of age.In a multi-country study from the Middle East and North Africa, between 40 and 60 per cent of women said they had ever experienced street-based sexual harassment (mainly sexual comments, stalking/following, or staring/ogling), and 31 per cent to 64 per cent of men said they had ever carried out such acts. Younger men, men with more education, and men who experienced violence as children were more likely to engage in street sexual harassment.Results from a national Australian survey show that almost two out of five women (39 per cent) aged 15 and older who have been in the workforce in the last five years have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace during that period, compared to one out of four (26 per cent) of their male counterparts. Regarding most common perpetrators, in almost 4 out of 5 cases (79 per cent) one or more of the perpetrators were male.Eighty-two per cent of women parliamentarians who participated in a study conducted by the Inter-parliamentary Union in 39 countries across 5 regions reported having experienced some form of psychological violence (remarks, gestures and images of a sexist or humiliating sexual nature made against them or threats and/or mobbing) while serving their terms. They cited social media as the main channel through which such psychological violence is perpetrated; nearly half of those surveyed (44 per cent) reported having received death, rape, assault or abduction threats towards them or their families. Sixty-five per cent had been subjected to sexist remarks, primarily by male colleagues in parliament and from opposing parties as well as their own. Measures to address violenceIn the majority of countries with available data, less than 40 per cent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort. Among women who do, most look to family and friends and very few look to formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than 10 per cent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police.At least 144 countries have passed laws on domestic violence, and 154 have laws on sexual harassment. However, even when laws exist, this does not mean they are always compliant with international standards and recommendations or implemented .Availability of data on violence against women has increased significantly in recent years. Since 1995, more than 100 countries have conducted at least one survey addressing the issue. More than 40 countries conducted at least two surveys in the period between 1995 and 2014, which means that, depending on the comparability of the surveys, changes over time could be analysed. Leaving no one behindEvidence suggests that certain characteristics of women, such as sexual orientation, disability status or ethnicity, and some contextual factors, such as humanitarian crises, including conflict and post-conflict situations, may increase women's vulnerability to violence. In 2014, 23 per cent of non-heterosexual women (those who identified their sexual orientation as lesbian, bisexual or other) interviewed in the European Union indicated having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by both male and female non-partner perpetrators, compared with five per cent of heterosexual women .Data from female participants of prevention interventions in six low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa show that women with disabilities are two to four times more likely to experience partner violence than those without disabilities. Furthermore, the risk of experiencing all forms of partner violence and non-partner sexual violence increases with the severity of impairment. Qualitative data shows that disability-related stigma and discrimination, compounds women's vulnerability to violence and hinders their ability to seek help.

However, boys are more likely to experience physical bullying than girls, and girls are more likely to experience psychological bullying, particularly being ignored or left out or subject to nasty rumours. Girls also report being made fun of because of how their face or body looks more frequently than boys. School-related gender-based violence is a major obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls.Twenty-three per cent of female undergraduate university students reported having experienced sexual assault or sexual misconduct in a survey across 27 universities in the United States in 2015. Rates of reporting to campus officials, law enforcement or others ranged from five to 28 per cent, depending on the specific type of behavior.One in 10 women in the European Union report having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15 (including having received unwanted, offensive sexually explicit emails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on social networking sites). The risk is highest among young women between 18 and 29 years of age.In a multi-country study from the Middle East and North Africa, between 40 and 60 per cent of women said they had ever experienced street-based sexual harassment (mainly sexual comments, stalking/following, or staring/ogling), and 31 per cent to 64 per cent of men said they had ever carried out such acts. Younger men, men with more education, and men who experienced violence as children were more likely to engage in street sexual harassment.Results from a national Australian survey show that almost two out of five women (39 per cent) aged 15 and older who have been in the workforce in the last five years have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace during that period, compared to one out of four (26 per cent) of their male counterparts. Regarding most common perpetrators, in almost 4 out of 5 cases (79 per cent) one or more of the perpetrators were male.Eighty-two per cent of women parliamentarians who participated in a study conducted by the Inter-parliamentary Union in 39 countries across 5 regions reported having experienced some form of psychological violence (remarks, gestures and images of a sexist or humiliating sexual nature made against them or threats and/or mobbing) while serving their terms. They cited social media as the main channel through which such psychological violence is perpetrated; nearly half of those surveyed (44 per cent) reported having received death, rape, assault or abduction threats towards them or their families. Sixty-five per cent had been subjected to sexist remarks, primarily by male colleagues in parliament and from opposing parties as well as their own.Measures to address violenceIn the majority of countries with available data, less than 40 per cent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort. Among women who do, most look to family and friends and very few look to formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than 10 per cent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police.At least 144 countries have passed laws on domestic violence, and 154 have laws on sexual harassment. However, even when laws exist, this does not mean they are always compliant with international standards and recommendations or implemented .Availability of data on violence against women has increased significantly in recent years. Since 1995, more than 100 countries have conducted at least one survey addressing the issue. More than 40 countries conducted at least two surveys in the period between 1995 and 2014, which means that, depending on the comparability of the surveys, changes over time could be analysed.Leaving no one behindEvidence suggests that certain characteristics of women, such as sexual orientation, disability status or ethnicity, and some contextual factors, such as humanitarian crises, including conflict and post-conflict situations, may increase womens vulnerability to violence. In 2014, 23 per cent of non-heterosexual women (those who identified their sexual orientation as lesbian, bisexual or other) interviewed in the European Union indicated having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by both male and female non-partner perpetrators, compared with five per cent of heterosexual women .Data from female participants of prevention interventions in six low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa show that women with disabilities are two to four times more likely to experience partner violence than those without disabilities. Furthermore, the risk of experiencing all forms of partner violence and non-partner sexual violence increases with the severity of impairment. Qualitative data shows that disability-related stigma and discrimination, compounds womens vulnerability to violence and hinders their ability to seek help.Source: http://www.unwomen.org",{},"['women', 'girls', 'countries', 'ending', 'cent', 'sexual', 'data', 'partner', 'men', 'experienced', 'violence']","Ending violence against womenIt is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner (not including sexual harassment) at some point in their lives. Women who have experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence report higher rates of depression, having an abortion and acquiring HIV, compared to women who have not. Younger men, men with more education, and men who experienced violence as children were more likely to engage in street sexual harassment. Furthermore, the risk of experiencing all forms of partner violence and non-partner sexual violence increases with the severity of impairment.

"Goodbye Banjul, India set to intensify relations with Africa",,,,,"Goodbye Banjul, India set to intensify relations with Africa ASHOK B SHARMA Published :Wednesday, 21 October, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 72 Indias engagement with Africa is set to enter a new phase with the hosting of the 5-day summit meeting with the leaders of the continent. The first summit level talk was held in 2008 in New Delhi and the second one was in 2011 at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Though the links between India and Africa are millennia old and New Delhi had supported continents struggle for independence and fight against apartheid, China could score the point on having more intensive engagement with the continent. Comparatively India-structured institutional engagement with Africa as a whole had a late start. But better late than never. Prime Minister Narendrabhai Damodardas Modi has rightly seized the opportunity for deepening relationships with Africa picking up the thread from 2008. What Prime Minister Modi intends is to give a new direction to Indias institutional relationship with Africa. The earlier Banjul formula of inviting only 15 heads of state or government through the African Union has been done away with. Now all the 54 heads of state and government have been invited to the 5-day Third India-Africa Summit scheduled towards the end of this month in New Delhi and almost all the African leaders have given their consent for participation, making it the largest international summit meeting to be hosted by India after 1983 NAM and CHOGM summits. This led Prime Minister Modi to tweet ""Level of engagement for @indiafrica2015"" has been tremendously scaled up. Turkey, Japan, European Union, China, South Korea and lately the United States have regular institutional arrangements with the natural resource-rich continent. Competition in engagement should not be a policy as in a multi-polar world there is enough space for every country to develop relationship suiting to its own convenience and to the needs of Africa. India, therefore, needs to develop its relationship with Africa in its own unique way. Since Banjul formula has been done away with, India needs to intensify its relationship with African countries through bilateral, regional and pan-African formats. There are several economic and political groups in the vast continent catering to regional interests and India needs to directly engage with these groups. At the same time we also need to maintain our relations with the African Union. So far, Indias development assistance was routed through the African Union. But the vast continent has countries with varied needs and priorities for development. Therefore it is necessary that India engage with these countries directly or through regional groups. Other venues of Indias engagement are Economic Commission for Africa, Afro-Asian Rural Development Organisation (AARO), Pan-African Parliament, Indian Ocean Rim Association. Recently South Africa hosted the 5th BRICS Summit with focus on partnership for development, integration and industrialisation of Africa. BRICS countries agreed to set up a Development Bank to meet the needs of developing and least developed countries in which countries can be beneficiaries. Indias basic approach to development cooperation is a three-pronged strategy --- technical assistance, line of credit (LoC) and grants. Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) was launched as early as in 1964 to share its development experiences with fellow developing countries, but then the continent of Africa as a whole was not much in the focus. To give focus to the countrys development cooperation programmes, a separate Development Partnership Administration (DPA) was set up in the External Affairs Ministry in January 2012. For promoting economic diplomacy Investment and Technology Promotion (ITP) Division was also created. Since the First India-Africa Summit, India committed $7.4 billion Line of Credit (LoC), out of which $6.8 billion have been approved and $3.5 billion has been disbursed which created 137 projects in 41 countries. Total grant element in the LoC was $500 million. Though the pace of capacity building and training has been satisfactory, that of setting up of projects and institutions has been slow due to the delay in preparation of detailed project reports (DPRs) by African countries. India, with the help of AU, could set up Pan-African e-network for education and health in 48 countries. Since the first summit, New Delhi extended 40,000 scholarships for pursuing their study in India. Indian pharma companies supplied cheap medicines to contain HIV/AIDS in Africa, but its role in containing Ebola outbreak was limited. It is an irony that while Africa seeks closer engagement with India New Delhis response has not kept up to that pace. There are 43 African Missions in New Delhi while India has set up permanent missions in only about 25 countries. There are some of the fastest growing economies in the world in Africa. It is a continent which has large amounts of arable land and rich in natural resources including oil and gas. It is a demographically young continent - 65 per cent of African population is under the age of 35. It has got a long coastline, very important in trade and strategic terms, of 26,000 km. There are, however, several landlocked countries. Africa has adopted 2,063 Agenda for sustainable development, good governance, rule of law, democracy, gender equity, renewable energy, sustainable fisheries. The United Nations adopted Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 with 17 goals and 169 targets. Will India be an active partner in Africas development? Can India be a leader of the developing world, including the land locked countries and small island states in the global fora, particularly in the context upcoming G-20 summit, Paris conference on climate change and WTO Ministerial in Nairobi? Africa represents 28 per cent of UN membership and its support is crucial for India getting a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. United Arab Emirates, Singapore, UN Coordinator for Africa, UN Global Head for HIV/AIDS and President of the African Development Bank are invited as special guests in the summit as they are interested in financing projects addressing health and social issues. Apart from development of the continent, there are areas of win-win situation for both sides. Bilateral trade has reached $70 billion and needs to scale up further. Indian corporates investment in the resource-rich continent is in the range of $30-35 billion. There is a 2.7 million Indian diaspora in Africa. There are ample scopes for setting up fertiliser plants in Africa with buyback arrangements. New Delhi depends upon import of pulses from countries like Tanzania to meet its shortages. Nigeria exports oil to India. Mozambique has huge gas potential and there are new hydrocarbon discoveries in North Africa including Somalia. About 400-strong business African delegation will be coming for the business forum meeting and trade ministers meeting is likely to sort out problems in trade and investment. Finally development can take place when there is peace and security. Africa is facing terrorist threats from Boko Haram and Al Shabab. India has joint working groups on counter-terrorism and defence training arrangements with several African countries which need to be extended to others. India is already in UN peacekeeping mission in Africa. Countries on the east coast of Africa are crucial for maritime security in the Indian Ocean and New Delhi has offered them a package of maritime security and sustainable blue economy. All wait for finalisation of the joint action plan with the African Union after the summit meeting which would pave the way for 2.3 billion people of India and Africa working together.

Before you donate blood,"Sir,Most people are not aware of the importance of donating blood. There are many advantages of donating blood that include the formation of new blood cells and a reduction in the chances of heart attack, liver failure, high blood pressure and blood sugar. It also helps in burning extra calories and assists in curtailing obesity. Moreover, the formation of new blood cells brings a glow to the skin.However, a donor should always be aware of some major points before donating blood. First, the blood donor should be a healthy person, aged 18 years and above and weighing more than 50 kilogrammes. Secondly, the standard quantity of a onetime blood donation should not exceed 470 millilitres. This is about eight per cent of the average volume of an adult's blood. The body replaces this volume within 24 to 48 hours, and replenishes red blood cells in 10 to 12 weeks. Thirdly, the donor should ensure that the needle and bag being used for drawing blood are sterilised. Further, after donating blood, the donor should take rest for at least five minutes and should drink at least one glass of juice. There should always be a gap of at least three months between each blood donation. Lastly, regular drinkers (alcoholics), drug addicts, pregnant women, people having diseases such as HIV or Hepatitis C should not donate blood.It is important to create awareness among the masses about blood donation as this helps in overcoming many misconceptions that people have in this regard.

BD achieves few MDGs indicators without required ODA,,,,,"Despite challenges, Bangladesh has been able to attain desired goals in few indicators of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including reduction of poverty rate and intensity, gender parity in primary and secondary education, controlling HIV and tuberculosis etc before the timeframe. Besides, the country has made significant progress in several indicators such as poverty reduction, children enrolment in primary education, weight deficiency of children, death rate of mothers, expansion of child vaccination and reduction of contagious disease. The achievement of the country has been reflected in a progress report, prepared by the General Economic Division (GED) of Planning Commission, which would be published tomorrow. Talking to BSS, Prof. Shamsul Alam, GED Member, said Bangladesh is the most advanced country in achieving MDGs and its achievement is more compared to any other countries. ""No country will attain all the goals before Bangladesh."" The report said Bangladesh needs US$ 78.2 billion to achieve all the indicators of MDGs (2011-15). The country requires US$ 5 billion and US$ 3 billion foreign assistances to attain general growth and higher growth annually. Analyzing the ""MDGs: Bangladesh Progress Report- 2013"" found that the country has received US$ 1.68 billion Official Development Assistance (ODA), which was very nominal against the required US$ 3 billion assistance annually for attaining the higher growth. In fiscal 2012-13, Bangladesh has been given a total of 48.24 per cent ODA, which proved that internal resources of the country have driven the achievement of MDGs. Apart from the significant achievements, some desired goals are not possible to attain by 2015. Not only Bangladesh, also all the countries would fail to achieve the indicators and those are: Providing employment to all eligible workforce, ensuring zero per cent drop out before completing class five, cent percent literacy rate between 15-24 age, improve the literacy rate to cent per cent of age 15 and above, women participation rate to 50 per cent in non- agriculture sector and increase forest area to 20 per cent with 70 per cent tree density. Bangladesh will advocate including those goals in the Post MDGs agenda. On the other hand, the report said the country should put more concentration to few sectors. They are: reduction of huger related poverty and increase employment, increase of the rate of conclusion of primary education and adult literacy, creation of more qualified employment opportunities for women, attendance of educated health worker during childbirth, awareness and available information about HIV/AIDS. ?BSS",{},"['billion', 'bd', 'mdgs', 'country', 'indicators', 'cent', 'reduction', 'required', 'bangladesh', 'rate', 'goals', 'achieves', 'oda', 'report']","Talking to BSS, Prof. Shamsul Alam, GED Member, said Bangladesh is the most advanced country in achieving MDGs and its achievement is more compared to any other countries.

India has the highest number of child marriages of any country, partly owing to the large size of its population, with 47 percent of girls married under 18 - around 24.6 million.",https://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=37886

He eventually lost the case, which put his career on hold for five years. ""It dented the armour in his career in America,"" said Michaels friend and former manager, David Austin, who produced the new Channel 4 documentary. ""He was a guy who was firing on all four cylinders and it just, it blew that candle out in the US without a doubt."" ""He says in the film, and when we were talking about the court case and how we were going to handle it, and I didnt realise this at all, but he turned around to me and said how he regretted it."" The Sony trial coincided with a devastating period in Michaels personal life, during which his partner Anselmo Feleppa discovered he was HIV positive and, later, died of an Aids-related brain haemorrhage. In the documentary, which Michael was working on 48 hours before his death last Christmas, the star reveals he never fully recovered from Feleppas death. He describes the Brazilian designer as his ""saviour"", who helped him feel comfortable about his sexuality.

Breastfeeding: the foundation of life,"Pregnancy and infancy are critically important periods for brain development for a child. Mothers and babies need good nutrition to lay the foundation for the child's future cognitive, motor and social skills, school success, and productivity.

Unsecured caesarean delivery rises alarmingly,"RAJSHAHI, June 30: Unsecured caesarean delivery across the country including Rajshahi is increasing alarmingly.According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), 15 pregnant women per day and 5,200 women per year die due to this caesarean delivery.According to information gathered by local civil surgeon's office in 2017, caesarean service has been provided to 4,910 mothers through different NGOs, private clinics and hospitals in different upazilas of Rajshahi. Of them, 13 newborns and six mothers died. On the other hand, there were 6,251 normal deliveries, but no mother died.About 80 per cent of caesarean sections happen at private hospitals and clinics. For a caesarean delivery, they charge up to Tk 15,000 to 50,000. Because of this, doctors advise for C-section in most cases.Initial study of Maternal Mortality and Health Care Survey (BMMS) in Bangladesh found that 196 mothers died in the C-section cases. At present, this caesarean delivery has become a cause of deep concern in the country.Women with caesarean surgeries experience excessive bleeding, more pain, and children born after 39 weeks may have respiratory problems. Also, if the mother wants to take another child then different complications arise and it can be risky.Preserved Child Health, Nutrition and HIV/AIDS Wing Director Dr Ishtiaq Mannan said, most caesarean delivery is unnecessary in Bangladesh. However, it is a serious problem in the village level, because there may not be experienced doctors. According to experts, it was used in the country as a strategy to reduce the birth rate. Caesarean is riskier than normal delivery and later many problems arise. C-section surgery is relatively painful. But private hospitals see the section as commercial for the sake of higher profits.

Alarming statistics of violence against women,,,,,"Alarming statistics of violence against women Womens Own Desk Published : Monday, 23 February, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 7 Womens Own Desk Violence against women is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women specifically because they are women. The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states that ""violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women"" and that ""violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."" Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, declared in a 2006 report posted on the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) website that ""violence against women and girls is a problem of pandemic proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her."" In order to realize the full scope of violence against women, it is necessary to consider some of its section parts. Each of these practices and all other forms of violence against women, are horrific as well as criminal and must be condemned. This is not an exhaustive list but a summary of the major types of violence against women. Rape: Rape is forced sexual assault, unwanted sexual intercourse. Rape knows no borders as it affects females in every country in the world. In contexts of war and conflict, rape is prevalent. Women are disproportionately the victims of rape, most commonly at the hands of men. In addition to psychological harm resulting from the act, rape may cause physical injury, or have additional effects on the victim, such as acquiring of a sexually transmitted infection or becoming pregnant. Sexual harassment: Sexual harassment is unwanted sexual contact or attempted rape. Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, in the home or within the community and should never be treated as anything less than a serious offense. Perpetrators may be family members or trusted members of the community, but this does not change the severity or danger of their actions. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence defines sexual harassment as: ""any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment . Not only girls, widow women are also a subject of harassment. A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as widow inheritance. On the other hand, sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches. Domestic violence: Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person in a domestic context against another, such as in marriage in the home within a family. Domestic violence can take a number of forms including physical, emotional, verbal, economic and sexual abuse. Globally, a wife is more commonly the victim of domestic violence. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, insufficient financial resources, fear, shame or to protect children. Dowry murder: Dowry murder is a practice in which a brides husband and/or in-laws kill her because her parents are unable to deliver the full amount or meet an increased demand of her dowry. It has also been reported that dowry demands have played and continued to play an important role in women being burned to death. Dowry murder is a brutal practice where a woman is killed by her husband or in-laws because her family cannot meet their demands for dowry a payment made to a womans in-laws upon her marriage as a gift to her new family. Acid violence: Acid violence is the deliberate use of acid to attack another human being. The victims of acid violence are overwhelmingly women, and attackers often target the head and face in order to maim, disfigure and blind. Acid assault survivors also face many mental health issues upon recovery. In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women. Forced marriage: A forced marriage is age in which one or both of the parties are married against their will. The customs of bride price and dowry that exist in many parts of the world contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is resolved by giving a female from one family to the other. Honor killing: Honor killing is another violence against women. It refers to the murder of women due to their perceived disgrace to the familys or communitys ""honour"" for things such as accused premarital sex, accused adultery, inappropriate behavior such as leaving the house without a male relative, and even rape. Preservation of honour is usually veiled in religious language, a dangerous manipulation of religion to justify an inexcusable practice. Women have been publicly stoned to death and burned. Violence during pregnancy: Violence before and during pregnancy has serious health consequences for both mother and child. It leads to high-risk pregnancies and pregnancy-related problems, including miscarriage, pre-term labour and low birth weight. According to Human rights organization Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) statistics in Bangladesh from January to December 2014 total 48 women were the victim of acid throwing, 13 cases of throwing attempt were failed and not mentioned cases are 18. As a victim of sexual harassment 241 women were harassed, not able to attending school for the fare of stalkers were 8 women, murdered due to protest 7 women and suicide for sexual harassment were 14. On the other hand, domestic violence victim were 488 women and failed case 261. Murdered by husband 262 women, murdered by husbands family member 79 women and 84 women committed suicide for domestic violence. Rape victim were 707, gang rape 208, death after rape 68, suicide 13 and attempt to rape 81. Dowry related violence were 296, failed case 139, death after psychical torture for dowry - 163 and suicide after psychical torture - 11 women. In 2014 World Health Organization says recent global prevalence figures indicate that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence. Globally, around 38 per cent of murders of women are committed by intimate partners. UN Women says according to a 2013 global review of available data, 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or some national violence studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime from an intimate partner. Trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. Women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labour worldwide, and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation. In the United States, 83 per cent of girls in grades 8 through 11 (aged 12 to 16) have experienced some form of sexual harassment in public schools. In New Delhi, a 2010 study found that 66 per cent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment between two and five times. Research conducted in different countries has documented associations between HIV and physical and/or sexual violence, both as a risk factor for HIV infection and as a potential consequence of being identified as living with HIV. A decade of cross-sectional research from African countries, including Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa and more recently, India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV. In the United States, 11.8 per cent of new HIV infections among women more than 20 years old during the previous year were attributed to intimate partner violence. High numbers of women report suffering violence since the age of 15: in Denmark 52 per cent, Finland 47 per cent, and Sweden 46 per cent of women say they have suffered physical or sexual violence. Studies were adjusted for differences in design and methodological quality. The highest rates of partner violence, estimated between 54per cent and 78 per cent, were found in central sub-Saharan Africa, but even high-income regions in Asia, North America and western Europe had rates above 15 per cent. These jump considerably when sexual non-partner violence is factored in. The studies still have gaps. For example, data about partner violence from central sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and southern Latin America, and for women over 49, were scarce. In addition, the studies did not assess emotional violence, and though estimates did not consider partners gender, most research studies solicited information only on male partners. In addition, many homicide reports do not include information about perpetrators relationships to their victims. Womens empowerment and awareness raising and community mobilization, including through media and social media are important component of an effective prevention strategy against women violence.

Women are disproportionately the victims of rape, most commonly at the hands of men. In addition to psychological harm resulting from the act, rape may cause physical injury, or have additional effects on the victim, such as acquiring of a sexually transmitted infection or becoming pregnant.Sexual harassment: Sexual harassment is unwanted sexual contact or attempted rape. Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, in the home or within the community and should never be treated as anything less than a serious offense. Perpetrators may be family members or trusted members of the community, but this does not change the severity or danger of their actions. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence defines sexual harassment as: ""any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment . Not only girls, widow women are also a subject of harassment. A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as widow inheritance. On the other hand, sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches.Domestic violence: Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person in a domestic context against another, such as in marriage in the home within a family. Domestic violence can take a number of forms including physical, emotional, verbal, economic and sexual abuse. Globally, a wife is more commonly the victim of domestic violence. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, insufficient financial resources, fear, shame or to protect children.Dowry murder: Dowry murder is a practice in which a brides husband and/or in-laws kill her because her parents are unable to deliver the full amount or meet an increased demand of her dowry. It has also been reported that dowry demands have played and continued to play an important role in women being burned to death. Dowry murder is a brutal practice where a woman is killed by her husband or in-laws because her family cannot meet their demands for dowry a payment made to a womans in-laws upon her marriage as a gift to her new family.Acid violence: Acid violence is the deliberate use of acid to attack another human being. The victims of acid violence are overwhelmingly women, and attackers often target the head and face in order to maim, disfigure and blind. Acid assault survivors also face many mental health issues upon recovery. In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women.Forced marriage: A forced marriage is age in which one or both of the parties are married against their will. The customs of bride price and dowry that exist in many parts of the world contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is resolved by giving a female from one family to the other.Honor killing: Honor killing is another violence against women. It refers to the murder of women due to their perceived disgrace to the familys or communitys ""honour"" for things such as accused premarital sex, accused adultery, inappropriate behavior such as leaving the house without a male relative, and even rape. Preservation of honour is usually veiled in religious language, a dangerous manipulation of religion to justify an inexcusable practice. Women have been publicly stoned to death and burned.Violence during pregnancy: Violence before and during pregnancy has serious health consequences for both mother and child. It leads to high-risk pregnancies and pregnancy-related problems, including miscarriage, pre-term labour and low birth weight.According to Human rights organization Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK) statistics in Bangladesh from January to December 2014 total 48 women were the victim of acid throwing, 13 cases of throwing attempt were failed and not mentioned cases are 18. As a victim of sexual harassment 241 women were harassed, not able to attending school for the fare of stalkers were 8 women, murdered due to protest 7 women and suicide for sexual harassment were 14. On the other hand, domestic violence victim were 488 women and failed case 261. Murdered by husband 262 women, murdered by husbands family member 79 women and 84 women committed suicide for domestic violence. Rape victim were 707, gang rape 208, death after rape 68, suicide 13 and attempt to rape 81. Dowry related violence were 296, failed case 139, death after psychical torture for dowry - 163 and suicide after psychical torture - 11 women.In 2014 World Health Organization says recent global prevalence figures indicate that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence. Globally, around 38 per cent of murders of women are committed by intimate partners.UN Women says according to a 2013 global review of available data, 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or some national violence studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime from an intimate partner.Trafficking ensnares millions of women and girls in modern-day slavery. Women and girls represent 55 per cent of the estimated 20.9 million victims of forced labour worldwide, and 98 per cent of the estimated 4.5 million forced into sexual exploitation.In the United States, 83 per cent of girls in grades 8 through 11 (aged 12 to 16) have experienced some form of sexual harassment in public schools.In New Delhi, a 2010 study found that 66 per cent of women reported experiencing sexual harassment between two and five times.Research conducted in different countries has documented associations between HIV and physical and/or sexual violence, both as a risk factor for HIV infection and as a potential consequence of being identified as living with HIV. A decade of cross-sectional research from African countries, including Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa and more recently, India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV.In the United States, 11.8 per cent of new HIV infections among women more than 20 years old during the previous year were attributed to intimate partner violence.High numbers of women report suffering violence since the age of 15: in Denmark 52 per cent, Finland 47 per cent, and Sweden 46 per cent of women say they have suffered physical or sexual violence.Studies were adjusted for differences in design and methodological quality. The highest rates of partner violence, estimated between 54per cent and 78 per cent, were found in central sub-Saharan Africa, but even high-income regions in Asia, North America and western Europe had rates above 15 per cent. These jump considerably when sexual non-partner violence is factored in.The studies still have gaps. For example, data about partner violence from central sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia, and southern Latin America, and for women over 49, were scarce. In addition, the studies did not assess emotional violence, and though estimates did not consider partners gender, most research studies solicited information only on male partners. In addition, many homicide reports do not include information about perpetrators relationships to their victims.Womens empowerment and awareness raising and community mobilization, including through media and social media are important component of an effective prevention strategy against women violence.",{},"['women', 'victim', 'domestic', 'dowry', 'physical', 'sexual', 'cent', 'rape', 'alarming', 'statistics', 'harassment', 'violence']","Alarming statistics of violence against women Women's Own Desk Published : Monday, 23 February, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 7Women's Own Desk Violence against women is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women.

Bangladeshi-Myanmar refugee marriages increase despite ban,"The number of marriages between Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi citizens has increased in the last one and half months, despite a government ban, apart from the health risk the Bangladeshi spouse is exposed to in such marriages. Already a couple of HIV/ AIDS infected Rohingya refugees have been identified in various refugee camps after they were forced to flee Myanmar following August 25 army operation in the Rakhain State. Most of the time Rohingya refugees tend to get married to a Bangladesh citizen in the hope of achieving citizenship. Realizing that the government on Wednesday issued a directive asking marriage registrars to check the nationality of the bride and bridegroom before registering marriages in Cox's Bazar, Rangamati, Bandarban and Chittagong districts.The measure was necessitated by the report of widespread flouting of the ban on marriages between Bangladeshi citizens and Myanmar refugees.

""A good number of marriages are taking place almost every day with the help of unscrupulous marriage registrars. The government is very much serious about stopping such weddings,"" he said. He also added that through the notification, they had asked the concerned marriage registrars to check the national identity cards to confirm nationality of the concerned men and women. ""Strong actions would be taken against marriage registrars for any negligence in this regard,"" the notification said. The Ministry also directed the marriage registrars of concerned districts to monitor the situation. It has been found that the guardians of Rohingya refugees are employing this strategy to get their daughters married off to Bangladeshi citizens so that they could stay in Bangladsh permanently. Abdul Quddus, a resident of nearby Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya, told this correspondent over phone that a significant number of girl child and adolescents are in various camps. ""They are under the constant threat of sexual abuse and trafficking. They also lack adequate food, shelter and sanitation. The parents are very worried about their safety. So if they find any opportunity to secure their daughters and sons future they give their consent without thinking twice,"" he said. It has been found that Rohingya parents do not hesitate to settle marriage of a young girl with an aged Bangladeshi man with a hope that they could stay here along with their family permanently.

Who will replace 'Daktar Bhai'?,,,,,"Who will replace Daktar Bhai? Abdul Matin Published :Thursday, 17 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 24 Albert Schweitzer was born in France but spent his life in Gabon in Africa. He built the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambarene, Gabon. It is an internationally acclaimed leading research hospital working to end the scourge of malaria and serving as a highly regarded training institute for African physicians and scientists. Albert Schweitzer received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952. Mother Teresa was born in what is now Macedonia but lived in Kolkata in India to serve humanity. She founded the Missionaries of Charity which is now active over 100 countries. They run hospitals and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis. They operate soup kitchens, dispensaries, orphanages and schools and render wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor. Mother Teresa was the recipient of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. Dr Edric Baker was born in New Zealand. He lived more than three decades in Tangail in Bangladesh, mostly in a remote village, serving humanity like Albert Schweitzer and Mother Teresa. He died there on September 1, 2015. His patients fondly used to call him Daktar Bhai meaning Brother Doctor. He obtained a degree in medicine in 1965 from Otego Medical College at Dunedin in New Zealand and took a government job. He served in war-ravaged Vietnam till 1975. Later he attended courses in child health in Australia and England. With his qualification and experience, he could have a comfortable and luxurious life anywhere in the world. Instead, he chose to come to Bangladesh in 1979 and joined a Christian mission hospital in Meherpur. Two years later, he joined Kumudini Hospital in Mirzapur and later a clinic run by the Church of Bangladesh at Thanarbaid of Madhupur. In order to provide better service to the local population he learned Bengali and soon became fluent in the language. In 1996, he set up the Kailakuri Health Care Centre where he spent the rest of his life. It is amazing to see how simply he lived at Kailakuri and rendered medical care to the local population. He left his mother, four brothers and two sisters in New Zealand and lived his life as a bachelor. He slept on the floor like his patients at the clinic and provided medical services to the patients while sitting on the floor, often wearing a lungi (a local dress of men). He started his clinic with a capital of Tk 10,000 only. Lately, he used to spend Tk 1,800,000 per month for the clinic --- collecting money from foreign donors. He charged Tk 5-10 as consultation fees from the patients and provided medicines to them even if they were unable to pay for them. He personally trained all the medical assistants working at the clinic, recruited mostly from the local population. He also used to advise his patients on healthcare. It is reported that he was not in good health for some time. He had had two surgeries recently. Because of his poor health, he was looking for a successor but nobody turned up to replace him. What will be the future of his clinic and that of thousands of his poor patients who used to receive medical treatment from him practically free? Bangladesh is no longer a country of the poor only. It has thousands of business tycoons for whom payment of Tk 2,000,000 per month to keep the clinic running is not a very big deal. Will someone among them or any charitable trust come forward to pay the monthly bill of the clinic? We have thousands of medical practitioners who have earned enough to live comfortably for the rest of their lives. Will someone volunteer to take charge of the clinic? Under no circumstances, the poor people of Kailakuri and the neighbouring region should be deprived of the treatment Daktar Bhai was providing to them. His was a rare example of dedication, sacrifice and service to humanity. How many people are there on this planet, who deprive them of the comfort of their homes and the love of their kith and kin to come to a country like Bangladesh to treat the poorest of the poor?

Another goal of the draft law is to protect people from communicable diseases and proper measures to create mass awareness about germs related diseases like Kala-Zar (fever), HIV Aids, Influenza, Nipah, Ebola, Anthrax, Avian Flu and Typhoid, he added. He said as per earlier directives of the Supreme Court that had declared all martial law regimes ordinances illegal, the draft law was placed before the Cabinet by translating the original law into Bangla as well as widening the area of its jurisdiction to cover all the contagious diseases. Under the proposed law, a patient or the affected person will have to be screened and isolated to protect common people from being affected, he said. Shafiul Alam said the affected person will also have to be examined in the related and specified institutes to detect the type of disease.

Egypt army backtracks on AIDS cure claims,,,,,"CAIRO, June 29 : The Egyptian military appears to have rowed back on claims that it has invented a ""miraculous"" cure for AIDS, HIV and hepatitis C, saying its devices will need a further six months of testing. The equipment, which had been due to be introduced in army hospitals nationwide from next month, were widely panned by scientific experts. Critics include former president Mansours own adviser, who said they appeared to have ""no scientific basis"". In February, major general Ibrahim Abdulatty, had presented what he called a ""miraculous scientific invention"" to a high level audience. A device called C-Fast was described as being able to detect illnesses including AIDS and hepatitis C. A related dialysis unit called ""complete cure device"" was also unveiled. But at a press conference on Saturday, a military representative said the devices required further testing, due to the limited sample size in its original trial. No members of the team responsible for the devices were reachable for comment on Saturday, and Abdulatty was conspicuously absent from the event. His bombastic announcement in February had been largely met with an embarrassed silence from Egyptian medical professionals, and was widely criticised as a propaganda feint intended to burnish the armys credentials as protectors of the nation. ?THE GUARDIAN",{},"['devices', 'military', 'backtracks', 'cure', 'egypt', 'hepatitis', 'aids', 'claims', 'army', 'called', 'device', 'scientific', 'miraculous', 'egyptian', 'widely']","CAIRO, June 29 : The Egyptian military appears to have rowed back on claims that it has invented a ""miraculous"" cure for AIDS, HIV and hepatitis C, saying its devices will need a further six months of testing.

Botswana's ruling Democratic Party wins general elections,,,,,"Botswanas ruling Democratic Party wins general elections Observer Online Desk Publish Date : 2014-10-26, Publish Time : 11:37, View Count : 10 The ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has won the general elections for the worlds largest diamond producer. It secured at least 33 of the 57 parliamentary seats being contested, the national electoral commission says. A party needs 29 seats to take power. Opposition group Umbrella for Democratic Change has won 14 seats. The BDP party of President Ian Khama has been in power since Botswana gained independence in 1966. But it has been battling to gain support in urban areas where opposition parties have made recent inroads. Botswana is seen as one of Africas most stable and democratic countries. Urban centres Three parties competed to win over the 824,000 registered voters who directly elected the 57 members of parliament. Vote counting is still under way. However, the Twitter account of Botswanas independent election commission said on Saturday that the BDP had already won 33 seats of the 57 contested, followed by the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) with 14. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) is in third place with just two seats. A further four members of the 63-member assembly will be chosen by the new parliament, with the president and the attorney general filling the remaining two seats. Preliminary results for local council elections also showed a strong showing for the two opposition parties in Botswanas urban centres, including the capital of Gaborone, Associated Press reports. Once elected, the MPs will then choose the leader. President Khama, the son of the countrys first president, is likely to get a second term in office. He has faced challenges in urban areas, amid a worsening economic climate. Despite being a middle-income country, Botswana continues to grapple with unequal distribution of wealth, high levels of poverty, unemployment and HIV, according to the African Development Bank. The unemployment rate stands at 17.8% and it has an HIV/Aids prevalence of 23.4%, it says. A survey this month by the research group Afrobarometer reported that 58% of people in Botswana considered unemployment the most important problem facing the country.

The rise in the number of private hospitals and clinics has worsened the situation.

Different transmission of vector-borne and pathogenic viruses and bacteria diseases could lead to an outbreak of infectious diseases. In the last few decades, the healthcare sector in Dhaka has witnessed an exponential growth. The city dwellers, however, claim that the quality of medical services is far from acceptable. Issues such as failure to dispose of waste and dust pollution, which are internationally recognized indicators, have put Dhaka at the very bottom of the Global livability index in recent consecutive years. Dr Lenin Chowdhury said the untreated medical wastes spread malodor and various diseases causing infectious diseases. ""All types of post-delivery products and syringes are very dangerous. The first one mixes with drinking water causing several deadly diseases. And using syringes could cause different severe diseases including HIV and AIDs,"" he said. The other thing is the disposal items. When dissolved it pollutes soil and that virtually becomes breeding place for other diseases, he said. Therefore, all medical wastes should be managed properly because it has been reported that medical waste poses an increasingly high risk for every creature. Asked what steps should be taken, he said proper waste management strategy should be devised to ensure health and environmental safety. Besides, training programme on safe handling of medical waste should also be organized for medical staff by hospitals so that these risks can be averted. Meanwhile, the High Court on Sunday asked the government to explain as to why directives will not be issued to set up medical waste processing plants in every administrative division of the country. Dr Abdul Matin, General Secretary of Bangldesh Paribesh Andolon, elaborating about the medical wastes said there are three types of medical wastes: general medical wastes like patients food, drinks, medicine, foils; sharp items like abandoned surgical instrument and knife; stitching items like needles and strings etc. But most dangerous items that cause pollution and pose serious threat to health are pus soaked gauze bandage, dressing materials, hand gloves, nasal pipes and respiratory pipes etc, he said. He also noted that in Dhaka city around 5000 tonnes of garbage are dumped daily where 200 tonnes are medical wastes. ""Medical Wastes should have different disposal systems but in reality it mostly does not happen. Most of the chambers, clinics and hospitals are not adopting this policy,"" he said. Suggesting about the collection of the medical wastes, he said medical wastes should be separated at the bed side area using three different bins and be disposed through three different channels, he said. ""But now all the wastes, general and medical, are being thrown into a same single municipal dustbin."" In developed countries, technologies like autoclaving and incineration are used for the final disposal of medical wastes. Dhaka City Corporation along with Prism Bangladesh, a non government organization, is working together to collect medical wastes. However, state-run organizations like Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartipakkha, Department of Environment, Department of Explosives, Fire Services and Civil Defense, Dhaka District Administration, Department of Environment and Dhaka Metropolitan Police are responsible for keeping Dhaka clean.",{},"['health', 'serious', 'wastes', 'waste', 'hospitals', 'different', 'pose', 'diseases', 'medical', 'items', 'dhaka', 'hazard']","Medical wastes thrown and dumped in front of every hospital are causing serious hazard to health of people, say experts.

"Cooperation in traditional medicines, health care a win-win for Africa and India",,,,,"Cooperation in traditional medicines, health care a win-win for Africa and India ASHOK B SHARMA Published :Thursday, 5 November, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 73 The African leaders have made abundantly clear that for the development of the continent they are open for cooperation with any country that would result in a win-win situation for both. Development of the continent can be possible if there is a greater flow of investment, setting up of industries that would lead to creation of more jobs and skill development, value addition to products for consumption and exports, development of infrastructure, cooperation in energy, particularly in renewable energy, education and human resources development, access to markets for trade, development of blue or ocean economy, modernization of agriculture, food security and access to affordable and quality healthcare and services. It is justifiable for a natural resource-rich continent that has been exploited by colonial powers over centuries, thereafter troubled by inter and intra-state conflicts and now by terrorism to look for partners who can ensure a win-win situation in the process. One significant area where Indias engagement with the continent has been a success story is in the field of affordable and quality healthcare and services. The Agenda 2063 adopted by the African Union clearly lays down ""every citizen will have full access to affordable and quality healthcare."" The crux of 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3 adopted by the UNGA and the Africa Agenda 2063, therefore, is the same - to ensure good health and wellness for all citizens. At home, India has similar ongoing programmes to ensure public health. India is the third largest supplier of pharmaceutical formulations and a major supplier of cheap and affordable generic drugs to Africa that has helped combat fatal diseases, like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. During the outbreak of devastating Ebola pandemic, New Delhi offered financial assistance that led to early detection of emerging dangerous pathogens like Ebola and Marburg viruses enabling more effective response. Two Indian scientists are among others in developing a vaccine to counter Ebola pandemic. While the recent Ebola pandemic surpassed all other outbreaks in terms of cases, deaths and geographic spread across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Lone, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) continue to plague the diverse African continent. According to WHO, fatalities on account of NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and cancer are likely to increase by 27 per cent over the next 10 years. Most of the NCDs are due to lifestyle problems. One major challenge before India is to resolve Africas problem of public health and ensuring food and nutritional security. New Delhis gift of Pan-African e-Network Project (PAENP) for tele-medicine and education covering 48 countries is unique in this respect. Through PAENP medical practitioners at the patient end locations in Africa can consult on-line with Indian medical specialists in various disciplines and specialties selected by the African Union for its member states. This network connects 53 remote hospitals, 53 learning centres, five regional universities and five regional hospitals throughout Africa. India has empanelled 12 super specialty hospitals and seven leading universities to provide expert domain knowledge in tele-medicine and tele-education. This project also helps African students to study medicine at seven universities in India. Continuing Medical Education (CME) classes are also conducted. India has installed diagnostic and pathology equipment in many African hospitals. Tele-medicine centres have been set up in four Regional Super Specialty Hospitals of Africa in Nigeria, Congo, Mauritius and Egypt. Indian pharma companies have invested in Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. Some of the major Indian pharmaceutical joint ventures or subsidiaries for manufacturing or trading in Africa are Cipla, Ranbaxy, Dr Reddys Laboratories, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, IPCA Laboratories, Parentearl Drugs, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Aubindo Pharma, JB Chemicals, Cadila Healthcare, Lupin and Intas Pharmaceuticals. Cipla has taken initiative in Cameroon, Kenya, Lesotho and Zambia. Indian hospitals, like Apollo group, are offering consultancy services to hospitals in Ghana, Nigeria and other West African countries. Appasamy Associates of India in joint venture with Vision Care Centre of Zambia launched Vision Care Appasamy Eye Hospital in Lusaka. Indian Embassy hosted free eye care camp in Addis Ababa in December, last year. Many patients from Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan, Mauritius, Egypt and South Africa come to India on medical tourism for treatment in specialty hospitals and receive treatment from traditional systems of medicines. India and Africa are enjoying cooperation in healthcare sector on win-win basis. It is time to strengthen it and extend the PAENP and healthcare system to include all African countries. PAENP should be extended to cover food and nutritional security and agriculture, particularly medicinal herbs cultivation and conservation. Africa is diverse with flora and fauna many of which have unique medicinal value. With a view to prevent bio-piracy and misappropriation of traditional knowledge, India has set up a Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL). Africa should do the same and allow bio-prospecting on the basis of benefit sharing with local communities. India has enacted Biological Diversity Act 2002 and has set up National Biodiversity Authority and state biodiversity boards to protect traditional knowledge and its ownership by local communities. India has launched Open Source Drug Discovery (OSDD) that works on the principle of open access to knowledge, expertise and resources in drug discovery involving a network of students, scientists from academia, industry and clinicians worldwide. OSDD coupled with Contract Research and Manufacturing Services are the mechanism for making new drugs cheaper and affordable. New Drugs Price Control Order 2013 and the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority in India make many life-saving drugs cheap and affordable. Besides, India uses flexibility under TRIPS regime to produce generic drugs at low costs. Thus, India can be Africas befitting partner in reducing its disease burden. But the use of traditional system of medicines would not only be cost effective but also preventive. India should assist Africa in its Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) for food security and cultivation of nutritional crops including medicinal herbs. Africa has ample scope for exporting and consuming organic produces. The African Union in its 2015 Summit symbolically consigned the use of hand-held hoes to the museum, so as to replace them with tillers and other modern technology that can improve productivity. Intensification of pulses cultivation in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria and Ethiopia can help India in meeting its shortage in this commodity and help Africa earn in foreign exchange. Similar can be the case of onion cultivation in Egypt, Burkina Faso, Cape Verdes, Central African Republic, Cameroon and Burundi. Morocco, Tanzania, Togo, Senegal, Algeria, South Africa have reserves of phosphate rocks while Congo Brazzaville and Ethiopia have potash reserves. Both phosphate and potash fertilizers are need for Indian agriculture. The Indian Prime Minister Narendrabhai Damodardass Modi at the recent Third India-Africa Forum Summit in New Delhi said ""we will also collaborate to develop Indian and African treasures of traditional knowledge and medicines."" Going by this assurance, one can hope that India-Africa cooperation in health sector would take a new dimension in making use of traditional systems of medicines that can not only be a preventive remedy but also cost effective.

For safer blood transfusions,"A blood transfusion involves taking blood from the donor and giving it to receiver. The blood goes through a tube from a bag to an intravenous (IV) catheter and into your vein. You may need a blood transfusion for a number of reasons, including:* to replace blood lost during major surgery, childbirth or a severe accident * to treat anemia that has failed to respond to other treatments; anemia is a condition where a person has low levels of red blood cells * to treat inherited blood disorders, such as thalassaemia or sickle cell anemia * An illness that causes bleeding, such as a bleeding ulcer.* An illness that destroys blood cells, such as hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia.* If you have an illness in which your bone marrow doesn't make enough blood, such as aplastic anemia, you may need transfusions.Is a blood transfusion safe?The risks of blood transfusions include transfusion reactions (immune-related reactions), non immune reactions, and infections. Blood transfusions are safe if donated blood is carefully tested and tracked. The aim is to reduce the risk of a person being given blood contaminated with a virus, such as hepatitis C & B, or receiving blood from a blood group that's unsuitable for them. Before making a blood donation, the potential donor is asked about their health, lifestyle and history.

80 upazilas lag behind MDG target,,,,,"Rafia Chowdhury Bangladesh will experience hiccups in a bid to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) as 80 upazilas are trailing behind and are in a state of deprivation. An assessment ""A Case for Geographic Targeting of Basic Social Services to Mitigate Inequalities in Bangladesh"" recently by United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) Bangladesh. Nearly 11 per cent of the country is related to deprivation and poverty, the study says. The assessment was made to determine the deprivation of education, health, water and sanitation, knowledge of HIV and AIDS, child mortality, attended at delivery, birth registration, early learning. The deprivation were considered along with 23 indicators are aligned to MDG indicators. Earlier assessment undertaken by UNICEF pointing towards income and expenditure poverty and geographic isolation as likely reasons to explain disparity between districts in their progress towards achieving MDGs. The study found serious disparities at upazilas level regarding progress towards achieving MDGs. Another reason mentioned for lagging behind in MDG goals was the geographic isolation of the 80 upazilas. The assessment recommends sector based holistic approach to be relieved of social deprivations by using a composite Deprivation Index by upazila. Such social development approach would have greater impact upon poverty reduction because of the synergy created by simultaneously addressing several social deprivation. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are commonly described as a ""roadmap for world development by 2015"". They embody the core content of the current development agenda of ""global governance"". They are treated as the current framework of international development cooperation, to which there would allegedly be no alternative. All countries and development agents have so far proven to comply with this framework, reasoning and operating ""inside the box"". The MDG framework will remain valid until at least 2015, the ""target date"" established for its implementation. Although not a legally binding instrument, nor even a formal UN resolution, the MDG framework has in practice acquired a politically and morally compelling character. South-west region of the country are relatively doing very well, according to the study. Five out of eleven best upazilas are located in Khulna and four in Barisal. Among a seven division Khulna does not have a single most deprived upazila. The people living in the upazilas, where most natural wetlands in Sylhet division are, mentioned to be deprived. The regions trailing behind the goal are in Chittagong and Sylhet divison . The areas habitated by ethinic communities in three districts Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban are the worst.",{},"['social', 'lag', 'upazilas', 'development', 'study', 'poverty', 'framework', 'goals', 'mdg', 'deprivation', 'assessment', '80', 'target']","Rafia ChowdhuryBangladesh will experience hiccups in a bid to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) as 80 upazilas are trailing behind and are in a state of deprivation.

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are eight international development goals that were established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, following the adoption of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. All 189 United Nations member states at the time (there are 193 currently) and at least 23 international organisations committed to help achieve the following MDGs by 2015. Out of eight MDS Bangladesh so far achieved successes in eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equity and empowering women, reducing child mortality and improving maternal health. ""I firmly believe Bangladesh will be able to achieve other goals of the MDGs from the period of 2015 to 2030. To gain the objective, we are more committed and more prepared,"" Muhith told the ceremony. Now, the people of the country are conscious more than any other time and they are marching towards development,"" the Finance Minister said while unveiling the report. The finance minister said: ""Our achievement is satisfactory and we hope the indicators that we are yet to attain will be realised by next phase."" The MDGs yet to be reached by Bangladesh are combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development. He said the country has been able to overcome the political instability in the journey of attaining the indicators. The United Nations Millennium Declaration 2000 marked a strong commitment to the right to development, to peace and security, to gender equality, to eradication of many dimensions of poverty and to sustainable human development. ""We know how to take the turnaround. Obviously Bangladesh will achieve the goals set for the least developed countries (LDCs)"", Minister said.

The necessity of mainstreaming the nutritionists,"Gradually, the common proverb",,2017-10-27,The Daily Observer,"Gradually, the common proverb ""Health is the key to all happiness"" is changing to ""Good health is the key to all happiness."" And our mouth is the prime cause of all. If mouth is under control then all are under control (health and peace). On July 20, 2017, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a notice addressing that doctors cant prescribe any types of food supplements. Good decision indeed! According to Breast-milk substitutes act 2013 including Breast-milk substitutes, infant foods (babies up to 6 months), commercially manufactured complementary foods (babies from 6 months to five years) and accessories none will print, exhibit, circulate or publish any advertisement. Thus, advertisement or telecast of these foods in mass media is a complete violation of the law. Sadly, several advertisements of different baby food items are frequently seen in television amongst which some of are very popular to people. Nowadays, baby foods advertisements are so unregulated that some advertisements even show that doctors prescribe these commercially manufactured foods for increasing height and brain development. In turn, these are pushing the mothers to feed artificial foods to babies ignoring natural foods. We know, for extremely premature babies, severely ill mothers, HIV positive mothers, breast cancer stricken mothers and some other cases, sometimes, it becomes urgent to feed formula milk to babies. But, the question is if necessity arises for such sad cases then who will take the responsibility of prescribing food supplements? Obviously nutritionist/dietician is the worthy and responsible person for this job. So, it should also be clearly added in this notice that the responsible professionals such as nutritionists will handle this issue. By this, they will be positioned to their right place and service taker will get proper nursing. On the other hand, nowadays, lifestyle diseases are increasing very alarmingly. Lifestyle diseases are associated with the way a person or group of people lives. This includes atherosclerosis, heart disease and stroke, obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and disease associated with smoking, alcohol and drug abuse. It seems rethinking time has come. Unhealthy and unwise lifestyle is becoming like a threat for us. In fact, like ""Medicine Dose"" it is becoming necessary to define and follow ""Food Dose"". It will make the people aware and help them to curtail the risks of lifestyle ailments. We know prevention is better than cure. Physicians generally serve the later stage that is ""curing"", which deals with patients. But satisfactorily they dont share the deserving time with patients to know about their history, to console them, to encourage them, and to make them understand the ways and benefits of prevention properly and clearly. The place of hope should not be so pale and rushed. But, there are ample food and nutrition graduates across the country from various universities namely DU, IU, JSTU, MBSTU, PSTU, and NSTU. So, in an immediate basis government should make a policy by mainstreaming nutrition that in every government hospitals at all tiers there will be appointed nutritionists who will prescribe food doses and make people aware about over dosing and low dosing, food consumption related complications, prevention through diet counselling, maintaining health through proper counselling, prevention of clinical symptoms, maternal and child health related issues, etc. Along with this all private hospitals must need to create position for nutritionists. In fact, Physician and Nutritionist should be like two side of the same coin. One who will visit a physician for aforementioned lifestyle related diseases will obviously visit a nutritionist, on a parallel visit. Health policy makers should adopt the ""Inter-professional Practice (IPP)"" mechanism to strengthen health systems and to improve health outcomes. Moreover, this will make the time shorter to feel the taste of middle-income nation and to facilitate achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good health and well-being. When peoples nutrition improves, heath care costs are driven down and human productivity increases. IPP occurs when multiple health workers from different professional backgrounds provide comprehensive service to families, patients, carers, and communities to deliver the highest quality of care. To implement this Government has to appoint enough nutritionists like BCS health cadres, for this post creation as ""food and nutrition cadre"" in BCS exam is obligatory. With this some others may be recruited by non-cadre examinations and privately by private hospitals and organizations. It will be like a complete health package and the motto will be ""working together for better health"". However, it seems sadly ""food and nutrition"" graduates are depriving from governments nursing and attention. Generally, ministry of health leads nutrition sector and implements projects on nutrition by miscellaneous professionals. But here food and nutrition graduates should get maximum priority. Moreover, Ministry of Food, that should be revised as ""Ministry of Food and Nutrition"". By this it will get its completeness in terms of efficiency and productivity.

Adolescent radio listeners' initiative launched,,,,,"Betar, UNICEF Team Up Adolescent radio listeners initiative launched Staff Correspondent Publish Date : 2014-11-26, Publish Time : 00:00, View Count : 10 Bangladesh Betar and UNICEF Bangladesh jointly launched ""Adolescent Radio Listeners Initiative"" on Tuesday to ensure access of adolescent girls and boys to information on facts for life messages. Speakers at the launching ceremony said that this project will create awareness among the adolescents about their rights and social norms congenial to their improved wellbeing. The initiative will create opportunities for the adolescent boys and girls to access information and to actively participate in the process of knowledge management. It will help them in sharing on major issues related to their development, including child marriage, child labour, corporal punishment, adolescent nutrition, puberty, HIV AIDS, hand washing, improved sanitation, safe water and reproductive health. Hasanul Haq Inu, Information Minister, inaugurated the initiative as Chief Guest. Nance Webber, Chief of Communication for Development Section, UNICEF Bangladesh, was the Special Guest at the launching ceremony. Most of the 29 million adolescents aged between 10 to 19 years are not aware of the facts for life and necessary information for their life skills. Three of ten adolescent girls get married at the age between 15 and 17 years. Only 57 per cent females below 20 years usually get services from physicians or nurses during pregnancy, the speakers said citing a recent survey. They also said that about 3.2 million children aged five to 17 are engaged in child labour. Among them 90 per cent are involved in informal and risky professions. Some 91 per cent school children have to bear physical torture in spite of ban on corporal punishment. At least 64 per cent of injury related deaths occur during 15-17 years of age. Everyday six adolescents take their own lives in Bangladesh. Under these circumstances, the country-wide Radio Listeners Clubs would help uphold the rights of adolescents and ensure a healthy life for them. Adolescents aged between 14 and 19, irrespective of caste and creeds as well as socio-economic status are eligible to be member of Radio Listeners Club named Koishorer Agrodut. Children with disabilities, street children and marginalized group members are given preference to be the member of the club. Besides, members of various adolescent groups, school brigades, Interactive Popular Theatre (IPT) groups, madrasa students, and existing members of radio listeners club are eligible to be members of Koishorer Agrodut Radio Listeners Club, speakers said.

"Poverty, child, maternal deaths high in India: UN report",,,,,"UNITED NATIONS, July 9: India continues to battle poverty, child and maternal deaths, according to a United Nations report on the Millennium Development Goals that said while several key global targets have been met, more sustained effort is needed to cover disparities by the 2015 deadline. The Millennium Development Goals Report 2014, launched by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon here on Monday, said many global MDG targets on reducing poverty, increasing access to improved drinking water sources, improving the lives of slum dwellers and achieving gender parity in primary schools have already been met. Many more goals are within reach by their 2015 target date, the report said, adding that if current trends continue, the world will surpass MDG targets on malaria, tuberculosis and access to HIV treatment. The report is the most up-to-date ""global scorecard"" on efforts to achieve the eight mostly anti-poverty goals agreed by world leaders at a UN summit in 2000. It, however, said that some MDG targets related to largely preventable problems with available solutions, such as reducing child and maternal mortality and increasing access to sanitation, are slipping away from achievement by 2015, despite major progress. ""We know that achievements have been uneven between goals, among and within regions and countries, and between population groups,"" Ban said, adding that unless imbalances are addressed through bolder and more focused interventions, some targets will not be met, including in key areas such as childbirth, maternal mortality, universal education, and environmental sustainability.

Illegal trade of human organ: Legal shortcomings,,,,,"World Kidney Day observed Illegal trade of human organ: Legal shortcomings Muhib Hasan Published :Thursday, 17 March, 2016, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 24 There is a menacing illegal trade of kidneys going on in many parts of the country. The main reason behind this is that in almost all the big cities, towns and districts, private hospitals, nursing homes or clinics have harvested up, which are involved in illegal organ trade, especially kidney transplantation. In Bangladesh the availability of medical transplants is lower than the requirement. The first kidney transplantation was taken place in Bangladesh in 1982. We need about 50 thousand kidneys whereas only five or even thousand kidney is available to the ailing patients. Therefore the illegal trade flourishes and there is an unholy nexus among the administration, police, private nursing home owners and a Section of doctors. They also appoint agents, who go to the poor, uneducated people in villages or towns and explain them about the benefits of selling organs. These poor people are made to believe that there are two kidneys in a body and even if they bestow away one, they can very well survive. Transplantation of Human Organs Act-1999 deals with human organs transplantation in Bangladesh. Section 3 of the Act authorize the transplantation of human organ, it says Any healthy and medically sound person can donate any of his human organs to his near relative ,if such transplantation does not impede his normal life. Except- Person under 18 years old, Person whose tissue is H.B.S.AG, anti H.C.V or H.I.V positive and person declared to be incompetent to donate by medical board under this Section. Section 9 prohibit Offering, advertising or any other commercial dealings of human organ while Section 10(1) imposes punishment for violation of its provision rigorous imprisonment not less than 3 years and not more than 7 years or with fine of 3 lakh taka or with both. And if the offender is medical practitioner with the above said punishment his registration shall also be cancelled, There is bad repute existing about some laws of Bangladesh being quixotic enough, this very Act is one of them. There are many lacunas in this Act frustrating the main purpose of enacting the same. Legal loopholes rather lead to illegal trade of human organs. These are- firstly, the present law regulates transplantation of only human organs. It needs to include tissues also. Secondly, the definition of `near relative is proposed to be expanded in order to include the grandparents and grandchildren as `near relative. There was no provision for grandparents and grandchildren. Thirdly, the very preamble of the ACT speaks about collection and conservation of human organs, but the provisions of the Act remains totally struck dumb about these important terms, namely how to collect? Who will collect? Where to reserve? Is there any national conservation center? These questions remain permanently unanswered. Section 7 only speaks about formation of medical board but what procedure to be followed in doing the same and what is the exact function of those govt-appointed physician are not clearly mentioned here. Fourthly, no provision of registration of medical centre, or university or collage for the purpose of transplantation work is there, which is urgent! Besides registration of donor and recipient it needs to put provision for the registration of such college or university or medical centre as well. Fifthly, who will take cognizance of this offence is not mentioned in this Act it only says that the procedure of criminal procedure ACT 1898 (V of 1898) shall be applicable regarding any offence under this Act. But this is not sufficient, as it appears to be such a poignant issue it should specify the actual authority who can take cognizance of this offence and which court shall entertain the case. In India in its respective Act -1994, Section 22 specifies that only Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under this Act. Sixthly, Section 11 of TOHO Act-1999 empowers the government to prescribe rules, but yet no rules have been framed, which is very much indispensable for actual enforcement of this Act. Seventhly, it needs to prescribe an appropriate authority that will grant permission of transplantation and examine the donor and recipient and take cognizance of offence, Lack of all these important issues makes the TOHO Act-1999 crippled. From both legal and ethical aspect commercial dealings of human organ is appalling. The victim of this bio -violence is poor Section of society, they remain always deprived. They are often trapped by a lucrative offer. They agree to donate (in real) to sell their organ, but when they are not paid, they cannot seek the assistant of law enforcers, as the total transaction and consideration were illegal, the was illegal, no contract was there. This is how this system prolonging the life of haves over the life of haves nots. They are illiterate, unaware Section of the society. They are misled, misunderstood, disconcerted. Poverty doffed away the clothes of general prudence from them leading them to such deadly transaction. One of the main culprits leading this unlucky Section of the society to such a dolorous life is TOHO Act-1999 itself. Before regulating transplantation of human organs, this law itself needs some legal -transplantation of important provisions first. Hopefully then we may stop this bio-violence.

World Heart Day and alternative treatment of heart diseases,,,,,"World Heart Day and alternative treatment of heart diseases Prof Dr Gobinda Chandra Das Published :Tuesday, 29 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 10 Devised by the World Heart Federation to help people realise that the majority of these deaths could be avoided, the day is part of an international campaign to spread awareness about heart diseases. Anxiety or mental uneasiness, aggression of emotion, excessive workload and miscellaneous burdens of life increase the risk of heart diseases. In daily life, continuous increase of demand, rush in work and daily stress in modern life directly affect the cardiovascular system of human body. If the heart is compared with a horse then the mind is its rider. So when mind increases the pace of run in life then naturally it increases pressure on mind and it puts impact on heart. Today, people are competing with the pace of time. Naturally, it is taking its toll. As a result, many are being affected by heart diseases. And without any forecast, at anytime it can snatch away mans life. A human needs food to live and when s/he suffers from any kind of diseases s/he needs proper treatment. Bypass and stenting are the two most notable processes of treatment of heart diseases. These are two kinds of surgery and are very expensive and risky, having many side-effects. Heart disease has been identified as the number one killer disease of the world. Every year 17.3 million people die of this disease. On the other hand, about 38 lakh people die of malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Even though these diseases are presented as more severe diseases than heart disease and the vast campaign about the alarming state of heart disease is absent. The theme of World Heart Day 2015 is creating heart healthy environments. The risk of heart diseases depends on ones lifestyle. Controlled body weight itself can reduce the risk of heart disease many times. To get rid of this silent killer we have to bring changes in our lifestyle. The world health conference has urged to take action plan by identifying heart diseases as one of the most dreadful non-contagious diseases and settling an objective of lowering the death rate caused by these diseases in 194 countries. We think the celebration World Heart Day will become successful only when the poor section of the country could be brought under the prevention and cure of heart diseases. Yoga is internationally recognised as the alternative treatment of heart disease and this alternative treatment is called holistic treatment. Holistic treatment is the tremendous combination of modern technology and ancient natural method. There are two main key factors of this treatment: Taking healthy diet and physical exercise. Daily food taking depends on patients age, state of disease and his present situation. And the matter about taking physical exercise is miscellaneous. Before all these, meditation in a proper method is needed to control the mind. Mental stress is the main cause of illness and unhappiness. To lessen mental pressure is very much important. It has also been said to collect the ray or life power from the cosmic power. To gain all these is not an easy task at all. For this, time is to be spent for regular exercise, obeying the rules properly. For Yoga, Pranayam, meditation and Neurobic Gym etc there are different sets of rules. In holistic treatment a programme is given to follow observing the soul, mind and body. In short it can be said that holistic treatment has gained peoples trust and has been playing a vital role in curing thousands of patients of heart diseases. Now, World Health Organization is giving emphasis on preventing and controlling heart diseases. In Bangladesh Holistic Health Care Centre is doing this job. In public sector this activities are being done in four steps: 1. Conducting awareness raising activities at school level to prevent heart disease; 2. Raising awareness among people, especially who are suffering from mental stress, high blood pressure or diabetes; 3. Providing holistic treatment to them who are already affected by heart diseases; and 4. Applying the alternative treatment process on them who are at the risk of blockage even after angioplasty or bypass surgery. Most people think if once block begins to build up in coronary artery it cannot be reversed. Its only treatment is angioplasty or bypass surgery. Millions of patients of our country, who spent much money in bypass surgery for the treatment or many are going abroad, again many are at the risk of being affected by heart diseases. But, following the holistic process they can get a disease free life. Its time to take some control over lifestyle for a safer future. Establishing control over lifestyle is difficult, but if it is done once then it will not be difficult for him later. As treatment for heart diseases is very much expensive, it is impossible for about 90 per cent people of the country to avail it. Most of the people of our country live in the villages. Communication system is not developed everywhere. As a result, patients die before they are admitted to hospital. Hence, it is imperative to prevent heart diseases by keeping our heart healthy and strong. On World Heart Day, we must listen to our hearts. We must look at our hearts carefully. To keep the heart diseases away we must try to do everything necessary. Besides, we have to create awareness about the alternative treatment of heart diseases along with the existing treatments. Prof Dr Gobinda Chandra Das is Director, Holistic Healthcare Centre, Dhaka. E-mail: World Heart Day is observed on 29 September in Bangladesh every year like elsewhere in the world. The day is a chance for people across the globe to take part in the worlds biggest intervention against cardiovascular diseases. The day focuses on creating healthy heart environments.Devised by the World Heart Federation to help people realise that the majority of these deaths could be avoided, the day is part of an international campaign to spread awareness about heart diseases.Anxiety or mental uneasiness, aggression of emotion, excessive workload and miscellaneous burdens of life increase the risk of heart diseases. In daily life, continuous increase of demand, rush in work and daily stress in modern life directly affect the cardiovascular system of human body. If the heart is compared with a horse then the mind is its rider. So when mind increases the pace of run in life then naturally it increases pressure on mind and it puts impact on heart. Today, people are competing with the pace of time. Naturally, it is taking its toll. As a result, many are being affected by heart diseases. And without any forecast, at anytime it can snatch away mans life.A human needs food to live and when s/he suffers from any kind of diseases s/he needs proper treatment. Bypass and stenting are the two most notable processes of treatment of heart diseases. These are two kinds of surgery and are very expensive and risky, having many side-effects. Heart disease has been identified as the number one killer disease of the world. Every year 17.3 million people die of this disease. On the other hand, about 38 lakh people die of malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Even though these diseases are presented as more severe diseases than heart disease and the vast campaign about the alarming state of heart disease is absent.The theme of World Heart Day 2015 is creating heart healthy environments.The risk of heart diseases depends on ones lifestyle. Controlled body weight itself can reduce the risk of heart disease many times. To get rid of this silent killer we have to bring changes in our lifestyle.The world health conference has urged to take action plan by identifying heart diseases as one of the most dreadful non-contagious diseases and settling an objective of lowering the death rate caused by these diseases in 194 countries. We think the celebration World Heart Day will become successful only when the poor section of the country could be brought under the prevention and cure of heart diseases.Yoga is internationally recognised as the alternative treatment of heart disease and this alternative treatment is called holistic treatment. Holistic treatment is the tremendous combination of modern technology and ancient natural method. There are two main key factors of this treatment: Taking healthy diet and physical exercise. Daily food taking depends on patients age, state of disease and his present situation. And the matter about taking physical exercise is miscellaneous. Before all these, meditation in a proper method is needed to control the mind. Mental stress is the main cause of illness and unhappiness. To lessen mental pressure is very much important. It has also been said to collect the ray or life power from the cosmic power. To gain all these is not an easy task at all.For this, time is to be spent for regular exercise, obeying the rules properly. For Yoga, Pranayam, meditation and Neurobic Gym etc there are different sets of rules. In holistic treatment a programme is given to follow observing the soul, mind and body. In short it can be said that holistic treatment has gained peoples trust and has been playing a vital role in curing thousands of patients of heart diseases. Now, World Health Organization is giving emphasis on preventing and controlling heart diseases.In Bangladesh Holistic Health Care Centre is doing this job. In public sector this activities are being done in four steps:1. Conducting awareness raising activities at school level to prevent heart disease;2. Raising awareness among people, especially who are suffering from mental stress, high blood pressure or diabetes;3. Providing holistic treatment to them who are already affected by heart diseases; and4. Applying the alternative treatment process on them who are at the risk of blockage even after angioplasty or bypass surgery.Most people think if once block begins to build up in coronary artery it cannot be reversed. Its only treatment is angioplasty or bypass surgery. Millions of patients of our country, who spent much money in bypass surgery for the treatment or many are going abroad, again many are at the risk of being affected by heart diseases. But, following the holistic process they can get a disease free life.Its time to take some control over lifestyle for a safer future. Establishing control over lifestyle is difficult, but if it is done once then it will not be difficult for him later. As treatment for heart diseases is very much expensive, it is impossible for about 90 per cent people of the country to avail it. Most of the people of our country live in the villages. Communication system is not developed everywhere. As a result, patients die before they are admitted to hospital. Hence, it is imperative to prevent heart diseases by keeping our heart healthy and strong.On World Heart Day, we must listen to our hearts. We must look at our hearts carefully. To keep the heart diseases away we must try to do everything necessary. Besides, we have to create awareness about the alternative treatment of heart diseases along with the existing treatments.Prof Dr Gobinda Chandra Das is Director, Holistic Healthcare Centre, Dhaka.E-mail: [email protected]",{},"['holistic', 'alternative', 'day', 'heart', 'disease', 'treatment', 'risk', 'mind', 'life', 'diseases', 'world']","World Heart Day and alternative treatment of heart diseases Prof Dr Gobinda Chandra Das Published :Tuesday, 29 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 10Devised by the World Heart Federation to help people realise that the majority of these deaths could be avoided, the day is part of an international campaign to spread awareness about heart diseases.

Growing breast milk banking network,,,,,"Growing breast milk banking network Publish Date : 2014-07-17, Publish Time : 16:43, View Count : 113 Two months before her due date, Gauri Meena gave birth to a baby boy at her village home in Indias desert state of Rajasthan. At 1.2kg (2.6lb), the baby was less than half the average weight of a normal Indian newborn and Ms Meena and her husband, Devilal, feared they would lose him. Taking advice from a local doctor, they wrapped their days-old son in a thick blanket last November and took him by bus to a government-run hospital in the nearest city 130km (80 miles) away. At the Maharana Bhopal General Hospital in Udaipur, doctors told the couple their child had a low survival rate. The infant, with his underdeveloped immune system, had contracted sepsis - a bacterial infection which can be life-threatening - and was given antibiotics as treatment. Doctors also told Ms Meena it was important the baby received mothers milk as it contained hormones and growth factors that would help him become stronger. Surplus milk The 22-year-old - malnourished and stressed - was not producing enough of her own. But thankfully, help was on hand. The first human milk bank in north India, according to the NGO operating it, has been offering for free since April last year what health experts have long described as ""liquid gold"". From its small, well-equipped clinic within the premises of the state-run hospital, the bank collects excess milk from mothers pre-screened for various diseases like HIV and hepatitis through a pump, which is then pooled, pasteurised and frozen ready to use for up to four months. The banks staff ask lactating women in the nearby area to give their surplus milk with the hope that they will persuade other mothers to donate. Over 660 women - agreeing to come at least once a week - have donated their milk since the bank opened, feeding more than 450 babies mostly kept in the Udaipur hospitals neonatal intensive care unit like Ms Meenas son. ""Hes recovering fast,"" said Ms Meenas husband six days after their infant first received donated milk through a tube. A month later, the family had returned home. Despite major inroads in reducing child mortality - from 2.3 million deaths of children under the age of five in 2001 to 1.4 million in 2012 - India still accounts for 20% of infant mortality globally. Over half of these deaths are of babies under 28 days old, according to a Lancet report published in May. Doctors say in India the main killers are infections and low birth weight that blight infants in their first month, and diarrhoea and pneumonia later on. Superfood for newborns To prevent these deaths, the charity Save the Children says breast milk, which it describes as superfood for newborns, is the most effective solution, particularly when a baby is breastfed immediately after birth and exclusively for the first six months. The World Health Organisation and Unicef agree - with both endorsing this advice. The Rajasthan clinic, called the Divya Mother Milk Bank, is run by an Udaipur-based NGO which in 2005 opened Mahesh Ashram, an orphanage for abandoned children in the city. Devendra Agrawal, a yoga guru who heads the NGO, noticed that the homes children, most of whom are girls in a country with a strong cultural preference for boys, suffered from low immunity. He realised it was because they were not receiving mothers milk. Most, but not all, of the banks milk is given to premature babies receiving care at the government-run hospital in Udaipur because of a limited supply. ""The first priority at the bank is to children at the hospital because they struggle with life and death. My children have immunity issues, but are not facing death,"" Mr Agrawal explains. The clinic, set up at a relatively small investment of around 1m rupees (£9,900;$16,000), is among only around 11 in India, its chief operations officer, Dr RK Agarwal, estimates. In the United Kingdom, where around 770,000 children are born each year compared to about 26 million births in India, there are 17. A few months after its opening, another bank was inaugurated in Calcutta with the backing of the local government. Two in Rajasthans largest city, Jaipur, are also expected to open by the end of this year. Health experts have welcomed this, but say there needs to be a bigger push by the authorities on breast milk banking. ""It is difficult because they dont believe that it would be of great benefit,"" said Dr Armida Fernandez, who opened Indias first milk bank at a hospital in Mumbai in 1989. Training postmen Arun Gupta, central coordinator of the Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India, a Delhi-based non-profit, believes milk banking can help tackle child mortality as long as it is part of a larger strategy to promote breastfeeding like the one adopted in Brazil. The South American nation today has more than 200 human milk banks - more than anywhere else in the world. As well as banks, Brazils strategy also includes innovative measures like training postmen to provide information on breastfeeding to pregnant women and using fire-fighters to collect surplus milk for donation from lactating women. This has contributed to the country achieving a 73% reduction in child deaths since 1990. Unicef says Brazils under-5 mortality rate is now 14 deaths for every 1,000 children. In India, the figure is four times higher at 56. ""Brazil is a very successful model not only because there are milk banks in every major hospital, but that their policy also includes training staff for better counselling,"" Dr Gupta said. ""Promoting breastfeeding is labour intensive. India lacks well-trained counsellors to educate women. We need one for every 1,000 women. Thats what I want to see."" For Dr Agarwal, the dream is bigger. ""Perhaps it wont be possible in my lifetime,"" says the 70-year old, ""but I want human milk powder to be available in grocery stores. ""I want it to reach that stage in India. Its so economical. When animal milk powder is available why not human milk powder?""

Malaysian MH17: Deep shock over Ukraine plane crash,,,,,"""Swift investigation needed"" Malaysian MH17: Deep shock over Ukraine plane crash Publish Date : 2014-07-18, Publish Time : 12:52, View Count : 117 World leaders demanded an international investigation into the shooting down of a Malaysian airliner over eastern Ukraine in which all 298 people on board were killed, a tragedy that could further heighten tensions between Russia and the West. Malaysias leader has called the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in eastern Ukraine ""deeply shocking"". Describing the disaster as a ""tragic day"" in a ""tragic year"" for Malaysia, Najib Razak said the investigation ""must not be hindered in any way"". The plane, carrying 298 people, crashed in rebel-held territory near the Russian border. Both sides in Ukraines civil conflict have accused the other of shooting it down with a missile. The Boeing 777, with the call sign MH17, was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It is the second disaster suffered by Malaysia Airlines this year. Flight MH370 disappeared en route from Malaysia to China in March and has still not been found. In a statement, Malaysia Airlines said MH17 was carrying at least 154 Dutch nationals, 27 Australians, 43 Malaysians (including 15 crew), 12 Indonesians and nine Britons. Other passengers came from Germany, Belgium, the Philippines and Canada, with the nationalities of 41 people not yet confirmed. Several of those on board - it is not yet clear how many - were heading for a major international conference on HIV/Aids in Melbourne, Australian officials said. Other airlines have announced they are now setting flight paths to avoid eastern Ukraine, while Ukraine authorities have declared the area a no-fly zone, according to European flight safety body Eurocontrol. Multiple reports from Washington cite unnamed US officials as saying they believe the plane, which had reportedly been flying at more than 30,000 feet (10,000m), must have been brought down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on the disaster on Friday morning in New York. Swift justice In his statement, the Malaysian leader said the planes route had been declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. He said the plane had not made a distress call. ""Malaysia is unable to verify the cause of this tragedy. But we must - and we will - find out precisely what happened to this flight,"" Mr Najib said. ""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice."" Malaysia is sending a team to Ukraine to help with the investigation. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said it was an ""act of terrorism"". Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told the BBC he had intercepted phone conversations that proved the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists. But Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the Ukraine government for restarting military operations in the area, where it is trying to regain control from pro-Russian rebels. ""The country in whose airspace this happened bears responsibility for it,"" he said. Separatist leader Alexander Borodai, meanwhile, accused the Ukrainian government of bringing down the airliner. In a telephone conversation, US President Barack Obama and the Dutch leader, Mark Rutte, ""agreed on the need to assure immediate access to the site... to international investigators... to carry out a thorough investigation"", the White House said. A subsequent White House statement said it was ""critical that there be a full, credible and unimpeded international investigation as quickly as possible"". World leaders demanded an international investigation One US official said Washington strongly suspected a surface-to-air missile that downed the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday was fired by Ukrainian separatists backed by Moscow. There was no evidence Ukrainian government forces fired a missile, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. US Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Detroit, said the passenger jet was apparently ""blown out of the sky"". Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott appeared to go further than other Western leaders in apportioning blame, demanding on Friday that Moscow answer questions about the ""Russian-backed rebels"" that he said were behind the disaster. More than 20 Australians were among the many nationalities aboard Flight MH17. The Netherlands was the worst affected, with 154 Dutch citizens on the downed plane. The plane crashed near the village of Hrabove about 40 km (25 miles) from the border with Russia near the regional capital of Donetsk, an area that is a stronghold of rebels who have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for several months. Ukraine accused pro-Moscow militants, aided by Russian military intelligence officers, of firing a long-range, Soviet-era SA-11 ground-to-air missile. Leaders of the rebel Donetsk Peoples Republic denied any involvement and said a Ukrainian air force jet had brought down the intercontinental flight. Russian President Vladimir Putin - at loggerheads with the West over his policies toward Ukraine - pinned the blame on Kiev for renewing its offensive against rebels two weeks ago after a ceasefire failed to hold. The Kremlin leader called it a ""tragedy"" but did not say who brought the Boeing 777 down. Mistake or terrorism The plane fell between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk. The head of the Russian Air Traffic Controllers Union, Sergei Kovalyov, told BBC Russian that the airspace over eastern Ukraine had remained open during the conflict because the planes previously shot down had tended to be helicopters or low-flying fast jets. ""In order to bring down an airplane from an altitude of 10,000m, you need to have very serious weapons…. missiles,"" he said. ""Its either a mistake or a terrorist act."" Game-changer in Ukraine crisis? Ukraine has accused Russias military of supplying advanced missiles to the rebels. Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials blamed the Russian air force for shooting down one of its ground attack jets on Wednesday, and a transport plane on Monday. In 2001, Ukraine admitted its military was probably responsible for shooting down a Russian airliner that crashed into the Black Sea, killing all 78 people on board.

Tobacco hurts more than just your lungs -- it damages the communities that grow it,"The Kipembawe Division is hidden in the southern highlands of south-west Tanzania, a long seven-hour drive north from the city of Mbeya. The scenery is stunning, yet when you look closer you can see that tobacco plants dominate agricultural areas, and the sound of trees being felled is a constant background noise.Just the word",,,The Daily Observer,"The Kipembawe Division is hidden in the southern highlands of south-west Tanzania, a long seven-hour drive north from the city of Mbeya. The scenery is stunning, yet when you look closer you can see that tobacco plants dominate agricultural areas, and the sound of trees being felled is a constant background noise. Just the word ""tobacco"" conjures up vivid imagery of death and disease, as depicted on graphic cigarette packets and through hard-hitting anti-smoking campaigns. But tobaccos impact starts long before it is found wrapped in a cigarette, and affects many more people than the estimated one billion smokers worldwide. Tobacco also impacts the health and well-being of the people who grow it and the environment where it is grown, often with devastating consequences. My colleagues and I have recently published research demonstrating just how damaging it can be to the environment and communities in rural Tanzania. Most villages in Kipembawe dont have electricity or mobile phone coverage. There are minimal healthcare facilities, and water is obtained from wells and rivers. There are few crops people can grow to make money and the dominant one is tobacco, farmed by 86 per cent of the 196 households we surveyed. In Tanzania, 47 per cent of the population lives below the international poverty line and rural poverty rates are even higher, where most people are reliant on agriculture. In Africa, tobacco cultivation is often associated with the presence of a dry tropical woodland called ""miombo"", which dominates Kipembawe. Miombo woodland covers over 2.4m km in Africa, but is undergoing rapid deforestation and degradation throughout its range. Both tobacco and miombo trees like sandy, slightly acidic soils. Unfortunately, these soils dont contain many nutrients, and tobacco is one of the most nutrient-hungry crops there is. This means farmers must clear more woodland almost every year to create new fields, because the land can only support one or two cropping cycles. For tobacco leaves to be preserved for transportation and further processing they must be dried or cured. This places another burden on the trees, which are used for fuel. In total, approximately 4,134 hectares of woodland are cleared annually within Kipembawe. This reduces biodiversity and the benefits the local environment can provide people, including carbon storage, firewood, building materials and fresh water. Risks to farmers: But woodland clearance is just the start of the process. Throughout the growing season, farmers apply several rounds of fertiliser and pesticides to the crop, yet few farmers understand the risks associated with their use. During our time in Kipembawe, we didnt see anyone using protective clothing or equipment, exposing farmers, families and labourers to harmful chemicals. Whats more, despite regulations that aim to reduce the impact of fertilisers on water sources, the crops are often initially grown close to rivers so that the distance to carry water is shorter. This means the only source of drinking water for livestock can become contaminated, causing conflict between livestock keepers and tobacco farmers. Child labour within tobacco growing is a also well-known issue, and the main tobacco organisations have joined the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation. But we saw children working in the fields, and evidence from primary schools indicates that children are likely to start working on their parents fields from around the age of 13. While this has obvious consequences for their education, there are also severe health impacts. Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that occurs when the tobacco leaves are wet and contact the skin. Nicotine is absorbed through the skin, and leads to fever, vomiting and dizziness. While it rarely results in death it can be extremely frightening to children, who are more susceptible to severe symptoms due to a lack of nicotine tolerance and smaller body size. Little other choice: So why do farmers grow tobacco? Many people have few alternative ways to make a living and farmers can get a good price for top quality tobacco. This money can significantly improve the lives of the farmers, enabling them to pay school fees, invest in other businesses, and afford bicycles and solar electricity. Some men spend their money during the weeks after harvest drinking in the local pubs and pop-up bars which emerge. Canny women brew home beer from maize, and make a roaring trade. But prostitutes also flock to the area around this time, raising the risk of STI transmission. HIV rates in Mbeya are the third highest in the country, with nine per cent of 15-49 year olds testing positive for HIV - four per cent higher than the national average. Despite the 2005 World Health Organisations Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and falling smoking rates, global population growth means total tobacco use looks likely to keep rising in the foreseeable future. But in Kipembawe, the deforestation associated with tobacco cultivation will ultimately make production unviable because there will be no fuel left to cure the crop. This will leave the community without a significant source of income and a degraded environment. If people had other ways to make their living, it would help reduce the social and environmental burdens of tobacco production, but opportunities are limited. Tobacco production could be made more sustainable using alternative drying methods, reforestation, more efficient use of fertilisers and pesticides and land use management plans. But extensive training and support is needed, and child labour must be eliminated. All of this will be difficult while there is such great demand for tobacco. So next time you think about lighting up, remember its not just your health at risk. Kicking the habit could save both trees and childrens chances.

Dealing with child mortality problem,"Child mortality, also known as child death, refers to the death of children under the age of 14 and encompasses neonatal mortality, under-5 mortality, and mortality of children aged 5-14. Many child deaths go unreported for a variety of reasons, including lack of death registration and lack of data on child migrants. Without accurate data on child deaths, we cannot fully discover and combat the greatest risks to a child's life. Child mortality is a big deal, and a lot of people are fighting to reduce it in the developing world. In fact, the number of children younger than 5 who die each year from preventable causes has decreased dramatically - from 12.7 million in 1990 to 5.9 million in 2015. But that's not fast enough, per the World Health Organization and other development agencies.But progress in meeting this Millennium Goal is the most off track of any. In 2002, 7 of every 1,000 children in industrialized countries died before they were five. In South Asia, 97 of 1,000 children died before they were five. And in sub-Saharan Africa, that number is 174 of every 1,000 children. Ninety countries, 53 of them from developing nations, should be able to meet the 2015 Goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds, if they maintain their current annual reduction rate. But 91 developing countries lag far behind. Many have seen mortality rates rise since 1990, countries from sub-Saharan Africa as well as Iraq and former members of the Soviet Union.The number of children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS is projected to reach 25 million by the end of the decade, 18 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa. This, along with only modest progress fighting malaria, means the threats facing child survival are as grave as ever. About 29,000 children under the age of five - 21 each minute - die every day, mainly from preventable causes. More than 70 per cent of almost 11 million child deaths every year are attributable to six causes: diarrhea, malaria, neonatal infection, pneumonia, preterm delivery, or lack of oxygen at birth.These deaths occur mainly in the developing world. An Ethiopian child is 30 times more likely to die by his or her fifth birthday than a child in Western Europe. Among deaths in children, South-central Asia has the highest number of neonatal deaths, while sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates. Two-thirds of deaths occur in just 10 countries. And the majorities are preventable. Some of the deaths occur from illnesses like measles, malaria or tetanus. Others result indirectly from marginalization, conflict and HIV/AIDS. Malnutrition and the lack of safe water and sanitation contribute to half of all these children's deaths. But disease isn't inevitable, nor do children with these diseases need to die. Research and experience show that six million of the almost 11 million children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as vaccines, antibiotics, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets and improved family care and breastfeeding practices.Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable. Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as vaccines, antibiotics, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and breastfeeding practices, and oral rehydration therapy. Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality.In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent. Proven, cost-effective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year. Still, low-cost immunization interventions do not reach 30 million children, despite success in immunizations in reducing polio, tetanus, and measles. Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year. Vitamin A supplementation costs only $0.02 cents for each capsule and given 2-3 times a year will prevent blindness and death. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 12 to 24 per cent, only 70 per cent of targeted children were reached in 2015. Between 250,000 and 500,000 children become blind every year, with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is an effective treatment for lost liquids through diarrhea; yet only 4 in 10 (44 per cent) of children ill with diarrhea are treated with ORT.Essential newborn care including immunizing mothers against tetanus, ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment, drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth, providing necessary warmth, and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment of infections with antibiotics - could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually. Improved sanitation and access to clean drinking water can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea. Over 30% of the world's population does not have access to basic sanitation, and 844 million people use unsafe sources of drinking water. About 80 per cent of health care in developing countries occurs in the home - and the majority of children who die do so at home, without being seen by a health worker. Meanwhile, proper infant feeding and breast feeding are still not practiced by many families. As many as 40 per cent of child deaths could be prevented with improved family and community care - not high-tech health equipment, but access to solid knowledge, support and basic supplies. Ending preventable child deaths can be achieved by providing immediate and exclusive breastfeeding, improving access to skilled health professionals for antenatal, birth, and postnatal care, improving access to nutrition and micronutrients, promoting knowledge of danger signs among family members, improving access to water, sanitation, and hygiene and providing immunizations.

Youth declaration for SDGs,,,,,"Youth declaration for SDGs Khalid Yahyea Published :Friday, 18 September, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 33 Although remarkable progress and unprecedented levels of global attention and effort were seen in the last couple of years, the United Nations (UN) along with its member states and wider international community, was not able to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets since their introduction in 2000. As a consequence, the UN announced setting a new agenda towards the end of 2015 substituting the MDGs with a post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework. The eight MDGs along with other 21 targets and 60 indicators were set by the UN in 2000 to be achieved by 2015, taking 1990 as the base year to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, achieve primary education, promote gender equality and empower women, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensure environmental sustainability and develop global partnership for the development. Although the MDGs were unquestionably well-intentioned, the needs and skills of youths as well as their empowerment were omitted in the framework, and thus the MDGs failed to recognize youths as strategic actors in the solution matrix. As the international community prepares itself for the launch of the Post 2015 goals, it is important that youth are included as equal partners in the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the framework. A total of 75selected influential youth delegates representing 32 countries covering every part of the world gathered in Seoul and Goesan of Korea to discuss the role of the youths in contributing to the realization of the MDGs and the Post 2015 SDGs. The 26th International Youth Forum was hosted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, the Republic of Korea (MOGEF), and organized by the National Council of Youth Organizations in Korea (NCYOK) recently. The main theme was Youth in MDGs and Post 2015 and sub-themes were Global Youth Perspective on Millennium Development Goal and Global Youths Contributions for Sustainable Development Goals. The forum included keynote lectures, country case presentations, inter-group discussions, council debate, open forum, plenary session, Korean traditional culture experience, practical music lessons, outdoor activities, cultural night, certificates distribution and, finally, the youth declaration. The conference put emphasis on making the youths more aware of global issues to tackle them and find alternative ways or solutions, improving cooperation and mutual understanding among youths across diverse cultures, spreading goodwill around the world and building interactive global citizenship through networking among youths. Remembering the commitment of the UN and its member states to recognize the youth as an integral part in the development of the Post 2015 Agenda, youth should be highly considered a strategic capacity building partner that is allowed to assume responsibilities in political, economic, and social domains in their countries and communities.

"Post-MDG framework, Experts for addressing growing rich-poor gap",,,,,"With the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set to expire by 2015, experts in Bangladesh have laid emphasis on addressing the growing inequality between the poor and the rich in the post-2015 framework. The MDGs were established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000 to achieve eight goals by 2015. While setting the MDGs, global problems prevailing at that time were considered and eight goals such as eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development were taken up. The experts here now feel some key challenges were not reflected in the MDGs such as ensuring inclusive growth and employment creation, tackling climate change and achieving sustainable development. Meanwhile, as part of contributions to the global dialogue on the post -2015 agenda, based on Bangladeshs experience, a total of 13 goals have been formulated, with suggested targets and indicators. Among those, Goal no 1 suggests securing economic growth that is inclusive, reducing poverty and inequality, and creating sufficient numbers of decent jobs. Goal 2 speaks of ensuring sustainable food security and good nutrition, goal 3 includes reducing social inequality, particularly among marginalized groups and improving living condition, goal no 4 suggests achieving equality between women and men. The Chairman of the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSP), Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, said, ""The developed countries since 2010-2012 are talking about compensation for climate change, amounting to $ 30 million but they have not paid it yet."" He also noted that to reach the MDGs people belonging to disadvantaged communities such as dalit, tea garden and Haor workers and marginal farmers should be integrated with the mainstream development. Referring to the present allocation in the budget, he said that only an amount of TK.14 crore has been allocated for about 65 lakh dalit people across the country. Emphasizing structural causes that create poverty and inequality, Dr. Rashed Al Mahmud Titumir, Associate Professor of Economics, Department of Development Studies, University of Dhaka, emphasized creation of employment and ensuring justice for all in the post- 2015 development framework. Ahmed Swapan Mahmud, Executive Director of the Voice, a rights based organization, said remarkable progress has been made in some of the MDGs, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction, gender parity in education, maternal mortality, child mortality and combating HIV/AIDS and other major diseases. ""However, much remains to be addressed in the areas of nutrition, maternal health, environmental sustainability and growing inequalities based on geography, groups, particularly gender,"" he added. A.S.M Badrul Alam, President of Bangladsh Krishak Federation, laid stress on small scale and agro- ecological farming.

Evaluation of the achievement of MDGs,,,,,"The General Economic Division of the Planning Commission has revealed that though Bangladeshs achievement in five Millennium Development Goal areas is remarkable in three other areas it may not achieve full success. In the areas where full success will not be achieved are eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement of universal primary education, gender equality and empowerment women. All MDG goals set by the United Nations Organisation (UNO) were products of far-sighted thoughts of economic thinkers and development planners especially in the context of developing and under developed countries. The MDG time frame will expire in 2015; countries that were down to earth with the programme are now busy to assess their areas of success and the areas which still remain to be fulfilled. Out of the eight MDGs Bangladeshs achievement in poverty alleviation, infant mortality, maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability and developing global partnership for development are note worthy. In other three areas namely eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education and achieving gender equality and empowerment of women shall not be fully achieved. Speaking realistically, the areas which shall remain unfulfilled are enormously important and all agencies of the government should have focused their attentions towards them. One positive thing is that the MDG time frame has another one year and a quarter and all out effort will definitely help reaching nearer to the achievement line. Now it is for all of the concerned agencies and individuals of the government to double the speed of their march forward. Non-fulfilment in these three areas shall affect the country adversely especially in view of the national target of reaching a middle income level by 2021. Extreme poverty is painful and is a shame for any country and in none of the even moderately developed civilised countries there is a group of people who are so poor that they do not have food to eat, place to live and no medical support during ailment. In ultimate analysis it will come that extreme poverty is against human rights and it is inhuman as well. According to an UNDP and Bangladesh Central Bank joint statistics out of nearly nine crore eligible workers of Bangladesh three and a half crore are out of employment which is appalling and we, at all level, must be ever vigilant of that. A portion of the unemployed people is extreme poor and hungry and hence it should be our utmost endeavour to wither these human miseries.",{},"['women', 'evaluation', 'achievement', 'mdgs', 'development', 'countries', 'poverty', 'extreme', 'areas', 'shall', 'mdg', 'success']","In the areas where full success will not be achieved are eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, achievement of universal primary education, gender equality and empowerment women. Out of the eight MDGs Bangladesh's achievement in poverty alleviation, infant mortality, maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental sustainability and developing global partnership for development are note worthy. In other three areas namely eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education and achieving gender equality and empowerment of women shall not be fully achieved.

Depression: Risk and prevention,,,,,"Depression: Risk and prevention Dr Nazma Akter Published : Wednesday, 17 December, 2014, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 6 Depression is a serious condition that involves your body, mood and thoughts. It can affect the way you eat and sleep, the way you feel about yourself, and the way you think about things. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people who suffer from depression. People with depression may not recognize that they have a treatable disorder or they may be discouraged from seeking or staying with treatment due to feelings of shame and the associated stigma. Too often, untreated or inadequately treated depression is associated with suicide. Although depression can affect anyone, women are more likely to have depression than men. Any type of depression may run in families, suggesting that a biological vulnerability can be inherited. Depression can also occur in people who have no family history of the condition. Additional factors, such as stress at home, work, or school, may trigger depression. Whether inherited or not, depression is often associated with an imbalance in certain brain chemicals. Very often, a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors is involved in the onset of a depressive disorder. Depression may also result from having a chronic physical illness or from taking or misusing certain medicines or drugs. In people who have suffered a previous episode of depression, another episode may be precipitated by very little or no stress. Symptoms Symptoms of depression vary a great deal from person to person. Some people have only a few symptoms, while others have many. Symptoms can change over time and may include: l Persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness. l Feeling guilty, worthless, or helpless. l Loss of interest in hobbies and activities. l Loss of interest in sex. l Feeling tired. l Trouble concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. l Trouble sleeping, waking up too early, or oversleeping. l Eating more or less than usual. l Weight gain or weight loss. l Restlessness, irritability, or anxiety. l Physical symptoms that defy standard diagnosis and do not respond well to medical treatments. l Thoughts of death or suicide (with or without suicide attempts). Associated conditions Depression often coexists with other conditions. Disorders commonly associated with depression include: l Heart disease l Neurological disorders, including: w Stroke w Parkinsons disease w Multiple sclerosis w Head injury w Dementia l Obesity l Chronic insomnia l Some forms of cancer, including breast cancer l HIV/AIDS l Diabetes l Thyroid disorders ( hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism ) l Mental decline (in the elderly) l Chronic pain l Mental disorders such as: w Anxiety disorders w Alcohol abuse w Drug abuse w Certain personality disorders Diagnosis Your doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history.

However, the more risk factors you have, the greater your likelihood of developing depression. If you have a number of risk factors, ask your healthcare provider what you can do to reduce your risk. Your risk of depression may be related to a combination of genetic, physical, psychological, and environmental factors. These include: l Family History of Mental Illness l People with a family history of depressive disorders tend to be at increased risk of developing depression. l Chronic Physical or Mental Disorders l Medical illnesses such as stroke , heart attack , cancer , HIV/AIDS , Parkinsons disease , and hormonal disorders can increase the risk of depression. Chronic pain is known to be associated with depression. l A history of one or more previous episodes of depression significantly increases the risk of a subsequent episode. l Major Life Changes and Stress. A stressful change in life can trigger a depressive episode. Such stressful events may include a serious loss, a difficult relationship, trauma, or financial problems. l Little or No Social Support. l Psychological Factors- Certain psychological factors put people at risk for depression.

Prioritising Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) during emergencies,,,,,"Prioritising Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) during emergencies Anjali Sen Published :Saturday, 15 August, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM View Count : 11 What happens when a natural disaster, like flood, strikes? Houses are inundated, livelihoods lost, families lost, women and children separated?horror strikes from all sides. And what comes to our mind when we talk about relief during disasters? - Food? Water? Shelter? What about Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH)? Do we give it enough thought?if not, then it is high time we did! Women, young girls and boys are left homeless and are the most vulnerable during such situations. More than a third of maternal deaths worldwide occur in crisis settings. In crisis situations, there is a lack of access to basic emergency-obstetric services and only a small proportion of deliveries are attended by skilled service providers, leading to preventable maternal and newborn morbidity. Young girls and boys are also at the danger of STIs, HIV and human trafficking. It is but, a grim reality that the risk of sexual assault, coercion and exploitation increases whenever social order breaks down and people are displaced. Temporary camps too can pose a great risk for women and girls who venture out alone to finish the daily chores. Crowding and lack of privacy can lead to gender-based violence. Accessing ante-natal and post-natal care too becomes a challenge. With health facilities in a dire situation and buildings inundated, pregnant women and new mothers find it extremely difficult to access quality healthcare. This is where International Planned Parenthood Federations (IPPFs) SPRINT initiative (Sexual and Reproductive Health Programme in Crisis and Post-Crisis Situations) comes into action. IPPF through the SPRINT Initiative works on providing key medical and SRH services to the affected population. According to government data, slow moving monsoon depression had caused lethal amounts of rain in Bangladesh on July 29, apart from forming cyclone storm Komen, which drenched the already submerged districts of the country. The heavy floods were followed by mudslides. As per reports, more than 200,000 people have been affected, out of which an estimated 25 per cent are women of reproductive age, 20 per cent men are sexually active, and we are reaching out to these people with key SRH services. IPPF-SPRINT along with its Member Association-Family Planning Association of Bangladesh (FPAB) is working closely with partners like UNFPA, government and other stake holders to implement the MISP including family planning services. In Bangladesh, we are working with FPAB in the districts of Coxs Bazar and Bandarban. IPPF, FPAB and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are working with the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and planning a co-ordinated effort to provide SRH services to the affected population. Maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality is preventable even during disasters, we just need to wake up to the fact that SRH is a priority and it is everybodys right. IPPF is worlds leading provider of sexual and reproductive health, and through this assistance which is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) of the Australian government, the organisation is trying to re-affirm the need for a movement to prioritise SRH during emergencies.

Discrimination: Encountering a psycho-social outlook,"The United Nations called on countries to examine discriminatory provisions in their laws and policies and make positive changes to ensure equality, inclusion and protection on Zero Discrimination Day, March 1, 2019:",,2019-03-15,The Daily Observer,"Avik Gangopadhyay The places of discrimination are easily identifiable. In spite of the presence of the ""equal opportunity acts"" in so many countries discrimination occurs in the broad public life such as accommodation, clubs, education, employment, goods and services, land sales and transfers, local government, sports, or in the workplace. Discrimination can take on a variety of forms, both direct and indirect, and can happen in any environment. With a few very rare exceptions, employers are prohibited from specifying an age preference in job advertisements. All employees, regardless of age, must receive the same benefits. But age discrimination in apprenticeship or internship programs or opportunities is visible. Employers are required to reasonably accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees as long as doing so will not have an excessively negative effect on the employer. It is illegal for businesses to discriminate against employees based on their religious customs. Hostile work environments exist when harassment or discrimination prevents or interferes with an employees ability to perform his or her job duties or creates an offensive environment for an employee or group of employees. Do men and women of the same qualifications, responsibility, skill level, and position receive equal pay? Employers are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of gender and from lowering one genders salary simply to equalize the pay between genders.In the workplace, employment discrimination can occur even before a person works for an organization or company. Even today we find at random stating or suggesting a preference for certain candidates in a job advertisement that is unrelated to a prospective employees qualifications or ability to perform the expected duties, or excluding certain potential employees during recruitment for reasons unrelated to their ability to perform the expected duties, or denying certain employees compensation or benefits, paying a different salary to an equally qualified candidate in the same position, discriminating when assigning disability or maternity leave, or when providing retirement options, denying or disrupting the use of company facilities, discriminatory treatment when issuing promotions or layoffs. There is a valid reason to treat harassment as a ploy of discrimination. Harassment is actually a form of discrimination. This includes unwelcome behaviour from a co-worker, manager, client, or another individual in the workplace based on race, colour, caste, religion, gender, nationality, age, disability, genetic information, or any other legally protected personal traits. People are bullied, ridiculed, treated unfavourably and because of personal characteristics, which are usually protected by the law. Even today attitude holds firm against laws: direct age discrimination happens when someone is treated unfavourably because of their age and indirect age discrimination happens when a requirement, condition or practice is imposed that disadvantages a person or group because of their age, and is not reasonable. Verbal abuse for carer status holders doesnt go unheard when someone who has total or substantial responsibility for ongoing care and support of another person. The dependent person may be a child, a partner, a parent, a relative or a friend. As most people will experience some kind of disability at some time in their lives, still disability discrimination prevents people from participating in community life and enjoying other human rights. It is against the law to discriminate against one because of sexual orientation, gender identity or lawful sexual activity, or what people assume these to be, or even ones marital status, but social restlessness is palpable in these matters. Marital status is whether one is, or is not, single, married, divorced, widowed, separated, a domestic partner or in a de facto relationship. Domestic partner refers to all couples, regardless of their sex and sexual orientation. In a close society do we remember these? Isnt it stupidous to discriminate because of physical features like ones height, weight, size, shape or another bodily characteristic? Even facial features, hair and birthmarks are not beyond critical study. Political belief or activity is another sphere where one takes another blow: if one has, or does not have, a lawful political belief, is, or is not, a member of a political party, takes part in, or refuses to take part in, political action determine the outcome in appointments and in socialising. Racial discrimination is one of the most common types of discrimination reported globally. Race includes colour, descent or ancestry, nationality or ethnic background, or any characteristics associated with a particular race. We forget that the indigenous rights are also protected under anti-discrimination laws. We dont remember that religious belief is about having, or not having, a religious belief or view. We react too much to religious activities, which are where one takes part, chooses not to take part or refuses to take part in a religious activity. In most of the developing countries, although men can experience sex discrimination, women are more likely to be discriminated against because of their sex. This is because of the much nourished fixation that women are more likely to care for children or other family members, and they may become pregnant or need to breastfeed a child. Until very recent, it was possible to be convicted of certain sexual and public morality offences. Although these laws no longer exist, a new attribute to the equal opportunity act has come into effect across the nations making it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the basis of an expunged homosexual conviction. In many countries, courts have the power to strike down laws that are discriminatory. But what about attitudes? Is social awareness an enough an attitude to combat these? Only in 2018 we find at least 20 countries imposed travel restrictions of some form against people living with HIV, around 29 countries reported that they require the consent of a womans husband or partner to access sexual and reproductive health services, 59 countries reported mandatory HIV testing for marriage, work or residence permits or for certain groups of people in the law, regulations or policies, 17 countries criminalized transgender people, 45 countries had laws that impose the need for parental consent for adolescents and young people below 18 years to access HIV testing services, 33 countries imposed the death penalty for drug offences in law and same-sex sexual relations were criminalized in at least 67 countries and territories worldwide. This can be done if individuals or organizations affected take legal action and wins the case for change, creating a strong gusto in favour in the social media. Avik Gangopadhyay is an author, educationist and columnist, writes from Kolkata, India The United Nations called on countries to examine discriminatory provisions in their laws and policies and make positive changes to ensure equality, inclusion and protection on Zero Discrimination Day, March 1, 2019: ""Laws must protect, not cause harm.

Addressing security threat to 'Silk Road' seen vital,,,,,"Addressing security threat to Silk Road seen vital Saleem Samad Published : Tuesday, 30 June, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 153 Security threat to the much hyped Kunming to Kolkata Silk Road needs to be addressed to achieve an economic reality of the mega plan. The ancient Silk Road has been revived by Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation (BCIM), a sub-regional organisation of Asian nations aimed at greater integration of trade and investment between the four countries. The BCIM corridor is an ambitious undertaking that hopes to connect Kunming with Kolkata. Leading Chinese scholars cautioned that ethnic insurgencies, terrorism, drug trafficking and the accompanying spread of HIV infections, antiques smuggling, as well as cross-border human trafficking, are may derail the mega plan. The Silk Road envisages formation of a thriving economic belt, focusing on cross-border transport, energy and telecommunication networks. An ancient trade route, Silk Road was formally established during the Han Dynasty of China, which linked the regions of the ancient world in commerce. A Chinese think-tank have proposed setting up a security mechanism and accelerating a legal dialogue among Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar, in order to turn the proposed BCIM corridor into an economic reality. Dr Ren Jia, President of the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, told prestigious The Hindu newspaper that a four-country institutional tie-up to address the non-traditional security threats to the BCIM project. Emphasising the non-traditional threats to security, Dr. Ren pointed out that the crucial issue needs to be addressed, otherwise the establishment of the corridor would be endangered. Fighting between Myanmar Army and ethnic Kokang rebels, known as the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, based near the Chinese border, pose a threat to the network. The United Wa State Army, notorious for narcotics trafficking, has virtually a free reign in north-eastern Myanmar, poses a big security problem to the BCIM corridor. Communal violence involving Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims has also flared in Rakhine State. Institutionalising a four-nation security partnership should become part of the recommendation of the Joint Study Group (JSG), which is expected to meet later this year in India. Focusing ""on strengthening connectivity in the BCIM region,"" the JSG was formed two years ago following a Sino-Indian initiative during the meeting between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2013. The concept developed in the 1990s came to be known as the Kunming Initiative, an economic cooperation within the BCIM region was the brainchild of Bangladeshi economist Professor Rehman Sobhan.",{},"['trafficking', 'security', 'seen', 'corridor', 'road', 'vital', 'bcim', 'addressing', 'economic', 'myanmar', 'silk', 'threat', 'chinese']","Addressing security threat to 'Silk Road' seen vital Saleem Samad Published : Tuesday, 30 June, 2015, Time : 12:00 AM, View Count : 153 Security threat to the much hyped Kunming to Kolkata 'Silk Road' needs to be addressed to achieve an economic reality of the mega plan.

The UN health agency said the death toll from the worst outbreak of Ebola in four decades had now climbed to 1,145 in the four afflicted West African countries-Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. ""It is deteriorating faster, and moving faster, than we can respond to,"" Joanne Liu, the chief of Doctors without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, told reporters in Geneva. She added that it could take six months to get the upper hand. ""It is like wartime,"" she said a day after returning from the region. ""I dont think we should focus on numbers. To really get a reality check, were not talking in terms of weeks, but months"" to control the epidemic."" Elhadj As Sy, the new head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, painted a similarly bleak picture after he too returned from west Africa. ""In Sierra Leone, weve already lost some of the best doctors, including one of the best virologists of the country-and not only of the country, but of the region. Nurses have been infected and also died,"" he said. As Sy added that he agreed with MSFs six-month timeline for bringing the outbreak under control. ?AFP The WHO said Thursday it was coordinating ""a massive scaling up of the international response"" to the epidemic. ""Staff at the outbreak sites sees evidence that the numbers of reported cases and deaths vastly underestimate the magnitude of the outbreak,"" it said. The epidemic erupted in the forested zone straddling the borders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia earlier this year and later spread to Nigeria. Liu said while Guinea was the initial epicentre of the disease, the pace there has slowed, with fears now focused on the other countries. ""If we dont stabilise Liberia, well never stabilise the region,"" Liu said. ATHLETES BARRED As countries around the world stepped up measures to contain the disease, the International Olympics Committee said athletes from Ebola-hit countries had been barred from competing in pool events and combat sports at the Youth Olympics opening in China on Saturday. The decision, which affects three unidentified athletes, was made ""to ensure the safety of all those participating"" in the Games in the city of Nanjing, the IOC and Chinese organisers said. No cure or vaccine is currently available for Ebola, with the WHO authorising the use of largely untested treatments in efforts to combat the disease. Hard-hit nations are awaiting consignments of up to 1,000 doses of the barely tested drug ZMapp from the United States, which has raised hopes of saving hundreds. Canada says between 800 and 1,000 doses of a vaccine called VSV-EBOV, which has shown promise in animal research but never been tested on humans, would also be distributed through the WHO. MSFs Liu warned against focusing on drugs. ""In the short term, theyre not going to help that much, because we dont have many drugs available. We need to a get a reality check on how this could impact the curve of the epidemic,"" she said. The last days of an Ebola victim can be grim, characterised by agonising muscular pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and catastrophic haemorrhaging described as ""bleeding out"" as vital organs break down. The cost of tackling the virus is also threatening to take a severe toll on the already impoverished West African nations hit by the epidemic. In Nigeria, in particular, a more serious outbreak could severely disrupt its oil and gas industry if international companies are forced to evacuate staff and shut operations, rating agency Moodys has warned. HOSTILITY TO HEALTH WORKERS Sierra Leones chief medical officer Brima Kargbo this week spoke of the risks facing health workers fighting the epidemic, which has killed 32 nurses since May as well as an eminent doctor, a tenth of the countrys fatalities. ""We still have to break the chain of transmission to separate the infected from the uninfected,"" Kargbo said. Nigerian sex workers also reported suspicion from customers, with business down drastically. One woman in Lagos who gave her name as Bright told AFP that Ebola was ""worse than HIV/AIDS. You can prevent HIV by using condoms but you cant do the same with Ebola."" Across the region, draconian travel restrictions have been imposed and a number of airlines have cancelled flights in and out of West Africa. Guinea, where at least 380 people have died, became the latest country to declare a health emergency, ordering strict controls at border points and a ban on moving bodies from one town to another.",{},"['health', 'outbreak', 'months', 'international', 'sierra', 'msf', 'region', 'moving', 'epidemic', 'ebola', 'control', 'west']","GENEVA, Aug 16 : The Ebola epidemic is moving faster than the authorities can handle and could take six months to bring under control, the medical charity MSF said on Friday.

Storing breast milk,"First scenario: Samia (pseudonym) is a garments worker. She went outside with her four months old sick baby. The baby got dehydrated due to diarrhea. The doctor detected formula feed as the culprit. The mother admitted that she was not very eager to feed formula, but duty period was a huge barrier.Second scenario: Rimi (pseudonym) has delivered a preterm low birth weight baby with cleft lip 2 days back. Initially she was admitted at obstetric ward due to her serious illness, while the baby was admitted at neonatal ward. The neonatologist advocated breast milk to be given to the baby through a feeding tube, at a certain amount, and at a fixed interval. In both cases, the mother felt the necessity to express breast milk and store it for their babies. In some conditions like preterm, low birth weight, unable to suck, sick babies, expressed breast milk may be needed. When mother is sick, has disease in breast, or works outside home for a longer period, she can store her expressed milk. A mother should prepare herself before expressing the milk. These preparations are aimed to stimulate 'oxytocin reflex', a key to milk secretion.1. She can sit quietly alone or with other mothers, who can motivate her.2. A baby on mother's lap or even photograph could be a good spur. 3. A warm bath or breast massage is beneficial.4. Gentle rubbing to the nipple is often helpful.After taking proper preparation the mother is ready to express milk. So, the next steps should be followed carefully.1. Wash the hands with soap and clean water.2. Select a washed, boiled, wide mouthed cup or container.3. Use thumb one side and other fingers another side to make a 'C' pattern around the nipple. Now gently squeeze the breast from periphery toward centre. Avoid hard pressing and pulling the nipple. 4. Collect the milk and feed baby with the help of spoon, cup, tube etc.5. If you want to store milk in several containers then label them accordingly. First collected milk should be fed earlier. Now the most important thing, how long I can store milk, shall be discussed. 1. Store in room temperature: 25-370C for up to 4 hours, 15-250C for up to 8 hours, Below 150C for up to 24 hours2. Store in refrigerator (2-4oC): up to 8 days.3. Deep freeze: up to 3 months. It is to be noted that don't boil milk directly after freezing, rather use boil water to heat the container. Using a bottle is always prohibited. You should consult with a pediatrician for further practical help and to determine amount of feed.In some countries, even in our neighbor country India, the concept of 'Human Milk Bank' is being increasingly practiced. It allows a baby having no biological mother or mother with HIV infection to drink breast milk exclusively at least for first six months of life.

Illness costs Africa hundreds of millions every year: WHO,"The World Health Organization has estimated that disease strips hundreds of millions of dollars from Africa’s economic output, as the burden of untreated disease hugely outweighs the potential expense of healthcare.In a report published at the end of a three-day UN forum for universal health coverage in Africa, the WHO estimated that the 47 countries in its Africa region lost approximately 630 million healthy working hours in 2015 due to disease, AFP reports.“A Heavy Burden: The Productivity Cost of Illness in Africa”, released Thursday, the WHO quantified that loss of productivity in economic terms.It estimates that, if nations fail to adequately invest in healthcare and sanitation, annual loss of gross domestic product (GDP) could equate to 2.4 trillion international dollars — a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power parity as the US dollar.“This is a huge cost to the Region and, indeed, for Africa as a whole,” said WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti in the report.“Implementing the recommended essential health services to address the main causes of morbidity and premature mortality in the region would almost halve this cost.”Countries south of the Sahara account for roughly half of the five million children around the world who each year die before their fifth birthday, while 40 percent of people with the AIDS virus in Africa still do not have access to HIV drugs.The WHO said the majority — 59 percent — of illnesses to cause the loss of healthy working hours were communicable diseases, maternal and nutritional conditions, with around 30 percent due to non-communicable diseases and some 10 percent down to injuries.Five countries — Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania — accounted for almost half of the work hours lost to poor health.The WHO made a case for the region to “invest adequately in the development of resilient national and local health systems”.It estimated that more than a third of the total cost of illness could be saved in 2030 if nations meet their health-related development goals.Development specialists say out-of-pocket expenditure for health is a major source of impoverishment in Africa.Universal health coverage is poor or absent across Africa, experts say, a view supported by a lack of statistics about the issue.In 2001, African Union countries pledged to allot at least 15 percent of their annual budget to health.

More Africans in extreme poverty than in 1990: UN,,,,,"UNITED NATIONS, July 8 : More sub-Saharan Africans are living in extreme poverty now than in 1990, said a major United Nations report on Monday, warning the region will miss most of its development goals. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), set in 2000, strive to halve extreme poverty and hunger in the world by 2015. They also promote and track progress in tackling issues such as AIDS, maternal and childhood mortality, access to clean water, gender equality and education. Many targets are within reach by the end of 2015, according to the United Nations annual MDG progress report: if current trends continue, targets on malaria, tuberculosis and access to HIV treatment will be surpassed, while the hunger target also looks to be within reach, it said. But it found that sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind the rest of the world in its progress, with population growth, conflicts and a decrease in international aid making the timely completion of many goals unlikely. After falling for two years, official development assistance spiked to a record $134.8 billion in 2013, the report said. However, with aid shifting away from those who need it most, net bilateral aid to Africa -- home to 34 of the 48 least developed countries -- fell by 5.6 percent last year. The report highlighted that sub-Saharan Africa is the only developing region that has seen a regular increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty -- from 290 million in 1990 to 414 million in 2010. While the proportion of people suffering from hunger fell from 33 percent in 1990-1992 to 25 percent in 2011-2013, the number of undernourished children increased from an estimated 27 million in 1990 to 32 million in 2012. ?AFP",{},"['development', 'progress', 'poverty', 'africans', 'extreme', 'million', 'united', 'subsaharan', 'hunger', 'report', '1990', 'nations']","UNITED NATIONS, July 8 : More sub-Saharan Africans are living in extreme poverty now than in 1990, said a major United Nations report on Monday, warning the region will miss most of its development goals.

Girl children: Victims of malnutrition,"Our children are our future leaders of the country, and the world as well. But, if the children suffer from malnutrition, a blind spot, they will grow up with lack of talents and knowledge; unfit for perfect leadership. Malnourished children face a daunting future with reduced intellectual capacity, frequent and higher risk of diseases. Malnutrition is responsible for making millions of children sick with life-threatening diseases; and unfortunately, three million children die every year just because we are not feeding them enough nutritious food, though the world has the capacity. So, it is our fault, and we are guilty to our children to keep them hungry and malnourished. Also we feel unnecessary and illogical shame to teach our children about sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). Girl children are the worst victims of malnutrition and deprivation of SRHR. Gender, food security, nutrition and SRHR issues are interlinked. Nutritional deficiencies result in negative reproductive health outcomes. If economic growth is presumed to get more children nutritious food, a booming economy alone does not make any change or difference of the problems of malnutrition and SRHR. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, rates of malnutrition in Bangladesh are among the highest in the world. More than 54 per cent of preschool-age children, equivalent to more than 9.5 million children are stunted, 56 per cent are underweight and more than 17 per cent are wasted. Although all administrative divisions were affected by child malnutrition, but there were important differences in the prevalence of the three anthropometric indicators. The prevalence of underweight ranged from 49.8 per cent in Khulna to 64 per cent in Sylhet, which also showed the highest prevalence of stunting 61.4 per cent and wasting 20.9 per cent. Bangladeshi children also suffer from high rates of micronutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin A, iron, iodine and zinc deficiency. Experts suggested to incorporate components for school-age children, and adolescents who will also benefit from improvements in nutrition. Improving nutrition can have a significant impact on survival as well as physical and cognitive development and productivity. Good nutrition, comprising adequate quality and quantity of food intake and reduction of illness is also a basic human right and is an essential input for economic development. There is a clear need to diversify food sources both in terms of land/environmental sustainability, development of the rural economy and increased consumption to achieve improvements in the nutritional status of the people of Bangladesh, FAO recommended. On the other hand, most of the children in Bangladesh do not have access to adequate information about their sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR). A strong social and cultural taboo around the issue causes a pervasive silence behind it. As a result, most adolescents enter into marriage and pregnancy without any adequate preparation. The current national school curriculum contains only minimum information about SRHR and often teachers are reluctant to teach the lessons. Research shows that Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. More than half of women marry before the age of 15 and nearly two in five girls aged 15 -17 are married. 57 per cent of these adolescents become mothers before the age of 19. Children and adolescents appear to be poorly informed with regard to their own sexuality, physical well-being, health, and bodies. Whatever knowledge they have, moreover, is incomplete and confused. Low rates of educational attainment, limited sex education, and inhibited attitudes toward sex, contribute to this ignorance.The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the crucial role of SRHR in ensuring the health and well-being of populations and in the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Worldwide, girls, younger than 18, are up to five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their twenties. Improved sexual and reproductive health is a key pillar of the overall health, empowerment, and human rights of individuals and of the sustainable and equitable development of societies. Ill-health from causes related to sexual and reproductive health including too many, too early and too frequent pregnancies, remains a major cause of death and disability among women and girls. It is particularly among the most vulnerable, marginalized and underserved. Poor sexual and reproductive health contributes significantly to poverty, thereby limiting socio-economic development. Conversely, achieving sexual and reproductive health empowers individuals and communities to participate in economic development, WHO mentioned. Nutrition and reproductive health experts observed that poverty, hunger, malnutrition, gender inequality, human rights, health, and SRHR issues are closely-related. So, considering the life-saving initiatives for the millions of children worldwide, we must ensure nutrition and food security, universal access to comprehensive, affordable, quality, child and gender-sensitive SRHR information with easy and local languages. Health services that need to provide to the girl children and adolescents include contraception, safe abortion, services to ensure maternal health and nutrition, promotion of indigenous local food in supplementary feeding programs with community participation, diagnostic and treatment services for STIs, HIV, infertility and reproductive cancers, counselling, and comprehensive sexuality education (CSE). Moreover, CSE must be non-discriminatory, rights based, evidence-based, child-friendly and age-appropriate, which addresses physical, mental, emotional and social dimensions of human sexuality. In terms of global health, it is defined as: 'Those health issues that transcend national boundaries and governments and call for actions on the global forces that determine the health of people'.As the G20 meeting agenda that was held in Hamburg, Germany on July 7-8, 2017 links health to interconnectedness, it follows an understanding of global health that is broader than development cooperation. So, now, this is the right time to put child health, nutrition, and SRHR issues high on the national and global health agenda. Let us come forward, feed the children with adequate nutritious food properly, and break the pervasive silence of sexual and reproductive health issues. We need to ensure the rights to know to save the valuable lives of our beloved children, the future assets of the world.
