HIV: Life expectancy and outlook,There is no set length of time that a person can live with HIV. Life expectancy increases as new treatments become available. People can now manage HIV as a chronic condition. Learn more here.,,,Medical News Today,"The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years. Thanks to advances in treatment, namely antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV can now expect to live long, healthy lives. When the HIV and AIDS epidemic began in the United States in the 1980s, HIV was a life-threatening condition. However, people can now manage it as a chronic health condition, much like they would diabetes or heart failure. In this article, we examine developments in managing and treating HIV, as well as the long-term outlook. Recent improvements Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. The increase in life expectancy for people living with HIV has direct links to improvements in medical therapy, which includes antiretroviral medications. These medications help suppress levels of HIV in the blood and slow damage resulting from the infection. This suppression helps prevent progression from HIV to AIDS, or stage 3 HIV. In the 1980s–1990s, antiretroviral therapy began as monotherapy, then it became dual therapy. Now, there is combination antiretroviral therapy, which includes using three or more drugs. There are several classes of antiretroviral drugs that attack HIV in different ways. Combinations of drugs are the first-line treatment. People typically start antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV. A 2017 study in the journal AIDS found that the additional life expectancy for people with HIV at age 20 during the early monotherapy era was 11.8 years. However, that number rose to 54.9 years for the most recent combination antiretroviral era. Researchers also concluded that people with HIV with higher education had a similar life expectancy to the general population. Future treatment options Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Researchers continue to work on a cure for HIV. In the meantime, combination antiretroviral therapy preserves the health of a person with HIV. It does this by suppressing the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. It is important for the person to follow their therapy plan precisely. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now report that when a person taking antiretroviral therapy has a negative viral load in their blood, the risk of transmitting the virus to a person without HIV is essentially zero. This discovery takes researchers to a notion of ""treatment as prevention,"" which promotes well-controlled HIV as a way to prevent transmission through sexual contact, needle sharing, and childbirth and breastfeeding. Because people with HIV are living much longer, they are starting to face the same health issues as other older adults. In fact, differentiating Alzheimers disease from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is becoming an emerging issue in the population of older adults living with HIV. Even with the advances in antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV may experience long-term side effects of either the therapy or HIV itself. Conditions common in long-standing HIV infection include: cardiovascular disease lung disease certain cancers HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders liver disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C HIV also appears to increase chronic inflammation in the body, putting a person at risk of certain health conditions. However, more research is necessary to better understand this. Antiretroviral medications have links to both short- and long-term side effects. Most side effects are manageable but can become serious. A person should speak with their healthcare provider about side effects that are of any concern. Long-term effects from antiretrovirals can include: kidney failure liver failure heart disease type 2 diabetes high blood cholesterol levels lipodystrophy, or changes in how the body stores fat osteoporosis neuropathy Outlook A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. Life expectancy for people living with HIV has seen great improvement in recent years. In fact, a person who currently has HIV can expect to add many years to their life once they start combination antiretroviral treatment. A 2017 study in the journal HIV Medicine indicates that a person with HIV living in a high-income country would add 43.3 years to their life expectancy if they receive a diagnosis at age 20. Without adequate treatment, however, HIV can quickly start to damage cells in the immune system. It is important for a person living with HIV to stick to their treatment plan to keep the virus suppressed in the blood. It is also essential for the person to work closely with their healthcare providers on a regular basis and maintain all other aspects of their health and well-being.",{},"['living', 'hiv', 'therapy', 'person', 'expectancy', 'effects', 'antiretroviral', 'health', 'life', 'treatment', 'outlook']","The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years.

HIV Transmission,,,,,"Some groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including the status of their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live. When you live in a community where many people have HIV infection, the chances of having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV are higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis atlas to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different US communities. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different populations. Gay and bisexual men have the largest number of new diagnoses in the United States. Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Also, transgender women who have sex with men are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, and injection drug users remain at significant risk for getting HIV. Risky behaviors, like having anal or vaginal sex without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV, and sharing needles or syringes play a big role in HIV transmission. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. If you don’t have HIV, being a receptive partner (or bottom) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for getting HIV. If you do have HIV, being the insertive partner (or top) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for transmitting HIV. But there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, and using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV. Learn more about these and other strategies to prevent HIV. For more information about the risk for different groups of people, see HIV in the United States and HIV by Geographical Distribution.

HIV/AIDS - Symptoms and causes,,,,Mayo Clinic,"Overview Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your bodys ability to fight the organisms that cause disease. HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS. Theres no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. Symptoms The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. Primary infection (Acute HIV) Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include: Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells. This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if youre not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Progression to AIDS Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today dont develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years. When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. Youll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldnt usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system. The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include: Soaking night sweats Recurring fever Chronic diarrhea Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth Persistent, unexplained fatigue Weight loss Skin rashes or bumps When to see a doctor If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible. Causes HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. How does HIV become AIDS? HIV destroys CD4 T cells — white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication. How HIV spreads To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways: By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.

By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies. How HIV doesnt spread You cant become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you cant catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isnt spread through the air, water or insect bites. Risk factors When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now its clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, youre at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. Use intravenous drugs. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other peoples blood. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other peoples blood. Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV. Complications HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers. Infections common to HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. Its a leading cause of death among people with AIDS.

This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.

This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain.

Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. Cryptosporidiosis. This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite thats commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS. Cancers common to HIV/AIDS Kaposis sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposis sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.

This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin. Other complications Wasting syndrome. Aggressive treatment approaches have reduced the number of cases of wasting syndrome, but it still affects many people with AIDS. Its defined as a loss of at least 10 percent of body weight, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever.

Researchers at Paris Institut Pasteur claim they have successfully destroyed cells infected with the virus, which is typically treated with antiretroviral drugs. The drugs are unable to remove the virus from the body, but medical journal Cell Metabolism yesterday published findings which announced that scientists had found a way to eliminate infected reservoir cells. In a news release uploaded to EurekaAlert, an Institut Pasteur spokesperson said: The antiretroviral treatment used today is designed to block HIV infection but it is not able to eliminate the virus from the body. The virus remains in reservoirs - the CD4 T lymphocyte immune cells, the main targets of HIV. HIV targets cells with high metabolic activity and hijacks their energy in order to multiply. The release later states: Thanks to metabolic activity inhibitors, the researchers have managed to destroy these infected cells, or ""reservoirs"", ex vivo. It concludes by stating that the research opens the possibility of new pathways towards remission by eliminating the reservoir cells. The next step in research will be assessing the potential of metabolic inhibitors in vivo - tested on living organisms. In theory, if the viral load is low enough, destroying the cell HIV hides in and draws energy from could keep it from spreading in the body and, perhaps, eradicate it altogether, it is hoped.

The researchers say it is too early to say the patient is “cured” of HIV. Experts say the approach is not practical for treating most people with HIV but may one day help find a cure. The male London patient, who has not been named, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2012.

Researchers from University College London, Imperial College London, Cambridge and Oxford Universities were all involved in the case.This is the second time a patient treated this way has ended up in remission from HIV. Ten years ago, another patient in Berlin received a bone-marrow transplant from a donor with natural immunity to the virus. Timothy Brown, said to be the first person to “beat” HIV/Aids, was given two transplants and total body irradiation (radiotherapy) for leukaemia - a much more aggressive treatment. “By achieving remission in a second patient using a similar approach, we have shown that the Berlin patient was not an anomaly and that it really was the treatment approaches that eliminated HIV in these two people,” said lead study author Prof Ravindra Gupta, from UCL.

End to Aids in sight as huge study finds drugs stop HIV transmission,,,,,"End to Aids in sight as huge study finds drugs stop HIV transmission Paper says risk between male partners is zero if virus fully suppressed by antiretrovirals Independent Online Desk/ The Guardian An end to the Aids epidemic could be in sight after a landmark study found men whose HIV infection was fully suppressed by antiretroviral drugs had no chance of infecting their partner. The success of the medicine means that if everyone with HIV were fully treated, there would be no further infections. Among nearly 1,000 male couples across Europe where one partner with HIV was receiving treatment to suppress the virus, there were no cases of transmission of the infection to the HIV-negative partner during sex without a condom. Although 15 men were infected with HIV during the eight-year study, DNA testing proved that was through sex with someone other than their partner who was not on treatment.“It’s brilliant – fantastic. This very much puts this issue to bed,” said Prof Alison Rodger from University College London, the co-leader of the paper published in the Lancet medical journal. Earlier studies have also shown the treatment protects heterosexual couples where one partner has HIV. She added: “Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART [antiretroviral therapy] is zero. Our findings support the message of the international U=U campaign that an undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable. “This powerful message can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission, and tackling the stigma and discrimination that many people with HIV face.“Increased efforts must now focus on wider dissemination of this powerful message and ensuring that all HIV-positive people have access to testing, effective treatment, adherence support and linkage to care to help maintain an undetectable viral load.” In 2017, there were almost 40 million people worldwide living with HIV, of whom 21.7 million were on antiretroviral treatment. An estimated 101,600 people are living with HIV in the UK, and of these, about 7,800 are undiagnosed, so do not know they are HIV positive. Myron S Cohen of the UNC Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at Chapel Hill in North Carolina, said in a commentary in the Lancet on the study that it should push the world forward on a strategy to test and treat everyone who has HIV. But, he added, maximising the benefits of treatment, particularly for men who have sex with men, has proved difficult. “It is not always easy for people to get tested for HIV or find access to care; in addition, fear, stigma, homophobia and other adverse social forces continue to compromise HIV treatment,” he said. “Diagnosis of HIV infection is difficult in the early stages of infection when transmission is very efficient, and this limitation also compromises the treatment as prevention strategy.”According to the National Aids Trust, 97% of people on HIV treatment in the UK have an undetectable level of the virus, meaning they cannot pass it on. “Hearing this can be enormously empowering and reassuring to people living with HIV,” said Deborah Gold, the trust’s chief executive. Advertisement The latest findings reinforce the importance of people taking HIV tests frequently, which could ultimately end the transmission of the virus altogether in the future. New diagnoses have been declining since their peak in 2005, with figures from 2017 showing a 17% drop on 2016 and a 28% fall compared with 2015. Late diagnosis remains a major challenge, still accounting for about 43% of new HIV diagnoses. This disproportionately affects certain groups, including black African heterosexual men and people aged 65 and older. “If we don’t reduce late diagnosis, there will always be those who are not aware of their HIV status and who therefore cannot access treatment,” said Gold. “We think that the findings from this study could be incredibly powerful in breaking down some of the barriers to testing in communities where there is still a lot of stigma around HIV.” However, she added that government funding cuts to specialist health services would make it more difficult to achieve a goal of eliminating transmission by 2030. Jens Lundgren, a professor of infectious diseases at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, and joint-lead for the study, called Partner, said: “We have now provided the conclusive scientific evidence for how treatment effectively prevents further sexual transmission of HIV.” Dr Michael Brady, the medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “It is impossible to overstate the importance of these findings. “The Partner study has given us the confidence to say, without doubt, that people living with HIV who are on effective treatment cannot pass the virus on to their sexual partners. This has incredible impact on the lives of people living with HIV and is a powerful message to address HIV-related stigma.” Bruce Richman, the founding executive director of the Prevention Access Campaign, which launched U=U, said Pac was tremendously grateful to the researchers and participants. He said the study “has for ever changed what it means to live and love with HIV around the world”. In a linked comment in the journal, Cohen expressed optimism for future treatment of Aids. “During the course of these studies, antiretroviral drugs have become more effective, reliable, durable, easier to take, well tolerated and much less expensive,” he said. “The results … provide yet one more catalyst for a universal test-and-treat strategy to provide the full benefits of antiretroviral drugs. This and other strategies continue to push us toward the end of Aids.” Case study Alex Sparrowhawk, 34, has been living with HIV for almost 10 years. When he was diagnosed in November 2009, he had two major concerns: how being HIV positive would impact his work as a financial analyst, and what it meant for future relationships.“I was single at the time,” he said. “Just navigating what to do – when to tell people and how to talk to people was really difficult.” Alex immediately began antiretroviral treatment, initially taking four pills a day, which was reduced to one pill once his viral load came down to undetectable levels several months later. The latest results confirm that for the past nine years, he has not been able to transmit the virus to anyone, although at the time, medical advice was less definitive. Between his diagnosis and now, Alex spent six-and-a-half years in a relationship, and said the possibility – however tiny – of transmitting HIV to his partner was a source of anxiety. “You’d be told it was very unlikely, or that it was only possible under certain circumstances like having an STI,” he said. “But you’re constantly worried about these caveats and you go through this worry together. “Now we can say zero risk, which is just so much more empowering for people. It’s a huge weight off your shoulders.” Alex hopes the findings will help transform public attitudes about HIV, bringing them in line with medical evidence. “A lot of stigma is driven by fear of being exposed to HIV,” he said. “People still think you can get it from kissing and casual contact. If more people knew about this study, this would change.” KK",{},"['sight', 'huge', 'living', 'study', 'findings', 'hiv', 'stop', 'finds', 'drugs', 'partner', 'antiretroviral', 'end', 'transmission', 'virus', 'men', 'treatment', 'aids']","End to Aids in sight as huge study finds drugs stop HIV transmissionPaper says risk between male partners is zero if virus fully suppressed by antiretroviralsIndependent Online Desk/ The GuardianAn end to the Aids epidemic could be in sight after a landmark study found men whose HIV infection was fully suppressed by antiretroviral drugs had no chance of infecting their partner.

The aggressive therapy was primarily used to treat the patients cancer, not his HIV. Current HIV therapies are really effective, meaning people with the virus can live long and healthy lives. But the reason this case is so significant is that it could help experts who are looking for new ways to tackle HIV and achieve a cure. Understanding how the body can naturally resist the infection does offer up hope of this, even if it is still a long way off. Prof Eduardo Olavarria, also involved in the research, from Imperial College London, said the success of stem cell transplantation offered hope that new strategies could be developed to tackle the virus. But he added: ""The treatment is not appropriate as a standard HIV treatment because of the toxicity of chemotherapy, which in this case was required to treat the lymphoma."" The patient was able to stop taking antiretroviral therapy drugs to control his HIV How does it work? CCR5 is the most commonly used receptor by HIV-1 - the virus strain of HIV that dominates around the world - to enter cells. But a very small number of people who are resistant to HIV have two mutated copies of the CCR5 receptor. This means the virus cannot penetrate cells in the body that it normally infects. The London patient received stem cells from a donor with this specific genetic mutation, which made him resistant to HIV as well. But a reservoir of cells carrying HIV can still remain in the body, in a resting state, for many years. The UK researchers say it may be possible to use gene therapy to target the CCR5 receptor in people with HIV, now they know the Berlin patients recovery was not a one-off. Prof Graham Cooke, National Institute for Health Research research professor and reader in infectious diseases from Imperial College London, said the results were ""encouraging"". ""If we can understand better why the procedure works in some patients and not others, we will be closer to our ultimate goal of curing HIV. ""At the moment the procedure still carries too much risk to be used in patients who are otherwise well."" Potentially significant Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician at Cardiff University, said it was an ""interesting and potentially significant report"". But he said much longer follow-up would be needed to ensure the virus did not re-emerge at a later stage. ""While this type of treatment is clearly not practical to treat the millions of people around the world living with HIV, reports such as these may help in the ultimate development of a cure for HIV."" In the meantime, he said the focus needed to be on diagnosing HIV promptly and starting patients on lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome) refers to the most advanced stages of HIV infection, defined by the occurrence of any of more than 20 opportunistic infections or related cancers. HIV can be transmitted in several ways HIV can be transmitted through: unprotected sexual intercourse (vaginal or anal) or oral sex with an infected person; transfusions of contaminated blood or blood products ortransplantation of contaminated tissue; the sharing of contaminated injecting equipment and solutions (needles, syringes) or tattooing equipment; through the use of contaminated surgical equipment and other sharp instruments; the transmission between a mother and her baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. There are several ways to prevent HIV transmission Key ways to prevent HIV transmission: practice safe sexual behaviours such as using condoms; get tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV to prevent onward transmission; avoid injecting drugs, or if you do, always use sterile needles and syringes; ensure that any blood or blood products that you might need are tested for HIV; access voluntary medical male circumcision if you live in one of the 14 countries where this intervention is promoted; if you have HIV start antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible for your own health and to prevent HIV transmission to your sexual or drug using partner or to your infant (if you are pregnant or breastfeeding); use pre-exposure prophylaxis prior to engaging in high risk behaviour;demand post-exposure prophylaxis if there is the risk that you have been exposed to HIV infection in both occupational and non-occupational settings; 36.7 million people are living with HIV worldwide. Globally, an estimated 36.7 million (34.0–39.8 million) people were living with HIV in 2015, and 1.8 million (1.5–2.0 million) of these were children. The vast majority of people living with HIV are in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 2.1 million (1.8–2.4 million) people were newly infected with with HIV in 2015. An estimated 35 million people have died from HIV-related causes so far, including 1.1 million (940 000–1.3 million) in 2015. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevents HIV from multiplying in the body If the reproduction of HIV stops, then the bodys immune cells are able to live longer and provide the body with protection from infections. Effective ART results in a reduction in viral load, the amount of virus in the body, greatly reducing the risk of transmitting the virus sexual partners. If the HIV positive partner in a couple is on effective ART, the likelihood of sexual transmission to the HIV-negative partner can be reduced by as much as 96%. Expanding coverage of HIV treatment contributes to HIV prevention efforts. As of mid-2016, 18.2 million people were receiving ART worldwide Of these, more than 16 million lived in low- and middle-income countries. In 2016, WHO released the second edition of the ""Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection.” These guidelines present several new recommendations, including the recommendation to provide lifelong ART to all children, adolescents and adults, including all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count as soon as possible after diagnosis. WHO has also expanded earlier recommendations to offer pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) to selected people at substantial risk of acquiring HIV. Alternative first-line treatment regimens are also recommended. HIV testing can help to ensure treatment for people in need Access to HIV testing and medicines should be dramatically accelerated in order to reach the goal of ending AIDS by 2030. HIV testing reach is still limited, as an estimated 40% of people with HIV or over 14 million people remain undiagnosed and dont know their infection status. WHO is recommending innovative HIV-self-testing and partner notification approaches to increase HIV testing services among undiagnosed people. An estimated 1.8 million children are living with HIV According to 2015 figures most of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and were infected through transmission from their HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. Close to 150 000 children (110 000–190 000) became newly infected with HIV in 2015. Elimination of mother-to-child-transmission is becoming a reality Access to preventive interventions remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries. But progress has been made in some areas such as prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and keeping mothers alive. In 2015, almost 8 out of 10 pregnant women living with HIV – 1.1 million women – received antiretrovirals worldwide. In 2015, Cuba was the first country declared by WHO as having eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. In June 2016, 3 other countries: Armenia, Belarus and Thailand were also validated for eliminating mother-to-child HIV. HIV is the greatest risk factor for developing active TB disease In 2015, an estimated 1.2 million (11%) of the 10.4 million people who developed TB worldwide were HIV-positive. In the same year approximately 390 000 deaths from tuberculosis occurred among people living with HIV. The WHO African Region accounted for around 75% of the estimated number of HIV-related TB deaths.",{},"['living', 'sexual', 'countries', 'hivaids', 'risk', 'hiv', '2015', 'transmission', 'facts', 'estimated', 'million', 'infection']","AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome) refers to the most advanced stages of HIV infection, defined by the occurrence of any of more than 20 opportunistic infections or related cancers.

HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. The abbreviation “HIV” can refer to the virus or to HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells of the immune system. The loss of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight infections and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and advance to AIDS. How is HIV spread? HIV is spread through contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV. These body fluids include: Blood Semen Pre-seminal fluid Vaginal fluids Rectal fluids Breast milk The spread of HIV from person to person is called HIV transmission. The spread of HIV from a woman with HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding is called mother-to-child transmission of HIV. To reduce your risk of HIV infection, use condoms correctly every time you have sex, limit your number of sexual partners, and n Key Points • HIV gradually destroys the immune system by attacking and killing a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell. CD4 cells play a major role in protecting the body from infection. • HIV uses the machinery of the CD4 cells to multiply (make copies of itself) and spread throughout the body. This process, which is carried out in seven steps or stages, is called the HIV life cycle. HIV medicines protect the immune system by blocking HIV at different stages of the HIV life cycle. • Antiretroviral therapy or ART is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes every day. Because each class of drugs is designed to target a specific step in the HIV life cycle, ART is very effective at preventing HIV from multiplying. ART also reduces the risk of HIV drug resistance. • ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission (the spread of HIV to others). ever share injection drug equipment. Also talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who don’t have HIV but who are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day. Mother-to-child transmission is the most common way that children get HIV. HIV medicines, given to women with HIV during pregnancy and childbirth and to their babies after birth, reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. You can’t get HIV by shaking hands or hugging a person who has HIV. You also can’t get HIV from contact with objects such as dishes, toilet seats, or doorknobs used by a person with HIV. HIV is not spread through the air or in water or by mosquitoes, ticks, or other blood-sucking insects. What is the treatment for HIV? Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. (HIV medicines are often called antiretrovirals or ARVs.) ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART prevents HIV from multiplying and reduces the amount of HIV in the body (also called the viral load). Having less HIV in the body protects the immune system and prevents HIV infection from advancing to AIDS. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. A main goal of ART is to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level. An undetectable viral load means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a viral load test. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex. What are the symptoms of HIV/AIDS? Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, some people may have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, or rash. The symptoms may last for a few days to several weeks. After this earliest stage of HIV infection, HIV continues to multiply but at very low levels. More severe symptoms of HIV infection, such as signs of opportunistic infections, generally don’t appear for many years. (Opportunistic infections are infections and infection-related cancers that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in people with healthy immune systems.) Without treatment with HIV medicines, HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though it may advance faster in some people. HIV transmission is possible at any stage of HIV infection—even if a person with HIV has no symptoms of HIV. How is AIDS diagnosed? Symptoms such as fever, weakness, and weight loss may be a sign that a person’s HIV has advanced to AIDS. However, a diagnosis of AIDS is based on the following criteria: A drop in CD4 count to less than 200 cells/mm3. A CD4 count measures the number of CD4 cells in a sample of blood. OR The presence of certain opportunistic infections. Although an AIDS diagnosis indicates severe damage to the immune system, HIV medicines can still help people at this stage of HIV infection. The HIV Life Cycle What is the HIV life cycle? HIV attacks and destroys the CD4 cells of the immune system. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that play a major role in protecting the body from infection. HIV uses the machinery of the CD4 cells to multiply (make copies of itself) and spread throughout the body. This process, which is carried out in seven steps or stages, is called the HIV life cycle. What is the connection between the HIV life cycle and HIV medicines? Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. HIV medicines protect the immune system by blocking HIV at different stages of the HIV life cycle. HIV medicines are grouped into different drug classes according to how they fight HIV. Each class of drugs is designed to target a specific step in the HIV life cycle. Because an HIV regimen includes HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes, ART is very effective at preventing HIV from multiplying. Having less HIV in the body protects the immune system and prevents HIV from advancing to AIDS. ART also reduces the risk of HIV drug resistance. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission (the spread of HIV to others). What are the seven stages of the HIV life cycle? The seven stages of the HIV life cycle are: 1) binding, 2) fusion, 3) reverse transcription, 4) integration, 5) replication, 6) assembly, and 7) budding. To understand each stage in the HIV life cycle, it helps to first imagine what HIV looks like. The Basics of HIV Prevention How is HIV spread? The person-to-person spread of HIV is called HIV transmission. HIV is transmitted (spread) only in certain body fluids from a person who has HIV: Blood Semen Key Points • HIV is spread only in certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. These fluids are blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. • In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by having sex or sharing injection drug equipment, such as needles, with someone who has HIV. • To reduce your risk of HIV infection, use condoms correctly every time you have sex. Don’t inject drugs. If you do, use only sterile injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others. • If you don’t have HIV but are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV, talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Pre-seminal fluids Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk HIV transmission is only possible if these fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or are directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe). Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the mouth. HIV can also spread from a woman with HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth (also called labor and delivery), or breastfeeding. This spread of HIV is called mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In the past, some people were infected with HIV after receiving a blood transfusion or organ or tissue transplant from a donor with HIV. Today, this risk is very low because donated blood, organs, and tissues are carefully tested in the United States. You can’t get HIV from casual contact with a person who has HIV, for example from a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. And you can’t get HIV from contact with objects such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. How can I reduce my risk of getting HIV? Anyone can get HIV, but you can take steps to protect yourself from HIV infection. Get tested and know your partner’s HIV status. Talk to your partner about HIV testing and get tested before you have sex. Use this testing locator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to find an HIV testing location near you. Have less risky sex. HIV is mainly spread by having anal or vaginal sex without a condom or without taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Use condoms. Use a condom correctly every time you have sex. Read this fact sheet from CDC on how to use condoms correctly. Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with HIV whose HIV is not well controlled or to have a partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Both of these factors can increase the risk of HIV transmission. Get tested and treated for STDs. Insist that your partners get tested and treated too. Having an STD can increase your risk of becoming infected with HIV or spreading it to others. Talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who don’t have HIV but who are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day. Don’t inject drugs. But if you do, use only sterile drug injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others. I am HIV positive but my partner is HIV negative. How can I protect my partner from HIV? Take HIV medicines daily. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART can’t cure HIV infection, but it can reduce the amount of HIV in the body (also called the viral load). A main goal of ART is to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level. An undetectable viral load means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a viral load test. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex. Here are some other steps you can take to protect your partner from HIV: Use condoms correctly every time you have sex. Talk to your partner about taking PrEP. If you inject drugs, don’t share your needles, syringes, or other drug equipment with your partner. Are HIV medicines used in other situations to prevent HIV infection? Yes, HIV medicines are also used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) PEP is the use of HIV medicines to reduce the risk of HIV infection soon after a possible exposure to HIV. PEP may be used, for example, after a person has sex without a condom with a person who has HIV or after a health care worker is accidentally exposed to HIV in the workplace. To be effective, PEP must be started within 3 days after the possible exposure to HIV. PEP involves taking HIV medicines each day for 28 days. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV Women with HIV take HIV medicines during pregnancy and childbirth to reduce the risk of passing HIV to their babies and to protect their own health. Their newborn babies also receive HIV medicine for 4 to 6 weeks after birth. The HIV medicine reduces the risk of infection from any HIV that may have entered a baby’s body during childbirth. HIV Treatment: The Basics Key Points • Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. • ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. People with HIV should start ART as soon as possible. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. • Before starting ART, people with HIV talk to their health care provider about possible side effects of HIV medicines and potential drug interactions between HIV medicines or between HIV medicines and other medicines a person is taking. • Overall, the benefits of HIV medicines far outweigh the risk of side effects. In addition, newer HIV regimens cause fewer side effects than regimens used in the past. What is antiretroviral therapy? Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. How do HIV medicines work? HIV attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells of the immune system. Loss of CD4 cells makes it hard for the body to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. HIV medicines prevent HIV from multiplying (making copies of itself), which reduces the amount of HIV in the body (also called the viral load). Having less HIV in the body gives the immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in the body, the immune system is strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. By reducing the amount of HIV in the body, HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission. A main goal of ART is to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level. An undetectable viral load means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a viral load test. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex. When is it time to start taking HIV medicines? People with HIV should start ART as soon as possible. In people with the following conditions, it’s especially important to start ART right away: pregnancy, AIDS, certain HIV-related illnesses and coinfections, and early HIV infection. (Early HIV infection is the period up to 6 months after infection with HIV.) What HIV medicines are included in an HIV regimen? There are many HIV medicines available for HIV regimens. The HIV medicines are grouped into seven drug classes according to how they fight HIV. A person’s initial HIV regimen usually includes three HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes. Selection of an HIV regimen depends on several factors, including possible side effects of HIV medicines and potential drug interactions between medicines. Because the needs of people with HIV vary, there are several HIV regimens to choose from. What should people know about taking HIV medicines? Here are some things health care providers discuss with their patients before prescribing HIV medicines. Side effects Sometimes HIV medicines can cause side effects. Most side effects from HIV medicines are manageable, but a few can be serious. Overall, the benefits of HIV medicines far outweigh the risk of side effects. In addition, newer HIV regimens cause fewer side effects than regimens used in the past. As HIV treatment options continue to improve, people are less likely to experience side effects from their HIV medicines. Side effects from HIV medicines can vary depending on the medicine and the person taking the medicine. People taking the same HIV medicine can have very different side effects. Some side effects, like headaches or occasional dizziness, may not be serious. Other side effects, such as swelling of the throat and tongue or liver damage, can be life-threatening. Drug interactions HIV medicines can interact with other HIV medicines in an HIV regimen. They can also interact with other medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products. A drug interaction can reduce or increase a medicines effect on the body. Drug interactions can also cause unwanted side effects. Drug resistance When HIV multiplies in the body, the virus sometimes mutates (changes form) and makes variations of itself. Variations of HIV that develop while a person is taking HIV medicines can lead to drug-resistant strains of HIV. HIV medicines that previously controlled a person’s HIV are not effective against the new, drug-resistant HIV. In other words, the person’s HIV continues to multiply. Poor adherence to an HIV regimen—not taking HIV medicines every day and exactly as prescribed—increases the risk of drug resistance and treatment failure.",{},"['called', 'hivaids', 'risk', 'art', 'hiv', 'spread', 'body', 'medicines', 'person', 'basics', 'drug', 'infection']","HIV medicines protect the immune system by blocking HIV at different stages of the HIV life cycle.

Dovato, a two-drug regimen (2DR), reduces exposure to the number of ARVs from the start of treatment, while still maintaining the efficacy and high barrier to resistance of a traditional DTG-based three-drug regimen. Important information If you have both human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, Dovato can cause serious side effects, including: Resistant HBV infection. Your healthcare provider will test you for HBV infection before you start treatment. If you have HIV-1 and hepatitis B, the hepatitis B virus can change (mutate) during your treatment and become harder to treat (resistant). It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in people who have HIV-1 and HBV infection. Worsening of HBV infection. If you have HIV-1 and HBV infection, your HBV may get worse (flare-up) if you stop taking Dovato. A “flare-up” is when your HBV infection suddenly returns in a worse way than before. Worsening liver disease can be serious and may lead to death. Do not run out of your prescription. Refill your prescription or talk to your healthcare provider before your medicine is all gone. Do not stop treatment without first talking to your healthcare provider. If you stop treatment, your healthcare provider will need to check your health often and do blood tests regularly for several months to check your liver. Dovato is a prescription medicine that is used without other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infection in adults: who have not received antiretroviral medicines in the past, and without known resistance to the medicines dolutegravir or lamivudine. HIV-1 is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in children. Do not take Dovato if you: have ever had an allergic reaction to a medicine that contains dolutegravir or lamivudine. take dofetilide. Before you take Dovato, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have or have had liver problems, including hepatitis B or C infection. have kidney problems. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. One of the medicines in Dovato (dolutegravir) may harm your unborn baby. You should not take Dovato if you are planning to become pregnant or during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a different medicine if you are planning to become pregnant or become pregnant during treatment with Dovato. If you can become pregnant, your healthcare provider will perform a pregnancy test before you start treatment. If you can become pregnant, you should consistently use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you are planning to become pregnant, you become pregnant, or think you may be pregnant during treatment. Pregnancy Registry. There is a pregnancy registry for people who take antiretroviral medicines, including Dovato, during pregnancy. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about how you can take part in this registry. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Do not breastfeed if you take Dovato. You should not breastfeed if you have HIV-1 because of the risk of passing HIV-1 to your baby. One of the medicines in Dovato (lamivudine) passes into your breast milk. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-thecounter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines interact with Dovato. Keep a list of your medicines and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with Dovato. Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can tell you if it is safe to take Dovato with other medicines. Dovato side effects Dovato can cause serious side effects, including: Allergic reactions.

The treatment, which aims to provide immunity against various strains of the virus, produced an anti-HIV immune system response in tests on 393 people, a study in the Lancet found. It also protected some monkeys from a virus that is similar to HIV. More testing is now needed to determine if the immune response produced can prevent HIV infection in people.About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids, and there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. But despite advances in treatment for HIV, both a cure and a vaccine for the virus have so far remained elusive. The drug Prep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is effective at preventing HIV infection, but, unlike a vaccine, it needs to be taken regularly, even daily, to prevent the virus from taking hold. Inventing a vaccine has proved an immense challenge for scientists, in part because there are so many strains of the virus, but also because HIV is adept at mutating to elude attack from our immune systems. Previous attempts at HIV vaccines have been limited to specific strains of the virus found in certain parts of the world. But for this ""mosaic"" vaccine, scientists have developed a treatment made up of pieces of different HIV viruses. The hope is that it could offer much better protection against the almost unlimited number of HIV strains found across the world.In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, scientists tested various combinations of the mosaic vaccine in people aged 18 to 50 who did not have HIV and were healthy. The participants, from the US, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand, received four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks. All of the vaccine combinations produced an anti-HIV immune system response and were found to be safe. Scientists also carried out a parallel study where they gave rhesus monkeys the vaccine to protect them from getting simian-human immunodeficiency virus - a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys. The mosaic vaccine combination that showed the most promise in humans was found to protect 67% of the 72 monkeys from getting the disease. ""These results represent an important milestone,"" said Dan Barouch, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study. However, Prof Barouch also cautioned that the findings needed to be interpreted with caution. Though the vaccine triggered a response in the immune system of the people who took it, it is not clear if this would be enough to fight off the virus and prevent infection. ""The challenges in the development of an HIV vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to induce HIV-specific immune responses does not necessarily indicate that a vaccine will protect humans from HIV infection,"" he added. Promising signs Nevertheless, the promising results of the study mean researchers will next test the treatment on 2,600 women in southern Africa who are at risk of getting the illness - one of only five vaccines to make it to this stage of so-called efficacy trials. Only one vaccine has ever shown evidence of protecting against HIV. A vaccine tested in Thailand lowered the rate of human infection by 31%, but the effect was considered too low to advance it to common use. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was early days for the vaccine but the signs were ""promising"". ""However, its important to be cautious and be clear that theres a lot of work to do before an effective HIV vaccine is readily available."" Dr Brady added that in the meantime there were already tools that were effective for preventing the disease from spreading, such as contraception and treatments for HIV-positive people that prevent them from passing on the virus.BBC.

Scientists destroy HIV-infected cells in major breakthrough,,,,,"Scientists destroy HIV-infected cells in major breakthrough According to researchers they have successfully destroyed cells infected with virus, typically treated with antiretroviral drugs Independent Online Desk Scientists have announced a potentially major breakthrough in the fight against HIV. Researchers at Paris Institut Pasteur claim they have successfully destroyed cells infected with the virus, which is typically treated with antiretroviral drugs. The drugs are unable to remove the virus from the body, but medical journal Cell Metabolism yesterday published findings which announced that scientists had found a way to eliminate infected reservoir cells. In a news release uploaded to EurekaAlert, an Institut Pasteur spokesperson said: The antiretroviral treatment used today is designed to block HIV infection but it is not able to eliminate the virus from the body. The virus remains in reservoirs - the CD4 T lymphocyte immune cells, the main targets of HIV. HIV targets cells with high metabolic activity and hijacks their energy in order to multiply. The release later states: Thanks to metabolic activity inhibitors, the researchers have managed to destroy these infected cells, or ""reservoirs"", ex vivo. It concludes by stating that the research opens the possibility of new pathways towards remission by eliminating the reservoir cells. The next step in research will be assessing the potential of metabolic inhibitors in vivo - tested on living organisms. In theory, if the viral load is low enough, destroying the cell HIV hides in and draws energy from could keep it from spreading in the body and, perhaps, eradicate it altogether, it is hoped.

Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of flu-like illnesstypically; this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as weight loss, tumors and infections. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. .In 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide.HIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination. The disease also has large economic impacts. It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including, discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior information and confidentiality; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the segregation of HIV infected individuals. Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV .Often, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with prostitution, homosexuality,and I.Vdrug abuse.HIV is transmitted by three main routes: sexual contact , significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission. There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.It is possible to be co-infected by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV super infection.The second most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment.The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, with an average of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery, or through breast milk resulting in infection in the baby This is the third most common way in which HIV is transmitted globally In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20% and in those who also breastfeed 35%.As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children. With appropriate treatment the risk of mother-to-child infection can be reduced to about 1%.Preventive treatment involves the mother taking antiretroviral during pregnancy and delivery, and administering antiretroviral drugs to the newborn.HIV medicines work by preventing HIV from multiplying, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Having less HIV in the body reduces a womans risk of passing HIV to her child during pregnancy and childbirth. Having less HIV in the body also protects the womans health.Some of the HIV medicine passes from the pregnant woman to her unborn baby. This transfer of HIV medicine protects the baby from HIV infection, especially during a vaginal delivery when the baby passes through the birth canal and is exposed to any HIV in the mother’s blood or other fluids.In some situations, a woman with HIV may have a cesarean delivery (sometimes called a C-section) to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during delivery.Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programsprovides antiretroviral treatment to HIV-positive pregnant women to stop their infants from acquiring the virus.Guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIVThe 2015 guidelines recommend Option B+ where lifelong antiretroviral treatment is provided to all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV regardless of CD4 count or WHO clinical stage. Treatment should be maintained after delivery and completion of breastfeeding for life.Programs ofprevention (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy if replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmissionGuidelines for HIV-exposed infantsAll infants born to HIV-positive mothers should receive a course of antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible after birth. The treatment should be linked to the mothers course of antiretroviral drugs and the infant feeding method.Babies born to women with HIV receive HIV medicine for 4 to 6 weeks after birth. The HIV medicine reduces the risk of infection from any HIV that may have entered a baby’s body during childbirth.Breastfeeding - the infant should receive once-daily nevirapine from birth for six weeks.Replacement feeding - the infant should receive once-daily nevirapine (or twice-daily zidovudine) from birth for four to six weeks.The first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV is Cuba in 2015.VaccinationCurrently, there is no licensed Vaccinefor HIV or AIDSThe most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing.Even though there are no vaccines to prevent or cure HIV, people with HIV can benefit from vaccines against other diseases.Testing is underway on experimental vaccines to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, but no HIV vaccines are approved for use outside of clinical trials. The following vaccines are recommended for people with HIV: Hepatitis B Influenza (flu) Pneumococcal (pneumonia) Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). A single vaccine called Tdap protects adolescents and adults against the three diseases. Every 10 years, a repeat vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria (called Td) is recommended.

Dovato, a two-drug regimen (2DR), reduces exposure to the number of ARVs from the start of treatment, while still maintaining the efficacy and high barrier to resistance of a traditional DTG-based three-drug regimen. Deborah Waterhouse, CEO, ViiV Healthcare, said: “Building on our innovative portfolio of medicines, Dovato is powered by dolutegravir, an antiretroviral included in multiple combination therapies and the most prescribed integrase inhibitor in the world, 2 coupled with the established profile of lamivudine. With Dovato, the first complete, single-tablet, two-drug regimen for treatment-naïve adults, ViiV Healthcare is delivering what patients are requesting—a chance to treat their HIV-1 infection with as few drugs as possible, marking a significant step in HIV treatment.” The approval of Dovato is supported by the landmark global GEMINI 1 and 2 studies that included more than 1,400 HIV-1 infected adults. In these studies, DTG + 3TC demonstrated non-inferiority based on plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter (c/mL), a standard measure of HIV-1 control, at Week 48 when compared to a three-drug regimen of DTG and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/ emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), in treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected adults. The safety results for DTG + 3TC seen in GEMINI 1 and 2 were consistent with the product labelling for DTG and 3TC. No patient who experienced virologic failure in either treatment arm developed treatment-emergent resistance. Pedro Cahn, principal investigator for the GEMINI study program said: “People are now living longer with HIV and will spend a lifetime taking drugs to suppress their virus. The approval of the fixed dose combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine, a complete, single-tablet, two-drug regimen, marks a pivotal moment in the treatment of HIV-1. Treatment-naïve people living with the virus have a powerful option that delivers non-inferior efficacy to a dolutegravir-based three-drug regimen, allowing them to take fewer ARVs and get and remain suppressed.” Jeff Berry, Test Positive Aware Network (TPAN), said: “The approval of Dovato is a welcome paradigm shift, as it brings an innovative treatment approach to newly diagnosed adults with HIV-1. By exposing patients to fewer drugs at the start of treatment, the hope is to help address concerns arising from overall management of prolonged ARV therapy.” About Dovato (dolutegravir/ lamivudine) Dovato is approved as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults with no known antiretroviral treatment history and with no known substitutions associated with resistance to either dolutegravir or lamivudine. Dovato is a once-daily, single-tablet, two-drug regimen that combines the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) dolutegravir (Tivicay, 50 mg) with the nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) lamivudine (Epivir, 300 mg). Like a DTG-based three-drug regimen, Dovato uses only two drugs to inhibit the viral cycle at two different sites. INSTIs, like dolutegravir, inhibit HIV replication by preventing the viral DNA from integrating into the genetic material of human immune cells (T-cells). This step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and is also responsible for establishing chronic infection. Lamivudine is an NRTI that works by interfering with the conversion of viral RNA into DNA which in turn stops the virus from multiplying. GEMINI 1 and 2 study design GEMINI 1 (204861) and GEMINI 2 (205543) are duplicate, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority studies. These studies evaluate a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine compared with a three-drug, first-line regimen of DTG + TDF/FTC in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve adult participants with baseline HIV-1 viral loads up to 500,000 copies per milliliter. The trials are designed to study the efficacy and safety of once-daily dolutegravir and lamivudine compared to once-daily dolutegravir and the fixed-dose combination of TDF/FTC at 48 weeks in HIV-1-infected, ART-naïve adult participants. Important safety information The following ISI is based on the Highlights section of the Prescribing Information for Dovato. Please consult the full Prescribing Information for all the labeled safety information for Dovato. Warning: patients co-infected with hepatitis b virus (hbv) and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1): emergence of lamivudine-resistant hbv and exacerbations of HBV All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of HBV prior to or when initiating Dovato. Emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine-containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported. If Dovato is used in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, additional treatment should be considered for appropriate treatment of chronic HBV; otherwise, consider an alternative regimen. Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued lamivudine, a component of Dovato. Closely monitor hepatic function in these patients and, if appropriate, initiate anti-HBV treatment Contraindications Prior hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir or lamivudine. Coadministration with dofetilide. Warnings and precautions Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury, have been reported with dolutegravir. Discontinue Dovato immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop, as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life-threatening reaction. Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir-containing regimen. Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with Dovato. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended. Embryo-fetal toxicity may occur when used at the time of conception and in early pregnancy. Avoid use of Dovato at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of neural tube defects. Advise individuals of childbearing potential to use effective contraception. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy. Adverse reactions The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in ≥2% (in those receiving Dovato) were headache, diarrhea, nausea, insomnia, and fatigue. Drug interactions Dovato is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, coadministration with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is not recommended. Refer to the full prescribing information for important drug interactions with Dovato. Use in specific populations Pregnancy: Avoid use of Dovato at the time of conception through the first trimester due to the risk of neural tube defects. Lactation: Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission. Females and males of reproductive potential: Pregnancy testing and contraception are recommended in individuals of childbearing potential. Renal Impairment: Dovato is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min. Hepatic Impairment: Dovato is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score C).",{},"['dovato', 'hiv1', 'lamivudine', 'approves', 'dolutegravir', 'regimen', 'fda', 'antiretroviral', 'hbv', 'dtg', 'patients', 'treatment', 'dolutegravirlamivudine', 'infection']","The approval of the fixed dose combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine, a complete, single-tablet, two-drug regimen, marks a pivotal moment in the treatment of HIV-1.

"Gilead's HIV Franchise, CAR T therapy likely to propel growth",,,,,"Gileads HIV Franchise, CAR T therapy likely to propel growth Zacks; Yahoo Health Headquartered in Foster City, CA, Gilead is a biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and cardiovascular, hematology/oncology and inflammation/respiratory diseases. While the legacy HCV business has declined significantly of late due to competitive pressure from the likes of AbbVie ABBV, among others, the company’s HIV business has maintained momentum. Gilead is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive product portfolio. The company was the first to bring to market a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Additional STRs for HIV in the market include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild, among others. TAF-based products like Genvoya, Odefsey and Descovy are performing well with strong adoption in both the United States and Europe. The company received a major boost when the FDA approved its once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection. The approval, which comes ahead of the PDUFA date of Feb 12, 2018, significantly boosts Gilead’s HIV franchise. Biktarvy combines the novel, unboosted integrase strand transfer inhibitor (“INSTI”) bictegravir, with the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of the Descovy, (FTC/TAF). The approval of this new HIV therapy will pose stiff competition to GlaxoSmith’s GSK existing therapies, Tivicay and Triumeq.

The 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day,,,,,"The 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day Bangladesh continues to be a low prevalence country, albeit one with very high vulnerability Mohammed Abul Kalam, PhD This year’s theme for World AIDS Day, which marked its 30th anniversary on 1 December, 2018 was be “Know your status”. Significant progress has been made in the AIDS response since 1988, and today three in four people living with HIV know their status. But we still have miles to go, as the latest UNAIDS report shows, and that includes reaching people living with HIV who do not know their status and ensuring that they are linked to quality care and prevention services. HIV testing is essential for expanding treatment and ensuring that all people living with HIV can lead healthy and productive lives. It is also crucial to achieving the 90–90–90 targets and empowering people to make choices about HIV prevention so they can protect themselves and their loved ones. Unfortunately, many barriers to HIV testing remain. Stigma and discrimination still deters people from taking an HIV test. Access to confidential HIV testing is still an issue of concern. Many people still only get tested after becoming ill and symptomatic. The good news is that there are many new ways of expanding access to HIV testing. Self-testing, community-based testing and multidisease testing are all helping people to know their HIV status. HIV testing programmes must be expanded. For this, we need political will and investment, as well as novel and innovative approaches to HIV testing that are fully leveraged and taken to scale. Join us this World AIDS Day in raising awareness about the importance of knowing one’s status and calling for the removal of all barriers to accessing HIV testing (UNAIDS 2018). World AIDS Day originated at the 1988 World Summit of Ministers of Health on Programmes for AIDS Prevention. Since then, every year United Nations agencies, governments and civil society join together to campaign around specific themes related to AIDS. Bangladesh continues to be a low prevalence country, albeit one with very high vulnerability. Levels of risk behavior, in terms of high levels of unprotected sex with commercial partners, and unsafe injecting practices, make the country very vulnerable. Condom use is in Bangladesh is reportedly lowest in Asia, although the figures have been rising, due to NGO interventions. The porous borders with India and Myanmar, which are experiencing concentrated epidemics and high migration both within the country and across the borders, increase the vulnerability. Cross-cutting issues: Human rights: At its core, the response to AIDS is and has always been more than a fight against a disease – it is a fight for human rights. Violence, discrimination, stigmatization and persecution continue to mark the daily lives of many of the world’s most vulnerable people, increasing their risk of HIV acquisition and obstructing their access to essential health services. In some places, laws still criminalize HIV transmission, exposure and non-disclosure and being part of a key population. And health facilities, rather than acting as sanctuaries of care, are often where stigma and discrimination is most frequently experienced. With fewer than half of all people in need of treatment receiving ART, the right to health itself continues to be aspirational for most people living with HIV. I firmly believe that it is not enough to simply advocate for a human rights-based AIDS response. The protection and safe-guarding of human rights must be incorporated into every aspect of that response – from research to implementation, from policy to programming. Prioritizing gender transformation and inclusivity in every aspect of the response: Gender: The role of gender in defining the course of the AIDS epidemic and the world’s response to it is widely acknowledged, but insufficiently addressed in many aspects of research, policy and programme design and implementation. Women and girls continue to bear a disproportionate share of the HIV burden in some of the most highly affected regions, and transgender women are among those at risk of HIV exposure. Despite this, trans and intersex people continue to be largely excluded from most HIV research and programming. Lack of gender-transformative programming, high rates of intimate partner and gender-based violence, discriminatory laws and limited opportunities for women, as well as narrow conceptualizations of gender, gender norms and sexuality, have all contributed to the making of an epidemic that cannot be successfully fought without placing gender at the centre of our efforts. The Government should be committed to integrating gender across its programmes and initiatives by ensuring that a “gender lens” is incorporated into our work. This includes advancing a response that fully accounts for gender priority interventions that are inclusive of individuals across the full gender spectrum, including men and boys whose engagement is key to challenging entrenched gender norms and inequities that fuel the epidemic. Amplifying youth voices and empowering youth leaders: Youth: Recent progress in expanding access to ART for adults and significantly reducing the number of children born with HIV has obscured stagnation in the response for children and adolescents –adolescents are the only age group for whom AIDS-related deaths are increasing. Falling through the cracks between paediatric and adult services, young people must contend with a lack of services tailored to their specific needs. The impact of the epidemic is felt particularly acutely by young key populations and young women. Of all new HIV infections among adolescents in Asia, an estimated 95% occur among men who have sex with men, sex workers, and people who inject drug. In sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls account for 75% of new HIV infections among adolescents. The voices of youth are frequently stifled, and young people are not as meaningfully involved as they should be in the policy discussions that directly affect them. To improve the AIDS response for youth, their voices must be heard and listened to every step of the way – from research, to policy, to programme implementation. The right to health is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as enshrined in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This includes the right of everyone including people living with and affected by HIV, to the prevention and treatment of ill health, to make decisions about one’s own health and to be treated with respect and dignity and without discrimination. Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live, has a right to health, which is also dependent on adequate sanitation and housing, nutritious food, healthy working conditions and access to justice. The right to health is supported by, and linked to, a wider set of rights. Without the conditions to ensure access to justice, the right to a clean environment, the right to be free from violence or the right to education, for example, we cannot fulfill our right to health. Ending AIDS as a public health threat can only happen if these rights are placed at the centre of global health, so that quality health care is available and accessible for everyone and leaves no one behind. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the interdependence and complexity of a changing world and the imperative for global collective action. In shifting from so-called development for the poorest countries to sustainable development for all, the global agenda has expanded in scope and complexity. As a set of indivisible goals, the SDGs give all stakeholders a mandate for integration of efforts. The AIDS response is no exception: the epidemic cannot be ended without addressing the determinants of health and vulnerability, and the holistic needs of people at risk of and living with HIV. People living with HIV often live in fragile communities, and are most affected by discrimination, inequality and instability. Their concerns must be at the forefront of sustainable development efforts. By extension, lessons learned from the multisectoral, multi-stakeholder AIDS response are key to progress across the SDGs. The AIDS response has advanced such issues as the right to health, gender equality, health information systems, service delivery platforms, commodity access and security and social protection. The response has garnered substantial experience in addressing entrenched social norms, social exclusion and legal barriers that undermine health and development outcomes, and its investment approach is increasingly being adopted to accelerate gains across global health and development. The AIDS response can be a leader in leveraging strategic intersections with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while disseminating lessons learned from three decades of unprecedented progress. -Civil society activists, working closely with researchers and national regulatory authorities, promoted unprecedented investment in AIDS research and accelerated access to new medicines. This enabled new medicines and combinations to get to patients faster than ever before. Pressure from the global AIDS movement also ensured that the prices of new medicines were rapidly brought down to make them affordable to almost every country in the world. States should adhere to the following basic human rights obligations: (1) Respect: refrain from interfering with a person’s ability to fulfill their right to health (2) Protect: act to prevent third parties from interfering with a person’s ability to fulfill their right to health (3) Fulfill: adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, promotional and other measures to enable everyone to fully realize their right to health and put measures in place to actively inform and promote the fulfillment of the right to health (4) Almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals are linked some way to health(5) Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including ending AIDS as a public health threat, will depend heavily on ensuring the right to health for all; and (6) Only by placing rights at the centre of global health can quality health care be available and accessible for everyone, leaving no one behind.

It appears to be faster and less invasive that the method used currently to track down hidden HIV – and as such represents an important step in the direction of a potential cure. In recent decades, the life expectancy of HIV-infected patients has greatly improved thanks to antiretroviral therapy (ART), a combination of medicines which slow down the rate at which the virus is multiplying in the body. Along with robust preventive measures, ART has been instrumental in saving the lives of around 7.8 million people around the world in the last 15 years. ART suppresses the HIV infection to almost undetectable levels. However, if people stop taking the drugs, the virus can re-emerge. Dormant versions of the virus indeed hide in cellular reservoirs, ready to start replicating as soon as patients discontinue treatment. This is one of the most important challenges to efficiently treating HIV-infected individuals today to finding a cure. In a study now published in the journal Nature Medicine, scientists describe a new test which allowed them to identify the virus hiding in the body, and to assess if the detected virus could start replicating again if patients stopped taking their drugs. Today, clinicians use a test known as ""quantitative viral outgrowth assay"", or Q-VOA to do this. But they are confronted with a number a problems, in particular the fact that it only provides a minimal estimate of the size of the latent HIV reservoir. In addition, it is not very comfortable for patients as it requires a large volume of blood, and it is labour-intensive, time-consuming and expensive.n Source: International Business Times",{},"['hidden', 'replicating', 'art', 'hiv', 'bringing', 'powerful', 'start', 'detected', 'test', 'scientists', 'reservoirs', 'cure', 'closer', 'virus', 'patients', 'important', 'taking']","Scientists have developed a test sensitive enough to identify HIV lurking in a dormant state in the body.

It said there was no doubt prevention efforts to end the HIV epidemic were working. New HIV diagnoses in the UK fell by 17% from 2016 to 2017, with spread among gay and bisexual men declining. HIV charities said real progress was being made in the fight against HIV. Latest figures on HIV infections from PHE show that last year both England and the UK overall met three important targets of 90% set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAids). 92% of people living with HIV infection in the UK being diagnosed 98% of people diagnosed receiving treatment 97% of people receiving treatment, leaving them unable to pass on the infection Overall, 87% of people living with HIV in the UK were estimated to have an undetectable viral load and therefore be unable to infect others. Countries around the world were given a deadline of 2020 but the UK met the targets in 2017. The UKs success was down to more HIV testing, increased condom use and people starting their treatment sooner, PHE said. The availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep), a daily pill that disables HIV before it gets a stranglehold in the body, could also be a factor. The report says there has been a steady downward trend in new HIV diagnoses for several years and in HIV transmission among the group most affected by the virus - men who have sex with men. In 2017, there were 4,363 new cases of HIV in the UK - 3,236 in men - and nearly half were diagnosed at a late stage. Prof Noel Gill, head of sexually transmitted infections and HIV at Public Health England, said prevention efforts were working. But he said it was vital that people had an HIV test if they thought they were at risk because early diagnosis was key to stopping transmission. ""Our efforts must continue apace in order to eliminate HIV. ""Treatment for HIV is freely available and highly effective, enabling people to live a long, healthy life. ""There are now a variety of ways people can protect themselves from being infected with or passing on HIV, including use of condoms, Prep, regular HIV testing, and prompt initiation of antiretroviral treatment."" About 102,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV in the UK but some 8,000 (8%) are still thought to be unaware of their infection. Pivotal moment Ian Green, chief executive of Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was ""fantastic news"" that the UK had reached the UNs targets. But he said a new and ambitious target was now needed. ""This is far from the end and its time for us to be even more ambitious as we work towards ending new HIV transmissions entirely in the UK. ""Thats because were at a pivotal moment and must not jeopardise progress made by being complacent."" Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust said the UK was now a global leader on HIV. ""This is an extraordinary moment in the fight against HIV - in which everything seems possible.

Increases in viral load in both blood and semen were observed within two weeks of treatment interruption. Four weeks after stopping therapy, all participants had detectable virus in their semen. Viral load in semen peaked at approximately 16,000 copies/ml, high enough for transmission to sexual partners. “Early HIV-RNA rebound was observed in all participants in both compartments,” comment the authors. “This finding supports evidence of a very high risk of sexual transmission during self-driven cART breaks or during ATI [antiretroviral treatment interruption] stemming from clinical trials. Thus, prevention strategies for HIV-negative partners of HIV-infected participants undergoing ATI need reinforcement (counselling, condoms, PrEP).” There is now overwhelming evidence that people with an undetectable viral load when taking cART cannot transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Undetectable = Untransmittable has been widely endorsed and is now an important component of HIV prevention strategies. Continuous HIV therapy with high levels of adherence is needed to maintain sustained viral suppression. However, it is unclear how quickly and to what level viral load in the genital tract rebounds when cART is interrupted. This is an important question for people using HIV treatment as prevention. It also has implications for therapeutic and vaccine trials which typically involve interruption of cART. The ten HIV-positive men were taking part in a randomised, placebo-controlled vaccine study (VR102/ANRS149-LIGHT). They were randomised to receive an active vaccine or placebo between baseline and week 24 of the study, then interrupted antiretroviral treatment at week 36. Participants were able to resume cART at week 48 (or before) if viral load rebound occurred. The original studys primary outcome was viral load in blood plasma at week 48, following the 12-week interruption. Paired blood and semen samples were provided at week 36 (the time of the treatment interruption) and again at weeks 38, 40, 42, 44 and 48. These samples provided investigators with an opportunity to assess the timing and extent of viral rebound in both blood and semen after discontinuation of HIV therapy. Participants median was 42 years. They had been taking cART with viral suppression for a median duration of 44 months and had a median CD4 cell count of 768 cells/mm3. Four men received the experimental vaccine, the other six were randomised to take a placebo. All participants had a blood plasma viral load below 20 copies/ml when cART was interrupted at week 36. Rebound occurred within two weeks of interruption in eight of the participants, and all men had detectable viral load in blood within eight weeks. Maximum viral load was over 125,000 copies/ml, comparable to peak levels before initiation of HIV therapy. Similarly, viral load in semen was undetectable (below 60 copies/ml) in all ten people at the point when cART was interrupted. In four participants, viral load was detectable within two weeks. In four other participants, viral load in semen was detectable within four weeks. Samples were missing for the other two individuals. Viral load in semen peaked at over 15,000 copies/ml. HIV-DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear and non-sperm cells also increased after the treatment interruption. Phylogenetic analyses showed intermingling of HIV-RNA between blood and semen during the treatment interruption. This suggested that virus in semen was being replenished from blood cells, arguing against separate HIV replication in blood and semen. The findings have clear implications for the use of HIV treatment as prevention, showing that viral load can increase rapidly in semen to potentially infectious levels after interruption of cART. The investigators note that a transmission occurred from a study participant to his partner during the treatment interruption phase of the trial. “The rapid and intense HIV-RNA rebound observed very early in both blood and semen after ATI emphasizes the need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce the risk of sexual transmission during all the trials involving treatment interruptions,” conclude the authors.",{},"['participants', 'rebounds', 'levels', 'hiv', 'rapidly', 'breaks', 'interruption', 'weeks', 'load', 'blood', 'semen', 'treatment', 'cart', 'infectious', 'viral']","Increases in viral load in both blood and semen were observed within two weeks of treatment interruption. Viral load in semen peaked at approximately 16,000 copies/ml, high enough for transmission to sexual partners. However, it is unclear how quickly and to what level viral load in the genital tract rebounds when cART is interrupted. Maximum viral load was over 125,000 copies/ml, comparable to peak levels before initiation of HIV therapy.

'Dangerous complacency' to global HIV epidemic risks resurgence,,,,,"Dangerous complacency to global HIV epidemic risks resurgence Independent Online/ BBC A ""dangerous complacency"" in the response to the global HIV pandemic is risking a resurgence of the disease, according to a report. Experts said a stalling of HIV funding in recent years was endangering efforts to control the illness. As things stand, the world is no longer on course to end the pandemic by 2030 - a target agreed by UN member states, say experts in The Lancet. They call for urgent changes in how the disease is treated and controlled. Situation has stagnated About 37 million people worldwide live with HIV or Aids. And there are an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. New cases of HIV/Aids have been falling in recent years. But the Lancet Commission said the fall was happening too slowly to reach the UNAids target of 500,000 new infections by 2020. While HIV rates were falling overall, they remained persistent in marginalised groups, younger people - particularly women - and in developing countries, all of whom were less likely to access treatment, the commission said. Experts said HIV funding had remained flat in recent years, at about £14.7bn - roughly £5.4bn short of the estimated amount needed to achieve the UNAids targets. Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, president of the International Aids Society and professor at University of Cape Town, South Africa, said: ""Despite the remarkable progress of the HIV response, the situation has stagnated in the past decade. ""Reinvigorating this work will be demanding - but the future health and wellbeing of millions of people require that we meet this challenge."" The Lancet Commission also called for more collaboration between health professionals and for HIV treatment to become better incorporated into other areas of healthcare. This would mean an end to HIV ""exceptionalism"", where specific funding and services have been provided for HIV alone, and could include combining HIV screening with screening for other non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. In India, for example, if HIV testing and treatments were combined with those for syphilis among women sex workers and gay men it could reduce the number of new HIV cases at a national-level by 7% between 2018 and 2028, the report estimated. ""Health systems must be designed to meet the needs of the people they serve, including having the capacity to address multiple health problems simultaneously,"" Prof Chris Beyrer said. ""No-one can be left behind in our efforts to achieve sustainable health.""

 | theindependentbd.com","People living with HIV who adhere to antiretroviral therapy but smoke cigarettes are 10 times more likely to die from lung cancer than from AIDS, a study led by an Indian-origin scientist warns. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the US found that smoking and HIV together put people at risk of developing lung cancer at a rate even higher than that among smokers not infected with HIV. They found that nearly 25 per cent of people who adhere well to anti-HIV medications but continue to smoke will die from lung cancer. Among smokers who quit at age 40, only about six per cent will die of lung cancer. They also found that people with HIV who take antiviral medicines but who also smoke are from six to 13 times more likely to die from lung cancer than from HIV/AIDS, depending on the intensity of smoking and their sex. ""Heavy smokers are at even higher risk for lung cancer, with risks of lung cancer death approaching 30 per cent,"" researchers said. When the researchers focused on people who do not perfectly follow recommended HIV treatment - and who are thus at greater risk of dying from HIV/AIDS - lung cancer was still estimated to kill more than 15 per cent of smokers, they said. ""Smoking and HIV are a particularly bad combination when it comes to lung cancer,"" said Krishna Reddy, from Massachusetts General Hospital. Using a computer simulation model of HIV, researchers estimated the risk of lung cancer among people living with HIV in the US based on whether they are current, former, or have never smoked. How many cigarettes per day they smoke - or smoked for former smokers - and whether they consistently take antiviral medications. They also accounted for the risks of other diseases, like heart disease, that are increased by smoking.The study was published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.PTI.

targets ‘hidden’ HIV | theindependentbd.com","In a case that investigators say is a first, a lung cancer drug unmasked and then attacked the kind of HIV-infected cells that standard antiretroviral therapy has been unable to touch. The finding was reported on Dec. 1, which is also World AIDS Day, in the Annals of Oncology. While one AIDS expert said the findings were promising, she noted the drug did not ""cure"" the patient of HIV. The potential breakthrough centers on the experience of a single 51-year-old French man, who has been receiving treatment in Paris for advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer for the past year. The patient -- who is also HIV-positive -- had undergone both surgery and chemotherapy for tumors that had initially been diagnosed in 2015, before he experienced a relapse in 2016. So, French clinicians gave him the cancer treatment nivolumab (Opdivo). The drug is commonly used for advanced melanoma and kidney cancer, as well as non-small cell lung cancer. When the patient began his nivolumab treatment, his HIV status -- first diagnosed in 1995 -- was characterized as ""undetectable."" But like all HIV patients in his situation, that meant simply that all viral activity related to HIV was dormant. Such dormancy is far preferable to an active viral status. But it is not a cure, because the patients body is not completely clear of the virus. In fact, dormant reservoirs of HIV-infected cells typically lurk throughout the immune system of such patients, hidden (from both the immune system and antiretroviral treatment) across an array of organs, such as the bone marrow, genital tract and even the brain. Should antiretroviral treatment be halted for some reason, these hidden cells begin to replicate and spread. ""Latent HIV reservoirs are established during the earliest stage of HIV infection and throughout the course of the disease,"" study author Dr. Jean-Philippe Spano explained in a news release. ""When a latently infected cell is reactivated, the cell begins to produce HIV again."" But, ""increasingly, researchers have been looking into the use of certain drugs that appear to reactivate the latent HIV-infected cells,"" noted Spano, who is head of the medical oncology department at Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital AP-HP. ""This could have the effect of making them visible to the immune system, which could then attack them."" Enter nivolumab. The French cancer patient started receiving the cancer drug once every two weeks, starting in December 2016. Spanos team noted that the patients previously undetectable HIV status became detectable, as his HIV levels began to climb. The rise continued up until 45 days following the launch of his cancer therapy, and was accompanied by a similar bump in the activity of his T-cells, which serve as the bodys fighter cells when an immunity threat is detected. By day 45, the patients HIV levels started to fall back down, and by day 120 levels of the formerly hidden reservoirs of HIV had experienced ""a drastic and persistent decrease,"" the study team noted. The bottom line: Nivolumab had apparently woken up the dormant and invisible HIV reservoirs, and by doing so exposed them to the patients immune defenses, which in turn attacked and destroyed the unmasked virus. Still, Spano and his colleagues cautioned that other patients in a similar situation had not responded in the same fashion, and that the finding would need to be replicated in others. ""But it could have implications for HIV patients, both with and without cancer, as it can work on HIV reservoirs and tumor cells independently,"" Spano said. ""The absence of side effects in this patient is also good news, and suggests this could be an optimum treatment for HIV-infected patients with cancer.""

Symtuza combines the proven high barrier to resistance of darunavir with a formulation designed for improved tolerability and the convenience of an STR. Symtuza has a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of post-treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B. “As clinicians, we may not always have the full picture of a patient’s health or their risk for developing resistance when making treatment decisions. In key Phase 3 clinical trials, Symtuza successfully treated those who were starting therapy, as well as those who were stably suppressed on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy – including patients with more complex treatment histories or previous virologic failure – demonstrating its potential as an important new treatment option for a wide variety of patients,” said Joseph Eron, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Director, Clinical Core, University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research, Chapel Hill, N.C. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines1 recommend darunavir-based therapies for treatment-naïve patients in certain clinical situations, including when a person may have uncertain adherence or when ARV treatment should be initiated before resistance test results are available. “Many people living with HIV struggle to adhere to their medication, which can lead to the development of drug resistance and potentially cause their medication – or even an entire class of medications – to stop working,” continued Dr. Eron. Symtuza received FDA approval based on data from two 48-week, non-inferiority, pivotal Phase 3 studies that assessed the safety and efficacy of Symtuza versus a control regimen in adults with no prior ARV history (AMBER) and in virologically suppressed adults (EMERALD). Results from both trials demonstrated that Symtuza was effective and well-tolerated, with up to 95 percent achieving or maintaining virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50c/mL). AMBER compared Symtuza to darunavir/cobicistat (D/C) plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF). The results, presented at the 16th European AIDS Conference in October 2017, demonstrated similar viral suppression rates (HIV-1 RNA <50c/mL at 48 weeks – per FDA Snapshot analysis) between the darunavir-based STR vs. control (91.4% vs 88.4% respectively) and low virologic failure rates (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL; 4.4% vs. 3.3%) at 48 weeks. Symtuza also showed less bone loss (in a sub-study) and a significant improvement in markers of renal function versus control. The long-term clinical significance of these bone mineral density (BMD) changes is not known. Overall, Symtuza was well-tolerated, with fewer discontinuations due to an adverse event (AE; 2% vs. 4%) versus control, only one grade 3 adverse reaction and no grade 4 adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of subjects were diarrhea, rash, nausea, fatigue, headache, abdominal discomfort and flatulence. The EMERALD study, presented at IDWeek in October 2017, compared Symtuza to continuing treatment with a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) plus emtricitabine and TDF. The trial found there were low virologic failure rates (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 c/mL; 0.8% vs. 0.5%) and high virologic suppression rates (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL; 94.9% vs. 93.7%) according to FDA Snapshot analysis at Week 48, with no patients discontinuing the study due to virologic failure. Switching to Symtuza demonstrated improvement in BMD (in a sub-study) and a significant improvement in some markers of renal function versus control. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known. The safety profile was similar to that of those patients with no prior ARV treatment history, and the percentage of participants who discontinued due to AEs, regardless of severity, was 1%. “For more than 25 years, Janssen has been committed to the research and development of transformational medical innovation across the continuum of HIV care. The FDA approval of Symtuza marks another important milestone in our quest to address real-world clinical challenges, combat HIV drug resistance and meet the diverse needs of those living with HIV,” said Brian Woodfall, M.D., Global Head of Late Development, Infectious Diseases, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV. “There is more to be done in our fight to make HIV history, and we will not stop here. We will continue our efforts to advance treatment and remain steadfast in our pursuit of fulfilling the dream of a preventive HIV vaccine.” The recommended dosage of Symtuza is one tablet taken once-daily with food. Symtuza is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL per minute or those with severe hepatic impairment. According to the Prescribing Information, prior to or when initiating treatment with Symtuza, patients should be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and renal function, and renal function should be monitored as clinically appropriate during therapy. Symtuza has also been approved by the European Commission (EC) and Health Canada for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with body weight of at least 40 kg. European approval allows Janssen to market Symtuza in all member states of the European Union and the European Economic Area. Janssen plans additional regulatory filings in other markets worldwide, and additional Symtuza data, including data from an ongoing Phase 3 rapid initiation study (DIAMOND) will be presented at AIDS 2018 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands in late July.

He performs business at a local market, taking advantage of the government’s lax monitoring of Rohingyas living outside refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. Like Rahman, Hasina Khatun (name changed), 45, and her 16-year-old daughter are living in Chittagong city’s Kalamia Bazar. They are being treated for HIV by a local NGO. They had entered Bangladesh in 2016. Many Rohingyas, who have entered Bangladesh with HIV, are living in different Chittagong areas like Satkania, Loagahara and Chokoria upazilas, thanks to lack of government vigilance. Sources say the Rohingya refugees are fanning out to different parts of the country with the help of middlemen. According to the International Organisation of Migration, 5,36,000 Rohingyas have fled violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine state and crossed over to Bangladesh, which was already hosting over three lakh Rohingyas before August 25 when the recent influx began. Ashar Alo Society (AAS), an NGO, has enlisted 65 HIV-affected Rohingyas, most of whom are male. Of them, 30 were detected after the August 25 influx, 11 were detected in 2016, and 24 before 2016. Ten of these people are already dead. “Of the newly identified 30 HIV-affected Rohingyas, 26 are now in Cox’s Bazar and four in the Chittagong Medical College Hospital. Of these Rohingyas, four are male children, one female child, and 25 are adults,” said Hafiz Ahmed, HTC counsellor of AAS in Chittagong. According to AAS data, some 139 HIV-affected patients are currently in Cox’s Bazar. Of these, 55 are Rohingyas. About 539 HIV patients have been found in the Chittagong region alone. Myanmar is one of the 35 highest-alert HIV-prone countries of the world. According to UNAIDS, there are 2.3 lakh HIV patients in Myanmar and 7,800 people have died due to the infection. As the number of HIV-affected is rising, locals and health officials fear the spread of HIV/AIDS in the refugee camps and the adjacent areas of the Chittagong region. The risk is particularly high as these patients are scattered in different areas of Chittagong. “We have some HIV-affected Rohingyas, who earlier came to live outside of the camps and take regular counselling and medicines from us,” said Provash Paul, HTC counsellor in Cox’s Bazar. “As many HIV-affected Rohingyas have already spread to different parts of the country, there is a possibility of the disease spreading among our people. The government should bring the Rohingyas, who have spread out, to the fixed camps. The government should keep a strict eye on HIV-affected Rohingyas as they should not come into contact with our people,” said Mahamudul Haq Chowdhury, founder president of the Rohingya Refugee Repatriation Movement Committee. “At the beginning, our law enforcement agencies had no control over Rohingyas. As a result, they managed to spread outside of the camps. For our national interest, they should be brought to the camps,” added Haq. However, government officials working in Cox’s Bazar are surprised at the rising number of HIV patients. The health ministry has extended logistics support in Cox’s Bazar under the National AIDS/STD Programme. This included giving kits to detect HIV patients at Rohingya refugee camps, where over 35 medical teams are currently working. Contacted, Dr Md Belal Hossain, deputy director of the National AIDS/STD Programme under the health and family planning ministry, told The Independent: “All the HIV-affected Rohingyas brought under treatment either live in the camps or outside them. The HIV-affected Rohingyas have not been isolated. They are given treatment along with Bangladeshi HIV-affected people.”",{},"['bazar', 'camps', 'freely', 'spread', 'hiv', 'chittagong', 'refugee', 'rohingyas', 'hivinfected', 'patients', 'hivaffected', 'locals', 'mingling', 'coxs']","He performs business at a local market, taking advantage of the government’s lax monitoring of Rohingyas living outside refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar.

Structural analysis of one such antibody, 8ANC195, revealed a new conformation of the envelope protein. The image above shows the X-ray crystal structure of 8ANC195 in complex with the gp120 subunit of the envelope protein. The background shows schematic representations of HIV-1 virus particles studded with envelope proteins being recognized by 8ANC195 antibodies. Proteins called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are a promising key to the prevention of infection by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. bNAbs have been found in blood samples from some HIV patients whose immune systems can naturally control the infection. These antibodies may protect a patients healthy cells by recognizing a protein called the envelope spike, present on the surface of all HIV strains and inhibiting, or neutralizing, the effects of the virus. Now Caltech researchers have discovered that one particular bNAb may be able to recognize this signature protein, even as it takes on different conformations during infection—making it easier to detect and neutralize the viruses in an infected patient. The work, from the laboratory of Pamela Bjorkman, Centennial Professor of Biology, was published in the September 10 issue of the journal Cell. The process of HIV infection begins when the virus comes into contact with human immune cells called T cells that carry a particular protein, CD4, on their surface. Three-part (or ""trimer"") proteins called envelope spikes on the surface of the virus recognize and bind to the CD4 proteins. The spikes can be in either a closed or an open conformation, going from closed to open when the spike binds to CD4. The open conformation then triggers fusion of the virus with the target cell, allowing the HIV virus to deposit its genetic material inside the host cell, forcing it to become a factory for making new viruses that can go on to infect other cells. The bNAbs recognize the envelope spike on the surface of HIV, and most known bNAbs only recognize the spike in the closed conformation. Although the only target of neutralizing antibodies is the envelope spike, each bNAb actually functions by recognizing just one specific target, or epitope, on this protein. Some targets allow more effective neutralization of the virus, and, therefore, some bNAbs are more effective against HIV than others. In 2014, Bjorkman and her collaborators at Rockefeller University reported initial characterization of a potent bNAb called 8ANC195 in the blood of HIV patients whose immune systems could naturally control their infections. They also discovered that this antibody could neutralize the HIV virus by targeting a different epitope than any other previously identified bNAb. In the work described in the recent Cell paper, they investigated how 8ANC195 functions—and how its unique properties could be beneficial for HIV therapies. ""In Pamelas lab we use X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to study protein-protein interactions on a molecular level,"" says Louise Scharf, a postdoctoral scholar in Bjorkmans laboratory and the first author on the paper. ""We previously were able to define the binding site of this antibody on a subunit of the HIV envelope spike, so in this study we solved the three-dimensional structure of this antibody in complex with the entire spike, and showed in detail exactly how the antibody recognizes the virus."" What they found was that although most bNAbs recognize the envelope spike in its closed conformation, 8ANC195 could recognize the viral protein in both the closed conformation and a partially open conformation. ""We think its actually an advantage if the antibody can recognize these different forms,"" Scharf says. The most common form of HIV infection is when a virus in the bloodstream attaches to a T cell and infects the cell. In this instance, the spikes on the free-floating virus would be predominantly in the closed conformation until they made contact with the host cell. Most bNAbs could neutralize this virus. However, HIV also can spread directly from one cell to another. In this case, because the antibody already is attached to the host cell, the spike is in an open conformation. But 8ANC195 could still recognize and attach to it. A potential medical application of this antibody is in so-called combination therapies, in which a patient is given a cocktail of several antibodies that work in different ways to fight off the virus as it rapidly changes and evolves. ""Our collaborators at Rockefeller have studied this extensively in animal models, showing that if you administer a combination of these antibodies, you greatly reduce how much of the virus can escape and infect the host,"" Scharf says. ""So 8ANC195 is one more antibody that we can use therapeutically; it targets a different epitope than other potent antibodies, and it has the advantage of being able to recognize these multiple conformations."" The idea of bNAb therapeutics might not be far from a clinical reality. Scharf says that the same collaborators at Rockefeller University are already testing bNAbs in a human treatment in a clinical trial. Although the initial trial will not include 8ANC195, the antibody may be included in a combination therapy trial in the near future, Scharf says. Furthermore, the availability of complete information about how 8ANC195 binds to the viral spike will allow Scharf, Bjorkman, and their colleagues to begin engineering the antibody to be more potent and able to recognize more strains of HIV. ""In addition to supporting the use of 8ANC195 for therapeutic applications, our structural studies of 8ANC195 have revealed an unanticipated new conformation of the HIV envelope spike that is relevant to understanding the mechanism by which HIV enters host cells and bNAbs inhibit this process,"" Bjorkman says.

They also discovered that this antibody could neutralize the HIV virus by targeting a different epitope than any other previously identified bNAb. These results were published in a journal article titled ""Broadly Neutralizing Antibody 8ANC195 Recognizes Closed and Open States of HIV-1 Env.""",http://www.theindependentbd.com/arcprint/details/16658/2015-09-21
Scientists identify two potential new drug targets for treatment of HIV,,,,,"Scientists identify two potential new drug targets for treatment of HIV News Medical Life Sciences Johns Hopkins scientists report they have identified two potential new drug targets for the treatment of HIV. The finding is from results of a small, preliminary study of 19 people infected with both HIV-; the virus that causes AIDS-; and the hepatitis C virus. The study revealed that two genes-; CMPK2 and BCLG, are selectively activated in the presence of type 1 interferon, a drug once used as the first line of treatment against hepatitis C. ""Weve known that HIV worsens our ability to treat hepatitis C with type 1 interferon, but why that was has been unclear. In some way the viruses interactions with each other and with the treatment seemed at the root of the failure,"" says Ashwin Balagopal, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. To study the relationship, the researchers enrolled 19 participants-; 15 men and four women, all over the age of 20-; from several Baltimore clinics, including the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinic and a Baltimore City Health Department sexually transmitted disease clinic. All participants were diagnosed with chronic HIV and hepatitis C infections. The participants received injections of interferon to treat their hepatitis C. Before and after each treatment, the researchers took blood samples to measure the amount of both hepatitis C and HIV present in the blood. After one week of treatment, the participants had on average 10 times less HIV in their blood. ""This told us that the interferon we were using to treat hepatitis C was working to control HIV as well, but we needed to investigate how it was accomplishing this,"" says Balagopal. To do this, Balagopal and his colleagues studied the patients CD4 T cells-; the immune cells most suppressed and affected by HIV-; in the lab. In those cells, the researchers measured the levels of numerous gene products before and after interferon treatment. They identified 99 genes with higher levels of expression after interferon treatment. Of these genes, the researchers found that two, CMPK2 and BCLG, had not been previously linked to HIV. Both genes are thought to be involved in the processes that guide how cells divide. The researchers then infected lab-grown human cells (not from the 19 patients) with HIV to further study the interactions between the two genes and interferon. First, they engineered human immune cells to render them unable to produce the protein made by the CMPK2 gene. They then added interferon and tested the cells HIV levels, finding that control cells with functioning CMPK2 had 10 times less HIV than cells in which CMPK2 was blocked. On the other hand, BCLG normally has very low expression levels, according to the investigators, and is difficult to eliminate from human cells. So the researchers opted to increase its expression by adding more BCLG genes to HeLa cells infected with HIV in the lab. The researchers then again added interferon to the cells and 48 hours later, the cells engineered to have more BCLG expression had half the amount of HIV compared to cells with normal BCLG expression. This seems to indicate that CMPK2 and BCLG play a role in interferons ability to suppress HIV, according to Balagopal, and potentially could serve as targets for new drug approaches to HIV treatment, particularly in people who are co-infected. The researchers caution that the level of HIV suppression they saw in these interferon experiments is not large enough to warrant interferons use as a standalone treatment. More than 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV and 25 percent of them are estimated to be co-infected with the hepatitis C virus. The researchers say nearly one-third of the HIV patients in their Baltimore clinics also have hepatitis C. Hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver and, though it can take years for symptoms to arise, can cause nausea, weight loss, cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure. Complications from this virus are accelerated in people co-infected with HIV. In the future, Balagopal hopes to better understand the genes and their roles in HIV suppression by investigating the cellular pathways with which they interact. He also hopes to examine the genes effects on HIVs ability to hide for decades within cells-; a factor that has stalled scientists efforts to cure HIV infections.",{},"['cells', 'hiv', 'hepatitis', 'interferon', 'targets', 'researchers', 'scientists', 'bclg', 'cmpk2', 'c', 'potential', 'treatment', 'identify', 'drug', 'genes']","Scientists identify two potential new drug targets for treatment of HIVNews Medical Life SciencesJohns Hopkins scientists report they have identified two potential new drug targets for the treatment of HIV.

 | theindependentbd.com","Does being at high risk for HIV mean youre less likely to get the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine? New research suggests thats so. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS, while HPV can cause cervical, anal and other cancers. HPV infection is common, and healthy people often clear it from the body without developing cancer. But HIV infection weakens the immune system, making it more difficult to fight off HPV, explained study author Lisa Wigfall. She is an assistant professor in the division of health education at Texas A&M University, in College Station. To assess HPV vaccination rates among people at high risk for HIV infection, the researchers analysed data from more than 486,000 adults who took part in the 2016 US Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Of those, about 16,500 (3.4 per cent) were classified as being at high risk for HIV infection due to using injection drugs and/or engaging in risky sex. From complete data available for 416 of those people, the researchers found that very few were fully vaccinated against HPV. Only about one quarter of gay/bisexual males aged 18 to 33 had started the three-dose HPV vaccine series, and about 6 per cent had completed it. Only about one quarter of high-risk heterosexual women aged 18 to 36 had completed the three-dose HPV series, and only 11 per cent of high-risk heterosexual men aged 18 to 29 had started the three-dose HPV series, the findings showed. None of the transgender men and women and gender-nonconforming individuals in the study had started HPV vaccination, the researchers found. HPV vaccination rates were also much lower among black respondents than any other racial/ethnic group, according to the study authors. The findings were presented Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting, in Atlanta. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. ""It was alarming that almost all non-Hispanic blacks in the study were unvaccinated, especially given the disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS among this minority group,"" Wigfall said in an AACR news release. One possible reason for the low rate of HPV vaccination in high-risk adults is that recommendations for people living with HIV were issued several years after the HPV vaccine first became available to the general population, Wigfall noted. And for some groups of people at high risk for HIV infection -- such as gay/bisexual men or transgender individuals -- health care providers may fail to discuss the connection between high-risk sex and HIV/HPV co-infection, she added. ""Gender and sexual orientation are important topics that should not preclude us from identifying and targeting HPV vaccination efforts among high-risk populations,"" Wigfall said.

First randomised trial of 'kick and kill' approach to HIV cure leaves puzzles to be solved,,,,,"First randomised trial of kick and kill approach to HIV cure leaves puzzles to be solved medicalxpress Researchers have reported the results of the first randomised clinical trial to test a novel strategy involving waking up and then killing the sleeping HIV that is hiding in the body using an experimental approach known as kick and kill. Led by Imperial College London, the University of Oxford, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, and the University of Cambridge, the RIVER study aimed to improve on current care by eradicating HIV from the body, which would represent a major step forward in the search for a cure. Although investigators found no difference in effect between those participants who received the active kick and kill therapy and those who had standard treatment, they say the trial paves the way for testing different combinations of therapies to tackle the HIV that persists in patients who receive antiretroviral treatment (ART). The trial demonstrates how researchers are looking beyond current therapies which, despite revolutionising the lives of people living with HIV, are not a cure and have to be taken for life. The RIVER study, which ran from 2015 to 2018 in London and Brighton, tested the kick and kill approach in 60 men recently diagnosed with HIV and who had the virus under control by taking ART. Despite having undetectable levels of HIV in their blood, patients on ART are not cured. If they stop taking ART, the virus returns from hiding places in the body known as reservoirs. This has led researchers to propose that a possible cure for HIV would be to target these reservoirs, force HIV out of hiding and then kill it. To test this idea, RIVER used two medicines on top of the standard ART treatment. First, two vaccines to coach the bodys immune system to recognise and destroy HIV, and second, a drug called vorinostat (also used for managing cancer) that would wake up the reservoir cells that HIV is hiding in and force the virus to reveal itself and face the immune system. This approach to an HIV cure is called kick and kill - the kick is delivered from vorinostat, and the kill comes from the bodys own immune system killer cells that have been trained by the vaccines. To claim success in the RIVER proof of concept trial, the researchers said that those receiving the kick and kill drugs should experience a significant fall in levels of HIV in the reservoir cells, known as CD4 T cells. However, when the results were first unveiled to researchers in April 2018, they found that the half of trial participants given the kick and kill drugs in addition to ART had similar levels of infected reservoir cells compared to those who only received standard ART therapy. The RIVER study leaders report these initial findings today in a Late Breaker session at the International AIDS Societys annual meeting in Amsterdam, Netherlands (AIDS 2018). The results of the study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. RIVER Chief Investigator, Professor Sarah Fidler of Imperial College London said: ""In the RIVER study, we found that all the separate parts of the kick and kill approach worked as expected and were safe. The vaccine worked on the immune system, the kick drug behaved as we expected it to, and the ART worked in suppressing viral load in the body, but the study has shown that this particular set of treatments together didnt add up to a potential cure for HIV, based on what weve seen so far."" ""For those who have access to it, ART brings amazing success in managing HIV but people have to take it for most of their lives. We have to think about other, sustainable alternatives, and a cure or at least some form of remission is a key goal. ""Finding an HIV cure means orchestrating a lot of things. We have to generate new ideas and turn them into trials that will give meaningful results, we have to agree what research tests will tell us whether things are working or not, we need to very carefully monitor study participants and most importantly we need to make sure any trial intervention is safe. RIVER achieved all these things but sadly not the evidence of a possible HIV cure yet."" Based on the findings, the study doctors have told participants that they cannot recommend that all study participants receive the kick and kill drugs as well as their ART and that the trial did not find evidence to recommend that any participants could safely stop taking their ART. Looking forward to possible next steps, the RIVER co-principal investigator and scientific lead, Professor John Frater of the University of Oxford said: ""We need to think about why we didnt see an effect. The important thing to realise is that despite these disappointing results, it does not mean that the basis of the approach is wrong. This is the very first randomised study of the kick and kill concept in humans and the field now needs to work together to explore how better and more effective agents can have an impact on the HIV reservoir while remaining safe. ""It is possible that the combinations of drugs we used werent quite right, but for this first study we didnt want to compromise on safety by using stronger agents that might work better but could cause toxicity to the participants. It is possible that vorinostat was not quite potent enough to wake up as much HIV as was needed for the newly trained immune system to recognise. Equally, it is possible that a different sort of immune response to the one we induced is needed to target the HIV reservoir. All of these possibilities need to be teased out and considered to guide our next move in searching for an HIV cure."" The vaccines used in RIVER, known as ChAdV63.HIVconsv and MVA.HIVconsv, were highly effective at inducing HIV specific immune responses in the active group. Follow-up research may include giving further boosts of this vaccination together with a different kick drug or possibly using the next generation of these vaccines that are now being trialled in other studies. RIVER was run by CHERUB, a UK collaboration of five universities pooling their expertise to develop an HIV cure. CHERUB is supported by the National Institute for Health Research and brings together HIV researchers at Imperial College London, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, and Kings College London. RIVER was funded by the Medical Research Council, UK and the industry partners, MSD and GSK. RIVER was the first HIV cure study to use a randomised controlled approach, and the authors urge that this should be repeated in future HIV cure trials. Professor Abdel Babiker of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, said: ""Although the results are disappointing, they are unambiguous because of the randomisation and completeness of follow up assessments. Because ART is so effective at reducing viral load, without the randomised control group of participants taking ART alone to compare against, we couldnt have been so confident in knowing whether the kick and kill drugs had made any impact. Its important that future HIV cure trials follow this approach and compare their outcomes to an ART-only group."" During its three years, RIVER benefitted from outstanding commitment from its 60 participants. There was 100% attendance at the primary endpoint study visits, and no participants were lost from the study. In the experience of the doctors and researchers, this was extraordinary and reflects new and deeper levels of commitment from participants. ""They take time off work, they come for lots of visits and tests, and they are an amazingly committed group of people,"" said Professor Fidler. ""They are not just volunteers, they are active advocates for support and they push us to go further all the time. They are helping to define where this research can go next and they are the real pioneers of new treatments."" A participant in the trial said: ""You can be hopeful, but you must be realistic when you take part in a trial. The results from previous trials, the way RIVER was designed and the people running and supporting it, all gave me confidence that it was the right thing to do to take part. So, the initial results are disappointing because of course everyone would have liked to have seen some difference between the control and the active groups. We will have to wait and see what the next move is, but we cant hold back now in the search for a functional cure."" ""Its remarkable that nobody dropped out of the trial. It had outstanding commitment from participants because people want to see an HIV cure happen and can see that being involved is the way we are going to push the boundaries back."" Damian Kelly, RIVER community advisory board leader and Director of Patient Advocacy Alliance, said: ""The cost of HIV treatment globally and the new infection rates globally mean that we have to drive towards a cure for HIV or some in-between point such as remission. ""Everyone involved in RIVER—the participants, the clinic staff who have such a critical role in keeping participants engaged and supported, the doctors, the lab technicians and the scientists—everyone should be proud that they were involved in the first randomised controlled HIV cure trial."" ""Im confident that not an ounce of effort that has gone into the RIVER trial will be wasted as these results will help to direct and inform the design of future trials and move us closer towards the goal of a cure.""

HIV is often diagnosed late, when it has already ravaged the immune system, leaving people vulnerable. To counter this, researchers tried prescribing a cocktail of drugs at the start of HIV therapy to treat ""opportunistic"" infections. The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed deaths fell by 27%. HIV itself does not kill. Instead, it leaves the body exposed to dangerous bacterial infections such as tuberculosis or pneumonia as well as fungi that can cause cryptococcal meningitis. But starting antiretroviral therapy poses risks too. The drugs restore the immune system, but if it suddenly realises there is an infection, then it can launch such a strong attack - in the brain, for example - that this can occasionally be deadly too. So, the trial gave patients with a CD count - used to measure the health of the immune system - below 100 a mix of drugs, including antibiotics, alongside standard antiretroviral medication for HIV. Patients with a CD count below 50 are six times more likely to die within 24 weeks than those with a count above 100. Life-saver The trial was conducted in Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Kenya and involved 1,805 patients over the age of five. Normally, more than one in 10 would have died within weeks of diagnosis. But the results showed the preventative therapy led to: deaths falling by 27% tuberculosis falling by 28% cryptococcal disease falling by 62% candidiasis falling by 58% hospitalisation falling by 17% Overall, three lives were saved for every 100 treated. One of the study authors, Prof Diana Gibb, from the UKs MRC Clinical Trials Unit, told the BBC News website: ""You might save over 10,000 deaths [globally], but also prevent tuberculosis disease, cryptococcal meningitis and hospital admissions, which are costly. ""So, I think it could have quite a big impact and could be a relatively simple additional intervention."" The medicine is $5 (£3.80) more expensive per patient than standard treatment. Back to the future And because every patient is prescribed all the drugs, no expensive tests for each infection are needed. Speaking to the BBC at the IAS Conference on HIV Science in Paris, Prof Gibb said the approach was ""very cost-effective throughout Africa"" and ""we think this should become part of guidelines"". Dr Carl Dieffenbach, the director of the division of Aids within the US National Institutes of Health, said the idea reminded him of the early era of HIV/Aids, when there was more emphasis on treating opportunistic infections. He told the BBC News website: ""Its logical, and its back to the future in a good way. ""I think its the best possible medicine you could be doing, the challenge for health departments around the world is theyve largely felt they could get out of dealing with the opportunistic infections. ""They cant neglect this population of patients, its not enough to just put them on antiretroviral therapy."" Many patients on the trial had appeared healthy when they were diagnosed with HIV. Despite their average CD4 count being just 36, half of them had showed no symptoms. Drs Nathan Ford and Meg Doherty, from the World Health Organization, said: ""[There needs to be a] renewed focus to respond to the needs of patients with advanced HIV infection who are at high risk for illness and death.""

Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are from Gilead Sciences and rilpivirine is from Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson Johnson (Janssen). Odefsey is Gileads second TAF-based regimen to receive FDA approval and represents the smallest pill of any single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. Odefsey is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 12 years of age and older who have no antiretroviral treatment history and HIV-1 RNA levels less than or equal to 100,000 copies per mL. Odefsey is also indicated as replacement for a stable antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) for at least six months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of Odefsey. No dosage adjustment of Odefsey is required in patients with estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL per minute. Odefsey has a boxed warning in its product label regarding the risks of lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, and post treatment acute exacerbation of hepatitis B. TAF is a novel targeted prodrug of tenofovir that has demonstrated high antiviral efficacy similar to and at a dose less than one-tenth that of Gileads Viread (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, TDF). TAF has also demonstrated improvement in surrogate laboratory markers of renal and bone safety as compared to TDF in clinical trials in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Data show that because TAF enters cells, including HIV-infected cells, more efficiently than TDF, it can be given at a much lower dose and there is 90 percent less tenofovir in the bloodstream. As people are living longer with HIV, there is an increasing need to develop new treatments that are tolerable and help address long-term health for patients, said John C. Martin, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. Odefseys safety, efficacy and tolerability profile offers a new treatment option to support the needs of a range of patients and represents Gileads commitment to innovation in the field of HIV. The approval is supported by a bioequivalence study demonstrating that Odefsey achieved similar drug levels of emtricitabine and TAF in the blood as Genvoya (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg or E/C/F/TAF) and similar drug levels of rilpivirine as Edurant (rilpivirine 25 mg). The safety, efficacy and tolerability of Odefsey is supported by clinical studies of rilpivirine-based therapy (administered as R+F/TDF or R/F/TDF) and F/TAF-based therapy (administered as E/C/F/TAF) in a range of patients with HIV, including treatment-nave adults and adolescents, virologically suppressed adults who switched from PI-, NNRTI- and INSTI-based regimens and virologically suppressed adults with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. The Odefsey approval is part of an ongoing development and commercialization agreement between Gilead and Janssen, first established in 2009. Under this agreement, Gilead is responsible for the manufacturing, registration, distribution and commercialization of the product in most countries, while Janssen will distribute it in approximately 17 markets and have co-detailing rights in several key markets, including the United States. The original agreement was established for the development and commercialization of Complera, marketed as Eviplera in the European Union, and expanded in 2014 to include Odefsey. Odefsey does not cure HIV infection or AIDS. Patient Assistance Programs Gileads U.S. Advancing Access program provides assistance to appropriate patients in the United States who are uninsured, underinsured or who need financial assistance to pay for their medications, including Odefsey. The program offers information and assistance for patients, including: Access to agents who can provide information related to coverage and insurance-related questions.

FDA approves new antiretroviral medication for patients with multidrug-resistant HIV,,,,,"FDA approves new antiretroviral medication for patients with multidrug-resistant HIV FDA Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trogarzo (ibalizumab-uiyk), a new type of antiretroviral medication for adult patients living with HIV who have tried multiple HIV medications in the past (heavily treatment-experienced) and whose HIV infections cannot be successfully treated with other currently available therapies (multidrug resistant HIV, or MDR HIV).Trogarzo is administered intravenously once every 14 days by a trained medical professional and used in combination with other antiretroviral medications. ""While most patients living with HIV can be successfully treated using a combination of two or more antiretroviral drugs, a small percentage of patients who have taken many HIV drugs in the past have multidrug resistant HIV, limiting their treatment options and putting them at a high risk of HIV-related complications and progression to death,"" said Jeff Murray, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Antiviral Products in the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Trogarzo is the first drug in a new class of antiretroviral medications that can provide significant benefit to patients who have run out of HIV treatment options. New treatment options may be able to improve their outcomes."" The safety and efficacy of Trogarzo were evaluated in a clinical trial of 40 heavily treatment-experienced patients with MDR HIV-1 who continued to have high levels of virus (HIV-RNA) in their blood despite being on antiretroviral drugs. Many of the participants had previously been treated with 10 or more antiretroviral drugs. The majority of participants experienced a significant decrease in their HIV-RNA levels one week after Trogarzo was added to their failing antiretroviral regimens. After 24 weeks of Trogarzo plus other antiretroviral drugs, 43 percent of the trials participants achieved HIV RNA suppression. The clinical trial focused on the small patient population with limited treatment options and demonstrated the benefit of Trogarzo in achieving reduction of HIV RNA. The seriousness of the disease, the need to individualize other drugs in the treatment regimen, and safety data from other trials were considered in evaluating the Trogarzo development program. A total of 292 patients with HIV-1 infection have been exposed to Trogarzo IV infusion. The most common adverse reactions to Trogarzo were diarrhea, dizziness, nausea and rash. Severe side effects included rash and changes in the immune system (immune reconstitution syndrome). The FDA granted this application Fast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations. Trogarzo also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases. The FDA granted approval of Trogarzo to TaiMed Biologics USA Corp.

Common birth control drug ups risk of HIV,,,,,"Common birth control drug ups risk of HIV Independent Online/AFPAsian News International Women beware! A study has recently warned that a popular injectable contraceptive drug can increase the risk of HIV infection in women by 40 percent. Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is an injectable birth control shot administered every three months, which prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens the mucous layer around the cervix to block sperm from getting through. According to researchers, transitioning away from DMPA could help protect women from becoming infected with HIV. Human studies suggest DMPA use may raise the risk of HIV infection by 40 percent. The findings suggest other forms of birth control should rapidly replace DMPA shots, the researchers noted. The team wanted to review the underlying biological mechanisms that could contribute to increased risk of HIV infection for certain hormonal contraceptives but not others. ""To protect individual and public health, it is important to ensure women in areas with high rates of HIV infection have access to affordable contraceptive options,"" said first study author Janet P. Hapgood from the University of Cape Town in South Africa. ""Increasing availability of contraceptives that use a different form of the female hormone progestin than the one found in DMPA could help reduce the risk of HIV transmission,"" Hapgood added. The team examined animal, cell and biochemical research on the form of progestin used in DMPA - medroxprogesterone acetate, or MPA. MPA is used in birth control and as part of menopausal hormone therapy. The analysis revealed MPA acts differently than other forms of progestin used in contraceptives. MPA behaves like the stress hormone cortisol in the cells of the genital tract that can come in contact with HIV. The researchers explained that the increased rate of HIV infection among women using DMPA contraceptive shots is likely due to multiple reasons, including decreases in immune function and the protective barrier function of the female genital tract. ""Studying the biology of MPA helps us understand what may be driving the increased rate of HIV infection seen in human research. The research appears in journal of Endocrine Reviews.

India to ban discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS,,,,,"India to ban discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS Independent Online/CNN India has passed a landmark bill which aims to ensure equal rights for those living with HIV/AIDS. The HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, passed by the countrys parliament on Tuesday, will make it illegal to discriminate against people living with and affected by HIV.It is the first of its kind in south Asia, and will make India the largest country in the world to ban this kind of discrimination. The legislation will make it illegal to discriminate against those living with HIV in the workplace; deny them access to education, housing and health care, or the right to stand for or hold public or private office. The legislation also bans businesses and other public places from refusing entry to anyone with HIV/AIDS. There are also provisions where a person with HIV is not required to undergo an HIV test, medical treatment or research without their consent. An individual will also have the right to not disclose their status unless they choose to or if required by a court order.There were more than 2.1 million people living with HIV in India in 2015, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations program which monitors global action on HIV/AIDS. Positive move Speaking Tuesday, Indias Health Minister J. P. Nadda said the bill was ""historic"" and promised action ""against those who create hatred against HIV patients,"" according to the Press Trust of India. The move was welcomed by many organizations that advocate for people living with HIV. ""This legislation begins to remove barriers and empowers people to challenge violations of their human rights,"" said Steve Kraus, director of the UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific. Huidrom Rosenara, an associate director with the Delhi-based India HIV/AIDS Alliance, told CNN that ""there have been many incidents of discrimination in hospitals, schools and communities."" ""These incidents have decreased compared to decades ago but they still occur,"" she said. ""(The legislation) is a long awaited and positive move. We are very optimistic about it as it speaks volumes about the political commitment."" Long time coming India has the highest number of people living with HIV in the Asia Pacific region, and the third highest in the world, behind South Africa and Nigeria, both of which have also passed laws banning some forms of discrimination. There were an estimated 36.7 million people living with HIV/AIDS globally in 2015, according to UNAIDS. In India, more than 68,000 people died of AIDS that same year.It took more than 15 years to table Tuesdays act, discussion of which first began in 2002. The bill has received assent from both of Indias houses of parliament and is awaiting presidential approval before it becomes law. Rosenara from the India HIV/AIDS Alliance warned the law ""wont change the publics mindset,"" but agreed it was a step in the right direction.

In the trial backed by Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline, people living with the virus were given a shot containing two drugs every four or eight weeks. At both intervals, the shot worked just as well as people who were taking three pills per day to suppress their virus, Reuters reports. Paul Stoffels, head of pharmaceuticals at Johnson & Johnson, told Reuters that the findings were ""transformational"" in the fight against HIV. Stoffels said he believed the long-acting injection could help improve the lives of those living with HIV by 2020. The numbers: The study found that 94% of participants who received the monthly injection were viral suppressed 32 weeks into the trial, and 95% or those who got the shot every two months. By comparison, 91% of people on pill-based regimens achieved an undetectable viral load, according to Reuters. The human immunodeficiency virus takes over a bodys white blood cells and turns them into factories that make more HIV. Those white blood cells, which fight off disease, are no longer able to do so. The number of viral copies in a persons body is called someones viral load. When HIV treatment is successful, a person is considered to be HIV undetectable, meaning the amount of virus in their blood is not able to be detected by many tests. Being HIV undetectable significantly reduces the chance of transmitting the virus. Public health benefits: A 2014 PARTNER study found that, out of hundreds of thousands of sex acts between thousands of mixed-status couples, not one person contracted HIV from their partner. In each couple, the HIV-positive partner was undetectable and couples involved did not use condoms 100% of the time. Currently, about 50,000 people each year are diagnosed with HIV. Of those 50,000 infections, 91% are the result of an HIV-positive person not knowing their status or not being in care. One of the trial drugs, rilpivirine (Edurant), is already widely used to treat HIV. The second, cabotegravir, is still being studied by the FDA. Having an alternative method of helping people stay HIV undetectable is important for public health and the personal health of those living with the virus. Currently, only 30% of the 1.2 million people living with HIV in the U.S. are undetectable. What makes a person non-adherent to their medications differs from person to person. Everything from having to take too many pills to not having enough food to eat is associated with HIV treatment failure. One 2012 study also showed that poverty, as well as the stress associated with poverty, is a huge deterrent to staying undetectable and healthy.

HIV/AIDS: The basics,,,,,"HIV/AIDS: The basics AIDSinfo Key Points • HIV is the virus that causes HIV infection. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. • HIV is spread through contact with the blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, or breast milk of a person with HIV. In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by having anal or vaginal sex or sharing injection drug equipment, such as needles, with a person who has HIV. • Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. • ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART can’t cure HIV infection, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines can also reduce the risk of HIV transmission. What is HIV/AIDS? HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes HIV infection. The abbreviation “HIV” can refer to the virus or to HIV infection. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells of the immune system. The loss of CD4 cells makes it difficult for the body to fight infections and certain cancers. Without treatment, HIV can gradually destroy the immune system and advance to AIDS. How is HIV spread? HIV is spread through contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV. These body fluids include: Blood Semen Pre-seminal fluid Vaginal fluids Rectal fluids Breast milk The spread of HIV from person to person is called HIV transmission. The spread of HIV from a woman with HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding is called mother-to-child transmission of HIV. To reduce your risk of HIV infection, use condoms correctly every time you have sex, limit your number of sexual partners, and n Key Points • HIV gradually destroys the immune system by attacking and killing a type of white blood cell called a CD4 cell. CD4 cells play a major role in protecting the body from infection. • HIV uses the machinery of the CD4 cells to multiply (make copies of itself) and spread throughout the body. This process, which is carried out in seven steps or stages, is called the HIV life cycle. HIV medicines protect the immune system by blocking HIV at different stages of the HIV life cycle. • Antiretroviral therapy or ART is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes every day. Because each class of drugs is designed to target a specific step in the HIV life cycle, ART is very effective at preventing HIV from multiplying. ART also reduces the risk of HIV drug resistance. • ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission (the spread of HIV to others). ever share injection drug equipment. Also talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who don’t have HIV but who are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day. Mother-to-child transmission is the most common way that children get HIV. HIV medicines, given to women with HIV during pregnancy and childbirth and to their babies after birth, reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. You can’t get HIV by shaking hands or hugging a person who has HIV. You also can’t get HIV from contact with objects such as dishes, toilet seats, or doorknobs used by a person with HIV. HIV is not spread through the air or in water or by mosquitoes, ticks, or other blood-sucking insects. What is the treatment for HIV? Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. (HIV medicines are often called antiretrovirals or ARVs.) ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART prevents HIV from multiplying and reduces the amount of HIV in the body (also called the viral load). Having less HIV in the body protects the immune system and prevents HIV infection from advancing to AIDS. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. A main goal of ART is to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level. An undetectable viral load means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a viral load test. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex. What are the symptoms of HIV/AIDS? Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, some people may have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, or rash. The symptoms may last for a few days to several weeks. After this earliest stage of HIV infection, HIV continues to multiply but at very low levels. More severe symptoms of HIV infection, such as signs of opportunistic infections, generally don’t appear for many years. (Opportunistic infections are infections and infection-related cancers that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in people with healthy immune systems.) Without treatment with HIV medicines, HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though it may advance faster in some people. HIV transmission is possible at any stage of HIV infection—even if a person with HIV has no symptoms of HIV. How is AIDS diagnosed? Symptoms such as fever, weakness, and weight loss may be a sign that a person’s HIV has advanced to AIDS. However, a diagnosis of AIDS is based on the following criteria: A drop in CD4 count to less than 200 cells/mm3. A CD4 count measures the number of CD4 cells in a sample of blood. OR The presence of certain opportunistic infections. Although an AIDS diagnosis indicates severe damage to the immune system, HIV medicines can still help people at this stage of HIV infection. The HIV Life Cycle What is the HIV life cycle? HIV attacks and destroys the CD4 cells of the immune system. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that play a major role in protecting the body from infection. HIV uses the machinery of the CD4 cells to multiply (make copies of itself) and spread throughout the body. This process, which is carried out in seven steps or stages, is called the HIV life cycle. What is the connection between the HIV life cycle and HIV medicines? Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. HIV medicines protect the immune system by blocking HIV at different stages of the HIV life cycle. HIV medicines are grouped into different drug classes according to how they fight HIV. Each class of drugs is designed to target a specific step in the HIV life cycle. Because an HIV regimen includes HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes, ART is very effective at preventing HIV from multiplying. Having less HIV in the body protects the immune system and prevents HIV from advancing to AIDS. ART also reduces the risk of HIV drug resistance. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission (the spread of HIV to others). What are the seven stages of the HIV life cycle? The seven stages of the HIV life cycle are: 1) binding, 2) fusion, 3) reverse transcription, 4) integration, 5) replication, 6) assembly, and 7) budding. To understand each stage in the HIV life cycle, it helps to first imagine what HIV looks like. The Basics of HIV Prevention How is HIV spread? The person-to-person spread of HIV is called HIV transmission. HIV is transmitted (spread) only in certain body fluids from a person who has HIV: Blood Semen Key Points • HIV is spread only in certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. These fluids are blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. • In the United States, HIV is spread mainly by having sex or sharing injection drug equipment, such as needles, with someone who has HIV. • To reduce your risk of HIV infection, use condoms correctly every time you have sex. Don’t inject drugs. If you do, use only sterile injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others. • If you don’t have HIV but are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV, talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Pre-seminal fluids Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk HIV transmission is only possible if these fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or are directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe). Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, the vagina, the opening of the penis, and the mouth. HIV can also spread from a woman with HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth (also called labor and delivery), or breastfeeding. This spread of HIV is called mother-to-child transmission of HIV. In the past, some people were infected with HIV after receiving a blood transfusion or organ or tissue transplant from a donor with HIV. Today, this risk is very low because donated blood, organs, and tissues are carefully tested in the United States. You can’t get HIV from casual contact with a person who has HIV, for example from a handshake, a hug, or a closed-mouth kiss. And you can’t get HIV from contact with objects such as toilet seats, doorknobs, or dishes used by a person who has HIV. How can I reduce my risk of getting HIV? Anyone can get HIV, but you can take steps to protect yourself from HIV infection. Get tested and know your partner’s HIV status. Talk to your partner about HIV testing and get tested before you have sex. Use this testing locator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to find an HIV testing location near you. Have less risky sex. HIV is mainly spread by having anal or vaginal sex without a condom or without taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Use condoms. Use a condom correctly every time you have sex. Read this fact sheet from CDC on how to use condoms correctly. Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with HIV whose HIV is not well controlled or to have a partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Both of these factors can increase the risk of HIV transmission. Get tested and treated for STDs. Insist that your partners get tested and treated too. Having an STD can increase your risk of becoming infected with HIV or spreading it to others. Talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who don’t have HIV but who are at high risk of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day. Don’t inject drugs. But if you do, use only sterile drug injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others. I am HIV positive but my partner is HIV negative. How can I protect my partner from HIV? Take HIV medicines daily. Treatment with HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART can’t cure HIV infection, but it can reduce the amount of HIV in the body (also called the viral load). A main goal of ART is to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level. An undetectable viral load means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a viral load test. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex. Here are some other steps you can take to protect your partner from HIV: Use condoms correctly every time you have sex. Talk to your partner about taking PrEP. If you inject drugs, don’t share your needles, syringes, or other drug equipment with your partner. Are HIV medicines used in other situations to prevent HIV infection? Yes, HIV medicines are also used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) PEP is the use of HIV medicines to reduce the risk of HIV infection soon after a possible exposure to HIV. PEP may be used, for example, after a person has sex without a condom with a person who has HIV or after a health care worker is accidentally exposed to HIV in the workplace. To be effective, PEP must be started within 3 days after the possible exposure to HIV. PEP involves taking HIV medicines each day for 28 days. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV Women with HIV take HIV medicines during pregnancy and childbirth to reduce the risk of passing HIV to their babies and to protect their own health. Their newborn babies also receive HIV medicine for 4 to 6 weeks after birth. The HIV medicine reduces the risk of infection from any HIV that may have entered a baby’s body during childbirth. HIV Treatment: The Basics Key Points • Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. • ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. People with HIV should start ART as soon as possible. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. • Before starting ART, people with HIV talk to their health care provider about possible side effects of HIV medicines and potential drug interactions between HIV medicines or between HIV medicines and other medicines a person is taking. • Overall, the benefits of HIV medicines far outweigh the risk of side effects. In addition, newer HIV regimens cause fewer side effects than regimens used in the past. What is antiretroviral therapy? Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the use of HIV medicines to treat HIV infection. People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day. ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. ART can’t cure HIV, but HIV medicines help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. ART also reduces the risk of HIV transmission. How do HIV medicines work? HIV attacks and destroys the infection-fighting CD4 cells of the immune system. Loss of CD4 cells makes it hard for the body to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. HIV medicines prevent HIV from multiplying (making copies of itself), which reduces the amount of HIV in the body (also called the viral load). Having less HIV in the body gives the immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in the body, the immune system is strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. By reducing the amount of HIV in the body, HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission. A main goal of ART is to reduce a person’s viral load to an undetectable level. An undetectable viral load means that the level of HIV in the blood is too low to be detected by a viral load test. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner through sex. When is it time to start taking HIV medicines? People with HIV should start ART as soon as possible. In people with the following conditions, it’s especially important to start ART right away: pregnancy, AIDS, certain HIV-related illnesses and coinfections, and early HIV infection. (Early HIV infection is the period up to 6 months after infection with HIV.) What HIV medicines are included in an HIV regimen? There are many HIV medicines available for HIV regimens. The HIV medicines are grouped into seven drug classes according to how they fight HIV. A person’s initial HIV regimen usually includes three HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes. Selection of an HIV regimen depends on several factors, including possible side effects of HIV medicines and potential drug interactions between medicines. Because the needs of people with HIV vary, there are several HIV regimens to choose from. What should people know about taking HIV medicines? Here are some things health care providers discuss with their patients before prescribing HIV medicines. Side effects Sometimes HIV medicines can cause side effects. Most side effects from HIV medicines are manageable, but a few can be serious. Overall, the benefits of HIV medicines far outweigh the risk of side effects. In addition, newer HIV regimens cause fewer side effects than regimens used in the past. As HIV treatment options continue to improve, people are less likely to experience side effects from their HIV medicines. Side effects from HIV medicines can vary depending on the medicine and the person taking the medicine. People taking the same HIV medicine can have very different side effects. Some side effects, like headaches or occasional dizziness, may not be serious. Other side effects, such as swelling of the throat and tongue or liver damage, can be life-threatening. Drug interactions HIV medicines can interact with other HIV medicines in an HIV regimen. They can also interact with other medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products. A drug interaction can reduce or increase a medicines effect on the body. Drug interactions can also cause unwanted side effects. Drug resistance When HIV multiplies in the body, the virus sometimes mutates (changes form) and makes variations of itself. Variations of HIV that develop while a person is taking HIV medicines can lead to drug-resistant strains of HIV. HIV medicines that previously controlled a person’s HIV are not effective against the new, drug-resistant HIV. In other words, the person’s HIV continues to multiply. Poor adherence to an HIV regimen—not taking HIV medicines every day and exactly as prescribed—increases the risk of drug resistance and treatment failure.",{},"['called', 'hivaids', 'risk', 'art', 'hiv', 'spread', 'body', 'medicines', 'person', 'basics', 'drug', 'infection']","HIV/AIDS: The basicsAIDSinfoKey Points• HIV is the virus that causes HIV infection.

Gurova manages a project in her insurgent-controlled home city of Lugansk handing out clean syringes and condoms to drug-users and sex workers who are most at risk from HIV and hepatitis. That puts her at the forefront of the perilous struggle against the spread of infections as more than three years of conflict and rebel rule have hit vital treatment programmes. ""Everything has worsened,"" Gurova, from the All-Ukrainian Public Health Association, a charitable organisation, told AFP. Getting supplies such as condoms, lubricants and hygienic wipes into rebel-held territory remains a constant challenge as they run the gauntlet of checkpoints to cross the tightly guarded frontline. While Gurova still manages to keep these programmes going, substitute treatments for drug addicts including methadone have stopped entirely. This has seen users who were being weaned away from injecting themselves turn to dangerous local alternatives -- and bolstered the threat of the spread of diseases. ""There are more cases of HIV infections among users and it is very difficult to make contact with them,"" Gurova said. Alongside this problem, activists say there has been a rise in the number of sex workers in the grey zone along the frontline. Prior to the start of the conflict in April 2014, ex-Soviet Ukraine -- especially in its eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk -- was already battling one of the most severe HIV epidemics in Eastern Europe. But thanks to progressive policies the country was making progress and had managed to reduce the rate of HIV infections, most dramatically among young drug users. After the war flared up in 2014, experts soon warned that the conflict risked jeopardising any gains that had been made. As Kiev lost control over Donetsk and Lugansk, health services and key treatments for infections were hit. In 2015, international actors managed to stave off an imminent crisis by negotiating with Kiev and the rebels to keep supplying antiretroviral drugs to thousands of HIV positive people in the separatist territories. Emergency funds were provided and the United Nations now estimates that about 10,000 adults and children with HIV in rebel-held areas are receiving the drugs. But while negotiations have been successful in getting the most urgent treatments through for now, in terms of prevention the situation still looks dire. Doctor Igor Pirogov, who works at a hospital treating drug users in rebel capital Donetsk, said that the war has seriously disrupted attempts to curb addiction. ""Most of our patients put on a uniform, got a weapon and went off to fight"" for the insurgents, Pirogov said. ""Many even said openly that they were using more drugs during the war than when it was peaceful."" The internationally approved opioid replacement treatments that had become the norm in Ukraine have ended. Due to security restrictions the Ukrainian authorities say they are unable to deliver substitute drugs across the frontline. For their part the rebels seem to have followed in the footsteps of their backers in Russia -- where methadone is banned -- and turned the clock back on progressive treatments. Activist Gurova said that about 900 patients had lost access to the methadone programme, leading many to turn instead to dangerous local alternatives.",{},"['spread', 'hiv', 'users', 'infections', 'rebelheld', 'rebels', 'struggle', 'ukraine', 'activists', 'gurova', 'war', 'lugansk', 'stem', 'treatments', 'methadone']","As clashes drag on in east Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed rebels, health activist Natalia Gurova is fighting another battle of her own, reports AFP.

How to reach this bold target within the Sustainable Development Goals is the central question facing the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Meeting on Ending AIDS, to be held from 8 to 10 June 2016. The extraordinary accomplishments of the last 15 years have inspired global confidence that this target can be achieved. UNAIDS recommends a Fast-Track approach: substantially increasing and frontloading investment over the next five years to accelerate scale-up and establish the momentum required to overcome within 15 years one of the greatest public health challenges in this generation. The latest UNAIDS data, covering 160 countries, demonstrate both the enormous gains already made and what can be achieved in the coming years through a Fast-Track approach. In just the last two years the number of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy has increased by about a third, reaching 17.0 million people—2 million more than the 15 million by 2015 target set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011. Since the first global treatment target was set in 2003, annual AIDS-related deaths have decreased by 43%. In the world’s most affected region, eastern and southern Africa, the number of people on treatment has more than doubled since 2010, reaching nearly 10.3 million people. AIDS related deaths in the region have decreased by 36% since 2010. However, huge challenges lie ahead. In 2015 there were 2.1 million [1.8 million–2.4 million] new HIV infections worldwide, adding up to a total of 36.7 million [34.0 million–39.8 million] people living with HIV. Scale-up of antiretroviral therapy is on a Fast-Track trajectory that has surpassed expectations. Global coverage of antiretroviral therapy reached 46% [43–50%] at the end of 2015. Gains were greatest in the world’s most affected region, eastern and southern Africa. Coverage increased from 24% [22–25%] in 2010 to 54% [50–58%] in 2015, reaching a regional total of 10.3 million people. South Africa alone had nearly 3.4 million people on treatment, more than any other country in the world. After South Africa, Kenya has the largest treatment programme in Africa, with nearly 900 000 people on treatment at the end of 2015. Botswana, Eritrea, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe all increased treatment coverage by more than 25 percentage points between 2010 and 2015. Treatment coverage in Latin American and the Caribbean reached 55% [47–64%] in 2015. In the Asia and Pacific region, coverage more than doubled, from 19%[17–22%] in 2010 to 41% [35–47%] in 2015. Western and central Africa and the Middle East and North Africa also made important gains but achieved lower levels of coverage in 2015, 28% [23–34%] and 17% [12–24%], respectively. In eastern Europe and central Asia, coverage increased by just a few percentage points in recent years to 21% [20–23%]—about one in five people living with HIV in the region. The gains in treatment are largely responsible for a 26% decline in AIDS-related deaths globally since 2010, from an estimated 1.5 million [1.3 million–1.7 million] in 2010 to 1.1 million [940 000 –1.3 million] in 2015. The reduction in deaths since 2010 has been greater among adult women (33% decrease) compared with adult men (15% decrease), reflecting higher treatment coverage among women than men, 52% [48–57%] and 41% [33–49%], respectively. The gender gap for treatment among adults highlights the impact of gender norms that delay initiation of treatment among men, reduce treatment adherence, blunt the preventive effects of treatment, and lead to men accounting for 58% of adult AIDS related deaths. Declines in new HIV infections among adults have slowed alarmingly in recent years, with the estimated annual number of new infections among adults remaining nearly static at about 1.9 million [1.7 million–2.2 million] in 2015. Beneath this global figure lie multiple disparities—across regions, within countries, between men and women and young and old, and among specific populations being left behind. These disparities must be addressed in order to achieve the reductions required to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. Regional disparities The largest reduction in new adult HIV infections occurred in eastern and southern Africa. There were about 40 000 fewer new adult HIV infections in the region in 2015 than in 2010, a 4% decline. More gradual declines were achieved in the Asia and Pacific region and western and central Africa. Rates of new adult HIV infections were relatively static in Latin America and the Caribbean, western and central Europe, North America and the Middle East and North Africa, while the annual numbers of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and central Asia increased by 57%. Key locations within countries Complex and varied social, structural and economic dynamics within countries account for the uneven geographical distribution of HIV. In many countries, HIV prevalence is higher in cities, where the vibrancy, stress and anonymity of urban life, and its bustle of encounters and interactions, provide increased opportunities for behaviours and sexual networking that may increase the risk of HIV infection. Increased efforts to collect and analyze sub-national data are revealing where HIV infections are occurring and where there are gaps in the provision of HIV services. In Kenya, for example, an analysis in 2014 found that 65% of new HIV infections occurred in just 9 of the country’s 47 counties. This analysis contributed to a national HIV prevention “road map” that defines evidence-informed biomedical and structural interventions and targets them to specific populations and geographical zones. The Kenya AIDS Strategic Framework aims to reduce annual new HIV infections among adults by 75% by 2019. 77% [69–86%] of all pregnant women living with HIV globally received medicines that prevent transmission to their babies in 2015. At least 2.0 million people newly enrolled on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in 2015 – one of the largest annual increases ever. 46% [43–50%] of people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral treatment in 2015.

Prevention programmes reduced the number of new HIV infections per year to 2.1 million in 2015, a 35% decline in incidence since 2000. The massive expansion of antiretroviral therapy has reduced the number of people dying of HIV related causes to approximately 1.1 million 2015 – 45% fewer than in 2005. Having achieved the global target of halting and reversing the spread of HIV, world leaders have set the 2020 “Fast-Track” targets to accelerate the HIV response and to END AIDS BY 2030. A UNAIDS report on World AIDS Day shows that unprecedented acceleration in the AIDS response is producing results for the people. The report also shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last two years the number of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally.",{},"['spread', 'hiv', 'therapy', '2015', 'world', 'number', 'day', 'editor', 'shows', 'treatment', 'aids']","AIDS Day on December 1 brings together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and demonstrate international solidarity in the face of the pandemic.

Alcoholism drug could help cure HIV: Study,"A drug used to treat alcoholism - called disulfiram - could bring us closer to a cure for HIV, according to the results of a new study led by researchers from the University of Melbourne in Australia.

Study leader Prof. Sharon Lewin, of The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at Melbourne, and colleagues publish their findings in The Lancet HIV. Disulfiram (brand name Antabuse) is a drug given to individuals with an alcohol use disorder to discourage them from drinking. It works by blocking an enzyme called dehydrogenase, which plays a role in metabolizing alcohol intake. Inhibiting dehydrogenase causes acute sensitivity to alcohol; if patients consume alcohol while taking disulfiram, they will experience a number of unpleasant side effects, including headache, nausea, chest pain, vomiting, weakness, blurred vision, sweating and mental confusion. But as well as helping to treat alcoholism, Prof. Lewin and colleagues found the drug could lead to a cure for one of the worlds most serious and challenging diseases: HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the primary treatment for HIV, involving a combination of at least three antiretroviral drugs that slow disease progression. While the treatment has led to reductions in HIV death rates worldwide, it is not a cure. ART is unable to eliminate HIV from patients completely; the virus can lay dormant in cells, hiding from immune system attack. But in their phase 2 clinical trial, the researchers found disulfiram helped ""wake up"" dormant HIV cells, allowing them to be destroyed - a ""shock-and-kill"" approach that researchers believe is key to curing the virus. Numerous studies have investigated such an approach. Medical News Today In September, for example, Medical News Today reported on a study that suggested a class of drugs being tested for the treatment of cancer could rewaken dormant HIV cells. However, Prof. Lewin and colleagues note that to date, the drugs trialed to reawaken latent HIV have produced toxic side effects - a major barrier to moving the shock-and-kill approach forward. For their study - conducted in collaboration with researchers from the University of California-San Francisco - the team gave disulfiram to 30 HIV-positive patients in the US and Australia who were receiving ART. Disulfiram was administered daily for 3 days. Patients received 500 mg of the drug on the first day, 1,000 mg on the second day and 2,000 mg on the third day.

�HIV infection still a grave concern�,,,,,"�HIV infection still a grave concern� Staff Reporter Speakers at a press conference in the city yesterday termed media role imperative for creating awareness about prevention of HIV infection. Though incidence of HIV infection has reduced globally, including in Bangladesh, it is still a grave concern with certain groups vulnerable to it, they observed. The speakers noted HIV infection is more prevalent among those who inject illicit drugs, migrant workers, sex workers, sodomites and members of the transgender community. These vulnerable groups need special attention and they should be provided with necessary services, they opined, calling for increasing financial allocation for making the HIV prevention programme a success. The HIV-affected people can also easily contract tuberculosis (TB) for their immunity loss. TB is still a health burden on the people, for which screening is required, they remarked. Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) organised the media briefing at its Dhanmondi office with support from Save the Children. Director General of Press Institute of Bangladesh (PIB) Mohammad Shah Alamgir Hossain as the chief guest attended the programme with DAM President Kazi Rafiqul Alam in the chair. Deputy Director of Save the Children Sheikh Masudul Alam presented the key-note paper at the briefing. Deputy Director of DAM Iqbal Masud and others also spoke on the occasion. The media briefing was arranged ahead of the World AIDS Day to be observed on December 1. Citing a UNAIDS report, Sheikh Masudul Alam said globally, 36.9 million people are living with HIV and new HIV infections among adults and children were estimated at 2 million in 2014, a 35 per cent decline since the year 2000. In Bangladesh in 2014, it was estimated that 8,900 people were living with HIV and 433 new cases were detected that year. Of the total, 563 victims died. A total of 309 children (aged 0-14 years) were found living with HIV and the estimated number of new infections among them was 63. The children are infected mainly for mother to child transmission, Masudul Alam said. Nothing could be known about the HIV prevalence among Bangladesh’s young people. It was estimated that 799 young people were living with HIV in 2014. The reported number of new cases of HIV in 2014 was 58. In Bangladesh, women accounted for 30 percent of the newly reported cases, added Alam. Shah Alamgir Hossain called for expanding coverage and quality and comprehensiveness of interventions for vulnerable people at the highest risk of HIV. He also called for building the capacity of the government and NGOs at the national and district levels to scale up standardised and high quality interventions to monitor and improve coverage and quality and to improve coordination.",{},"['living', 'vulnerable', 'hiv', 'grave', 'alam', 'media', 'quality', 'estimated', 'bangladesh', 'children', 'concern', 'infection']","�HIV infection still a grave concern�Staff ReporterSpeakers at a press conference in the city yesterday termed media role imperative for creating awareness about prevention of HIV infection.

Cure for HIV reportedly 3 years away,,,,,"Cure for HIV reportedly 3 years away A cure for HIV and AIDS reportedly could be just a few years away after scientists have been able to successfully snip away the virus from infected cells and prevent the disease from returning. Scientists at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University are confident that within the next three years they will be able to start human trials, the UK Daily Telegraph reported. American researchers have previously shown that it’s possible to edit genes to cut the virus from DNA cells entirely. British experts believe that this treatment, which has only been tested in labs, would allow the body to effectively “cure itself from the inside,” the newspaper reported. Human immune cells that were tested in the labs have showed no alteration to any other part of the genetic code. “The fact that for the first time we have been able to completely eliminate segments of the viral genome in the laboratory demonstrates that we should be able to eliminate it in the human body,” lead researcher Professor Kamel Khalili told The Telegraph. He reiterated that based on the recent findings, clinical trials could start within the next three years. The new technique is called Crispr/Cas9. It involves targeting the genetic code of HIV which inserts into cells, according to The Telegraph. Scientists then take the Cas9 protein and edit it so it can recognize viral code. The patient’s blood is then taken and scientists would inject Cas9, which would then seek out the HIV virus in the cells. The protein then releases and enzyme and snips out the virus. Scientists are confident that replacing 20 percent of immune cells with genetically altered cells would be enough to cure the virus. “It is an important step forward. This is part of a wave of research that is being done using these new techniques to attack HIV in particular but also a number of other diseases,” Britain’s Manchester University Professor Matthew Cobb told Radio 4, according to the newspaper. According to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1.2 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV and about 12.8 percent of them are unaware that they have the virus. Those infected take an antiretroviral drug to control the infection, but need to take it for the rest of their life. If they stop taking the treatment, the virus could cause AIDS.

New antibody drug continues to show promise for treatment of HIV,,,,,"New antibody drug continues to show promise for treatment of HIV Great strides have been made in recent years to develop treatment options for HIV, and the disease can now be controlled with anti-retroviral drugs. But a cure remains elusive and current medications have limitations: they must be taken daily, for life, and can cause long-term complications. Now, Rockefeller scientists report that they are one step closer to an alternative treatment that utilizes antibodies. This therapy has the potential for long-acting effects and would allow for less frequent dosing. Recently published in Nature, the findings suggest that an antibody called 3BNC117 can effectively delay the virus from rebounding inpatients who temporarily suspended their anti-retroviral medications, currently the standard treatment for HIV. ""These are very positive results,"" says Marina Caskey, Assistant Professor of Clinical Investigation in the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, headed by Michel Nussenzweig. ""This is the longest any antibody has been able to delay virus rebound."" Keeping HIV at bay The 3BNC117 antibody was isolated in the Nussenzweig lab several years ago by guest investigator Johannes Scheid, co-first author of this most recent publication. It was cloned from cells of an HIV-infected patient whose immune system was able to fight HIV particularly well. The virus primarily infects CD4 T cells, part of the immune system that helps protect the body from infection. 3BNC117 stops multiple strains of HIV from hijacking these cells. Anti-retroviral drugs suppress HIV by preventing its replication, but the virus remains dormant in the body, mostly in reservoirs within CD4 cells. If a patient stops taking anti-retroviral drugs, the virus is released from these reservoirs, and quickly rebounds. This small study, called a Phase IIa clinical trial, builds on a previous study from the Nussenzweig lab, in which HIV-infected patients were given the antibody without receiving other treatment. This time, the researchers tested 13 HIV-infected patients who had been treated successfully with antiviral therapy. The goal of the study was to determine whether the antibody alone would be able to maintain virus suppression in patients that were taken off anti-retroviral drugs. Caskey and colleagues found that the antibody was able to delay when the virus came back to about 10 weeks, compared to about 3 weeks in controls. Virus under pressure One of the many challenges in treating HIV is that the virus quickly mutates. As a result, patients carry many different strains that cannot be eliminated with a single medication, and each persons virus repertoire is different. An advantage of 3BNC117 is that is has the ability to fight a wide range of HIV strains, but not all; some studies suggest it can neutralize about 80 percent of viral isolates taken from patients. In this study, the researchers tried to select participants whose viral strains were likely to be a good target for 3BNC117. However, current testing methods are not very precise in predicting exactly which strains are present, and patients had varied responses. ""In one-third of participants, rebound happened very late, when the antibody levels were low,"" says co-first author and former graduate student in the Nussenzweig lab, Josh Horwitz. ""This means that the antibody was effective at suppressing the viruses that are sensitive to it, but its also clear that for the remaining patients with different strains of HIV, this antibody is not sufficient."" The researchers also found that the antibody was able to reduce the assortment of viral strains that rebounded, which tends to be very diverse in patients taken off antiretroviral medications. ""We were excited to see a significant delay in rebound,"" says Sheid, ""but the reduced diversity of viruses that we saw is also promising because it will take fewer additional antibodies to target them."" The next step will be to test 3BNC117 in combination with another HIV-specific antibody, such as 10-1074, which targets the virus from a different angle, and has also been shown to decrease virus levels when given to HIV patients not on treatment. ""There are a lot of factors at play here, part of which is that we are working with a diverse reservoir of viruses with different sensitivities to different antibodies,"" says Caskey. ""However, we are hopeful that testing the antibodies in combination will be successful in bringing us closer to better strategies to prevent and treat HIV.""

China sees 14pc surge in new HIV cases,,,,,"China sees 14pc surge in new HIV cases BBC China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens who are living with HIV and Aids, reports BBC. More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say. About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone. The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past. Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions. But the number of people contracting HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province. Year-on-year, however, the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has risen by 100,000 people. HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in Chinas LGBT community. Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be rife. Because of the countrys conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women. Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.

The average time between HIV infection and diagnosis was three years in 2015, seven months earlier than it had been in 2011, according to researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A seven-month improvement in four years is a considerable decrease and shows that the United States is on the right track, the CDC said. ""Overall, it reveals that we as a nation are making great progress in HIV prevention,"" Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, the CDC director, said during a news briefing on the newly released data. ""These findings are more encouraging signs that the tide continues to turn on our nations HIV epidemic,"" she said earlier in a prepared statement. ""HIV is being diagnosed more quickly, the number of people who have the virus under control is up and annual infections are down. So while we celebrate our progress, we pledge to work together to end this epidemic forever."" The CDC report was based on HIV surveillance data from all 50 states and more than 20 large cities. Overall, 85 percent of the estimated 1.1 million people living with HIV in the United States in 2014 knew they were infected. The CDC estimates that people unaware of their HIV status are responsible for about 40 percent of new infections. In particular, it appears that efforts to get high-risk people tested for HIV are paying off. Groups that more frequently reported getting a recent HIV test included: Gay men (from 63 percent tested in 2008 to 71 percent in 2014). People who inject drugs (from 50 percent in 2009 to 58 percent in 2015). Heterosexuals at increased risk for infection (from 34 percent in 2010 to 41 percent in 2016). However, that still leaves large numbers of at-risk people who are not getting tested, CDC officials noted. The CDC recommends that all teenagers and adults be tested for HIV at least once during their lifetime, and people in high-risk groups should be tested at least annually. But, Fitzgerald said, ""we also know we are still missing opportunities for testing people most at risk for HIV."" The study revealed that seven in 10 people at high risk for HIV infection saw a health care provider in the past year but did not get tested, signaling a missed opportunity. Testing is key to preventing the spread of HIV, the CDC researchers explained. One-quarter of people diagnosed with HIV in 2015 carried the virus for seven or more years without knowing it. ""If you are at risk for HIV, dont guess -- get a test,"" Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDCs National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, said in the CDC statement. ""The benefits are clear. Prompt diagnosis is prevention. It is the first step to protecting people living with HIV and their partners."" Once diagnosed, people can be treated with drugs that suppress HIV down to nearly undetectable levels in their blood, he added during the news briefing. ""In recent studies of thousands of couples where one partner has HIV and the other does not, there have been no sexually transmitted HIV infections when the HIV-positive partner was virally suppressed,"" Mermin said. Lack of prompt testing varies based on a persons race or ethnicity and the risk group to which they belong, according to the CDC. For instance: Gay and bisexual males received their HIV diagnosis three years after infection, on average, compared with five years for heterosexual men and 2½ years for women. White people tended to be diagnosed an average of two years after infection, compared with three years for blacks and Hispanics, and four years for Asian-Americans. Fitzgerald added, ""Once diagnosed, HIV can be treated so people who have HIV can live long, healthy lives.""",{},"['quickly', 'risk', 'diagnoses', 'hiv', 'tested', 'prevention', 'seven', 'occurring', 'virus', 'states', 'cdc', 'diagnosed', 'infection']","""Overall, it reveals that we as a nation are making great progress in HIV prevention,"" Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, the CDC director, said during a news briefing on the newly released data.

The SEA Region of WHO is home to 26% of the world’s population; however, the Region accounts for 45.6% of the global burden in terms of TB incidence. In 2015, there were an estimated 4.7 million incidence cases of TB, and about 710 000 people died due to TB in the SEA Region. In addition, an estimated 227 000 cases (4.7%) of the 4.7 million incident cases in the Region were HIV positive. This corresponds to an incidence of HIV co-infected TB cases of about 12 per 100 000 population. An estimated 406 000 children in the Region developed TB in 2015. Globally, 54% of notified TB patients had a documented HIV test result in 2015. Among HIV-positive TB patients notified globally in 2015, 78% were on ART. People living with HIV are 29 times (26–31) more likely to develop tuberculosis (TB) disease compared with people without HIV and living in the same country. TB is a leading cause of hospitalization and death among adults and children living with HIV, accounting for one in five HIV-related deaths globally. 1.1 WHO response to TB-HIV End TB Strategy: In 2014, the World Health Assembly approved the new strategy to end TB. This Strategy includes (1) bold vision of a world without tuberculosis, and its targets of ending the global tuberculosis epidemic by 2035 with a reduction in tuberculosis deaths by 95% and in tuberculosis incidence by 90%, and elimination of associated catastrophic costs for tuberculosis-affected households; (2) its associated milestones for 2020, 2025 and 2030; (3) its principles addressing: government stewardship and accountability; coalition-building with affected communities and civil society; equity, human rights and ethics; and adaptation to fit the needs of each epidemiological, socioeconomic and health system context. The strategy is based on three pillars: (1) integrated, patient-centred care and prevention; (2) bold policies and supportive systems; and (3) intensified research and innovation. Global Plan to End TB: The Global Plan provides an opportunity for greater alignment among efforts to fight both diseases. Taking inspiration from the UNAIDS target of providing treatment to 90% of people who know their HIV-positive status, the Global Plan calls for countries to find at least 90% of all people with TB in the population that require treatment (including those living with HIV) and place them on appropriate therapy (including TB treatment and preventive therapy for people living with HIV). Reaching these targets will require an accelerated integration of TB and HIV services, as well as strong leadership and political commitment. There also need to be separate but interconnected approaches to address HIV infection in people with TB and to reduce the risk of TB in people living with HIV, in line with the interventions recommended by WHO and UNAIDS for jointly addressing HIV and TB. This Global Plan provides detailed investment scenarios needed to accelerate collaborative efforts to address TB-HIV co-infection in different settings. Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV 2016–2021 maps the way forward along five strategic directions: using accurate strategic information to understand HIV epidemics and focus responses; defining the essential packages of high-impact HIV interventions along the continuum of HIV services; effectively delivering the cascade of HIV services to different populations and locations to achieve equity, maximize impact and ensure quality; implementing sustainable funding models for HIV responses and reducing costs; and innovating new HIV technologies and ways of organizing and delivering services. Ending TB in the South-East Asia Region: Regional Strategic Plan 2016–2020: the guiding principle of the regional strategy is laid on the bedrock of government stewardship; TB prevention, care and control as part of health system strengthening based on primary health care; fostering partnerships at all levels; and promoting ethical values and human rights principles. 1.2 Global response plan Between 2005 and 2014, an estimated 5.8 million lives were saved by TB-HIV interventions. WHO has provided clear recommendations about the interventions needed to prevent, diagnose and treat TB among PLHIV since 2004, collectively known as collaborative TB-HIV activities. They include: establishing mechanisms for collaboration between HIV and TB programmes (joint planning, coordinating bodies, surveillance, and monitoring and evaluation); reducing the HIV burden among TB patients (HIV testing and counselling, provision of ART and CPT to TB patients living with HIV, and HIV prevention, care and support services for TB patients); reducing the burden of TB among PLHIV with the “Three I’s for HIV/TB” (intensified TB case- finding among PLHIV, isoniazid preventive therapy for PLHIV who do not have active TB, and infection control in health care and congregate settings). Variable progress has been made towards these goals in countries of the South-East Asia Region. 1.3 Progress made Integration of HIV and tuberculosis services reduced the annual number of people dying from HIV-associated TB globally from 500 000 [460 000–530 000] in 2000 to 390 000 [350 000–430 000] – a 22% decline in 2014. During this period, 5.9 million lives were saved in Africa. By 2014, 17 of the 41 countries with the highest burden of HIV and TB co- infection are estimated to have met the target of reducing the number of people dying from HIV-associated TB by at least 50%. This is the result mainly of important improvements in the reach, quality and linking of HIV and TB services. Despite these achievements, TB remains a leading cause of HIV-associated hospitalization and death among people living with HIV worldwide. TB accounted for 31% of the estimated 1.4 million HIV-related deaths globally in 2015. Globally, 55% of notified TB patients had a documented HIV test result in 2015. This represented an 18-fold increase in testing coverage since 2004. The figure was highest in the African Region, at 81%, and the Americas at 82%. In 2014, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for notified TB patients who were known to be co- infected with HIV reached 78% globally. Further efforts are needed to reach the target of 100%. This is especially the case given that the number of HIV-positive TB 4. patients on ART in 2014 represented only 33% of the estimated number of people living with HIV who developed TB in 2014. Coverage of co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) among HIV-positive TB patients remains high, and increased slightly to 87% globally and 89% in the African Region in 2014. The number of people living with HIV who were treated with isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) reached 933 000 in 2014, an increase of about 60% compared with 2013. However, provision of IPT was reported by just 23% of countries globally, including only 13 of the 30 high TB-HIV burden countries. As in previous years, a large proportion of the people living with HIV who were initiated on IPT were in South Africa (59%), although in most countries that reported data in 2013 and 2014, coverage levels grew. The rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV has been cut by more than half between 2000 and 2014. Mother-to-child transmission has been eliminated in Thailand.

The UHC framework now lies at the centre of all health programmes. To complement the global World AIDS Day 2017 campaign which promotes the theme Right to health, the World Health Organization will highlight the need for all 36.7 million people living with HIV and those who are vulnerable and affected by the epidemic, to reach the goal of universal health coverage. Key messages to achieve univeral health coverage Leave no one behind. HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis services are integrated. High-quality services are available for those with HIV. People living with HIV have access to affordable care. The HIV response is robust and leads to stronger health systems Under the slogan Everybody counts, WHO will advocate for access to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines, including medicines, diagnostics and other health commodities as well as health care services for all people in need, while also ensuring that they are protected against financial risks. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens peoples defence systems against infections and some types of cancer. As the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually become immunodeficient. Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count. Immunodeficiency results in increased susceptibility to a wide range of infections, cancers and other diseases that people with healthy immune systems can fight off. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from 2 to 15 years to develop depending on the individual. AIDS is defined by the development of certain cancers, infections, or other severe clinical manifestations. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat. As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposis sarcoma, among others. Transmission HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected individuals, such as blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. Risk factors Behaviours and conditions that put individuals at greater risk of contracting HIV include: having unprotected anal or vaginal sex; having another sexually transmitted infection such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and bacterial vaginosis; sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting drugs; receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. Diagnosis Serological tests, such as RDTs or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), detect the presence or absence of antibodies to HIV-1/2 and/or HIV p24 antigen. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis. It is important that these tests are used in combination and in a specific order that has been validated and is based on HIV prevalence of the population being tested. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy, using WHO prequalified tests within a validated approach. It is important to note that serological tests detect antibodies produced by an individual as part of their immune system to fight off foreign pathogens, rather than direct detection of HIV itself. Most individuals develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection and therefore antibodies may not be detectable early, during the so-called window period. This early period of infection represents the time of greatest infectivity; however HIV transmission can occur during all stages of the infection. HIV/AIDS Fact sheet Key facts HIV continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed more than 35 million lives so far. In 2016, 1.0 million people died from HIV-related causes globally. There were approximately 36.7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016 with 1.8 million people becoming newly infected in 2016 globally. 54% of adults and 43% of children living with HIV are currently receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). Global ART coverage for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV is high at 76% . The WHO African Region is the most affected region, with 25.6 million people living with HIV in 2016. The African region also accounts for almost two thirds of the global total of new HIV infections. HIV infection is often diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies. Most often these tests provide same-day test results, which are essential for same day diagnosis and early treatment and care. Key populations are groups who are at increased risk of HIV irrespective of epidemic type or local context. They include: men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, people in prisons and other closed settings, sex workers and their clients, and transgender people. Key populations often have legal and social issues related to their behaviours that increase vulnerability to HIV and reduce access to testing and treatment programmes. In 2015, an estimated 44% of new infections occurred among key populations and their partners. There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with HIV, and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives. It is estimated that currently only 70% of people with HIV know their status. To reach the target of 90%, an additional 7.5 million people need to access HIV testing services. In 2016, 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. Between 2000 and 2016, new HIV infections fell by 39%, and HIV-related deaths fell by one third with 13.1 million lives saved due to ART in the same period. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programmes supported by civil society and a range of development partners. It is best practice to also retest all people initially diagnosed as HIV-positive before they enrol in care and/or treatment to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. Notably, once a person diagnosed with HIV and has started treatment they should not be retested. Testing and diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants has been a challenge. For infants and children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection virological testing must be provided (at 6 weeks of age, or as early as birth) to detect the presence of the virus in infants born to mothers living with HIV. However, new technologies are now becoming available to perform the test at the point of care and enable return of the result on the same day to accelerate appropriate linkage and treatment initiation. HIV testing services HIV testing should be voluntary and the right to decline testing should be recognized. Mandatory or coerced testing by a health care provider, authority, or by a partner or family member is not acceptable as it undermines good public health practice and infringes on human rights. New technologies to help people test themselves are being introduced, with many countries implementing self-testing as an additional option to encourage HIV diagnosis. HIV self-testing is a process whereby a person who wants to know his or her HIV status collects a specimen, performs a test and interprets the test results in private or with someone they trust. HIV self-testing does not provide a definitive HIV-positive diagnosis instead, it is an initial test which requires further testing by a health worker. The sexual partners and drug injecting partners of people diagnosed with HIV infection have an increased probability of also being HIV-positive. WHO recommends assisted HIV partner notification services as a simple and effective way to reach these partners, many of whom are undiagnosed and unaware of their HIV exposure, and may welcome support and an opportunity to test for HIV. All HIV testing services must follow the 5 Cs principles recommended by WHO: informed Consent Confidentiality Counselling Correct test results Connection (linkage to care, treatment and other services). Prevention Individuals can reduce the risk of HIV infection by limiting exposure to risk factors. Key approaches for HIV prevention, which are often used in combination, are listed below. Male and female condom use Correct and consistent use of male and female condoms during vaginal or anal penetration can protect against the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Evidence shows that male latex condoms have an 85% or greater protective effect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Testing and counselling for HIV and STIs Testing for HIV and other STIs is strongly advised for all people exposed to any of the risk factors. This way people learn of their own infection status and access necessary prevention and treatment services without delay. WHO also recommends offering testing for partners or couples. Additionally, WHO is recommending assisted partner notification approaches so that people with HIV receive support to inform their partners either on their own, or with the help of health care providers. Testing and counselling, linkages to tuberculosis care Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common presenting illness and cause of death among people with HIV. It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, responsible for 1 of 3 HIV-associated deaths. Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services and routine HIV testing should be offered to all patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB. Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV and active TB should urgently start effective TB treatment (including for multidrug resistant TB) and ART. TB preventive therapy should be offered to all people with HIV who do not have active TB. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) Medical male circumcision, reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This is a key prevention intervention supported in 15 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. VMMC is also regarded as a good approach to reach men and adolescent boys who do not often seek health care services. Since the 2007 WHO recommendation for VMMC as an additional prevention strategy, nearly 15 million adolescent boys and men in ESA were provided a package of services including HIV testing and education on safer sex and condom use. Antiretroviral drug use for prevention Prevention benefits of ART HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a persons body and allows an individuals immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections. A 2011 trial has confirmed that if an HIV-positive person adheres to an effective ART regimen, the risk of transmitting the virus to their uninfected sexual partner can be reduced by 96%. The WHO recommendation to initiate ART in all people living with HIV will contribute significantly to reducing HIV transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-negative partner Oral PrEP of HIV is the daily use of ARV drugs by HIV-negative people to block the acquisition of HIV. More than 10 randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PrEP in reducing HIV transmission among a range of populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples (where one partner is infected and the other is not), men who have sex with men, transgender women, high-risk heterosexual couples, and people who inject drugs. WHO recommends PrEP as a prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of a combination of prevention approaches. WHO has also expanded these recommendations to HIV-negative women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PEP) Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the use of ARV drugs within 72 hours of exposure to HIV in order to prevent infection. PEP includes counselling, first aid care, HIV testing, and administration of a 28-day course of ARV drugs with follow-up care. WHO recommends PEP use for both occupational and non-occupational exposures and for adults and children. Harm reduction for people who inject and use drugs People who inject drugs can take precautions against becoming infected with HIV by using sterile injecting equipment, including needles and syringes, for each injection and not sharing drug using equipment and drug solutions. Treatment of dependence, and in particular opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids, also helps reduce the risk of HIV transmission and supports adherence to HIV treatment. A comprehensive package of interventions for HIV prevention and treatment includes: needle and syringe programmes; opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids and other evidence-based drug dependence treatment; HIV testing and counselling; HIV treatment and care; risk-reduction information and education and provision of naloxone; access to condoms; and management of STIs, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) The transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called vertical or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In the absence of any interventions during these stages, rates of HIV transmission from mother-to-child can be between 15=45%. MTCT can be nearly fully prevented if both the mother and the baby are provided with ARV drugs as early as possible in pregnancy and during the period of breastfeeding. WHO recommends lifelong ART for all people living with HIV, regardless of their CD4 count clinical stage of disease, and this includes women who pregnant or breastfeeding. In 2016, 76% of the estimated 1.4 million pregnant women living with HIV globally received ARV treatments to prevent transmission to their children. A growing number of countries are achieving very low rates of MTCT and some (Armenia, Belarus, Cuba and Thailand) have been formally validated for elimination of MTCT of HIV as a public health problem. Several countries with a high burden of HIV infection are also progressing along the path to elimination. Treatment HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a persons body and allows an individuals immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections. In 2016, WHO released the second edition of the Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection. These guidelines recommend to provide lifelong ART to all people living with HIV, including children, adolescents and adults, pregnant and breastfeeding women, regardless of clinical status or CD4 cell count. By July 2017, 122 countries already have adopted this recommendation by mid-2017, which covers more than 90% of all PLHIV globally. The 2016 guidelines include new alternative ARV options with better tolerability, higher efficacy, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation when compared with medicines being used currently: dolutegravir and low-dose efavirenz for first-line therapy, and raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir for second-line therapy. Transition to these new ARV options has already started in more than 20 countries and is expected to improve the durability of the treatment and the quality of care of people living with HIV. Despite improvements, limited options remain for infants and young children. For this reason, WHO and partners are coordinating efforts to enable a faster and more effective development and introduction of age-appropriate pediatric formulations of antiretrovirals. In addition, 1 in 3 people living with HIV present to care with advanced disease, at low CD4 counts and at high risk of serious illness and death. To reduce this risk, WHO recommends that these patients receive a package of care that includes testing for and prevention of the most common serious infections that can cause death, such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis, in addition to ART. Based on WHOs new recommendations to treat all people living with HIV, the number of people eligible for ART has increased from 28 million to all 36.7 million people living with HIV. In 2016, 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving ART globally, which meant a global coverage of 53% of adults and children. However, more efforts are needed to scale up treatment, particularly for children and adolescents. Only 43% of them were receiving ARVs at the end of 2016 and WHO is supporting countries to accelerate their efforts to timely diagnose and treat these vulnerable populations. Expanding access to treatment is at the heart of a new set of targets for 2020 which aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. WHO response The Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly endorsed a new Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV for 2016-2021. The strategy includes 5 strategic directions that guide priority actions by countries and by WHO over the next six years. The strategic directions are: Information for focused action (know your epidemic and response). Interventions for impact (covering the range of services needed). Delivering for equity (covering the populations in need of services). Financing for sustainability (covering the costs of services). Innovation for acceleration (looking towards the future). WHO is a cosponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS). Within UNAIDS, WHO leads activities on HIV treatment and care, HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, and jointly coordinates with UNICEF the work on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.",{},"['living', 'counts', 'art', 'hiv', 'services', 'testing', 'world', 'everybody', 'day', 'care', 'health', '2017', 'treatment', 'million', 'aids', 'infection']","The most advanced stage of HIV infection is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from 2 to 15 years to develop depending on the individual.

Aside from the lack of verifiable evidence for this non peer-reviewed claim, this research is premature, dangerous and irresponsible. He Jiankui from the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said he edited the DNA of seven embryos being used for fertility treatment, so far resulting in the birth of one set of twin girls. He says he used the tool known as CRISPR to delete the embryos’ CCR5 gene (C-C motif chemokine receptor 5), mutations in which are linked to resistance to HIV infection.The media is buzzing with the surprise news that a Chinese researcher, Jiankui He, has created the world’s first genome-edited twins. He did this, ostensibly, to provide resistance to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Prof. He, reportedly working with former Rice University supervisor Michael Deem, capitalized on work in 2012 by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuel Charpentier, who introduced a new and easier way of altering the DNA of human and non-human organisms using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. He also built upon the work of molecluar biologist Feng Zhang, who optimized this genome editing system for use in human cells. He’s claim moves human germline genome editing from the lab to the delivery room — something other scientists might have been thinking about despite ethical concern. Jiankui He explains why his lab edited the genome of twin baby girls, Nana and Lulu, when they were embryos. If true, this is a significant advance in genetic science, but there are some very serious problems with this news. First, the research has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal so we cannot be sure of the exact details of what has been done. Instead, the scientist made the claims to the Associated Press news organization, and the journalists involved haven’t been able to independently verify them. The parents of the allegedly gene-edited babies declined to be interviewed or identified.Second, we know there can be significant problems with using existing gene-editing technology on human embryos. The main two issues are mosaicism, where the edited DNA does not appear in every cell of the embryo, and off-target effects, where other parts of the genome may also have been edited with unknown consequences. The scientific community has expressed widespread condemnation ofHe’s decision to initiate a pregnancy using genetically modified embryos — as “dangerous, ""irresponsible” and “crazy.” What if mistakes are made? How can we be sure this powerful technology will benefit humankind? Are we ready for the consequences of genetically engineering our own evolution? We argue that we cannot allow individual scientists to decide the fate of the human genome. Heritable human genome editing poses a significant existential threat because changes may persist throughout the human population for generations, with unknown risks. We must commit to inclusive global dialogue — involving experts and the public — to develop broad societal consensus on what to do with genetic technologies. Possible mutations or forced sterilization:He announced to the world that he edited the genome of human embryos for seven couples using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. According to He, two of these embryos resulted in a pregnancy, and twin girls (Lulu and Nana, which are pseudonyms) were born. The goal of the editing was to confer resistance to HIV by modifying the CCR5 gene (the protein doorway by which HIV enters human cells). He claims that these edits have been verified in both twins and this data has been looked over and called “probably accurate”” by George Church, a world-renowned Harvard geneticist. Evidence suggests, however, the procedure was unnecessary, is unlikely to provide benefit and could even cause harm. Although the father of Lulu and Nana was HIV positive, it is unlikely that he would have passed this disease to his children using standard IVF procedures. The children born of genome editing are genetic mosaics with uncertain resistance to HIV and perhaps decreased resistance to viral diseases like influenza and West Nile. This is because the CCR5 gene that He disabled plays an important role in resistance to these diseases. As well, there is the possibility of unintended mutations caused by the CRISPR procedure. These health risks cannot be overstated, as the repercussions for these twin girls, in terms of their susceptibility to infectious diseases or cancer will likely be a cause for concern throughout their lives. Another uncertain consequence for the twins concerns their reproductive health and freedom. As they approach reproductive age will they face the possibility of “forced” sterilization to prevent their edited genes being passed on to future generations? Before genome editing becomes a clinical treatment, it is essential that scientists resolve both of these issues and eliminate other potential adverse effects on the embryo. We need comprehensive studies to show that genome editing is not going to cause harm to the future people it helps create. Any children born as a result of genome editing will also need long-term follow up. It would be vital to see the preliminary work that He has done to confirm that his technique has eliminated mosaicism and off-target effects, and it is surprising that he has not published this. There is also a question over why gene-editing was used to tackle the particular issue of HIV transmission in this case. The reports suggest that the couples involved in the study were made up of HIV-positive men who had the infection under control and HIV-negative women. The risk of transmission of HIV for these couples would have been negligible, and there are well-established ways to prevent HIV transmission to the offspring of HIV-positive couples. Do we really need gene editing?Most reports suggest that the potential main use of genome editing would be therapeutic genome editing to prevent the transmission of genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis. In most cases, couples at risk of transmitting a genetic disease to their children are able to prevent transmission using established techniques of screening before birth or even before an embryo is implanted via IVF. So perhaps editing embryos for therapeutic reasons is not the way forward. Designer babies by powerful elites:With the Genetic Genie out of the bottle, we have to ask whether we need any more time to reflect on the ethics.A just and fair society is one with less disparity and more justice. A predictable consequence of allowing individuals to genetically modify their children will be greater disparity and greater injustice — and not only because of limited access to genome editing technology. Whether He’s claims are true or not, this whole situation is a disservice to the entire field of research, and to potential future recipients of CRISPR-based therapies. Finally, there is the wider ethical debate, which the scientist in this case has chosen to ignore. As a Medical Sociologist, Research Ethicist and Board Member of Institutional Review Board (IRB), my conclusion is that we need a public debate before gene editing on embryos was carried out because this procedure takes reproduction to a new level. With all this in mind, any research in this area needs to be peer-reviewed and published in the scientific literature, with all the necessary preliminary work, so that we can make a valued analysis of the technique. In bypassing this process, He has made our job much harder.

India hospital transfusions infect thousands with HIV,,,,,"India hospital transfusions infect thousands with HIV At least 2,234 Indians have contracted HIV while receiving blood transfusions in hospitals in the past 17 months alone, say officials. The information was revealed by the countrys National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) in response to a petition filed by information activist Chetan Kothari. Mr Khothari told the BBC that he was ""shocked"" by the revelation. India has more than two million people living with HIV/Aids. The highest number of patients who had been infected with HIV as a result of contaminated blood in hospitals, were from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh with 361 cases, Mr Kotharis RTI (Right to Information) query revealed. The western states of Gujarat with 292 cases and Maharashtra with 276 cases rank second and third respectively. The Indian capital Delhi is at number four with 264 cases.

In this context, they viewed that most of the infected patients are subjected to repression, discrimination and negligence every spheres of their existence which is gross violence of the human rights. They said the anomalous situation could be addressed after creating mass awareness as the patients have equal rights to survive after deriving total benefits of all the state facilities. Civil Surgeon Office organised the discussion in association with various NGOs and voluntary organisations concerned held at EPI Store premises to mark the World AIDS Day-2015 in the city. ""Getting Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Discriminations and Zero AIDS Related Deaths"" was the main theme of the day. Additional Deputy Commissioner (General) Ataul Gani addressed the discussion as chief guest with Civil Surgeon of Rajshahi Dr Abdus Sobhan in the chair. Deputy Civil Surgeon Dr Farhana Haque, Senior Health Education Officer Sazzad Hossain, Junior Health Education Officer Abdur Rahman and Executive Director of Asakta Punarbashan Sangstha Abdul Bashar Paltu also spoke. Chief Guest Ataul Gani emphasized the need for protecting the infected persons from their human rights violations as they are also the integral part of the society. He stated that the universal access is a commitment to scale up access to HIV treatment, prevention, care and support with the cooperation from government development partners and civil society. Terming the rights-based responses to the infected persons as practical and effective the discussant said that universal access will never be achieved without ensuring human rights as human rights violations increase social marginalization and risk of HIV.

The scientists found that on the HIV envelope protein, at a site important for viral function, a small group of sugar molecules, known as glycans, serves as a key ""anchor"" for antibodies that can broadly neutralize the virus. Future candidate vaccines are therefore likely to include this glycan cluster among their specific viral targets in order to maximize the chances of stimulating an effective antibody response. ""We learned in this study that grabbing hold of these glycans can be a very important early step in an effective immune response to HIV, and with this knowledge, we believe we can design better candidate vaccines,"" said principal investigator Dennis R. Burton, professor of immunology and microbiology at TSRI. The research, published in the September issue of Immunity, is part of a broad reverse-engineering effort by scientists around the world to use antibodies isolated from HIV-infected people to guide the development of a successful vaccine. This approach represents a departure from traditional vaccine designs, which have been developed and tested against HIV in vulnerable populations since the mid-1980s without success. HIV is a hugely variable virus having many hundreds of thousands of different strains. Traditional vaccines generally only attack one strain of the virus and so are typically ineffective in a real-world situation. In studying the blood of HIV-infected people, scientists have succeeded in identifying a small number of antibodies which act against many different strains of HIV. These ""broadly neutralizing"" antibodies (bnAbs) manage to hit structures on the virus that do not vary much, typically because the structures are needed for some critical viral function. Some bnAbs can block infection by nearly all HIV strains. However, bnAbs are found in only a minority of infected people, in quantities too small to clear the virus, so Burton and other researchers are now trying to design vaccines to elicit these bnAbs in numbers large enough to provide effective protection. In the study, TSRI scientists, including first author Raiees Andrabi, a postdoctoral research associate in the Burton Laboratory, focused on a particularly potent family of bnAbs, known as VRC26, which were isolated several years ago from blood obtained in South Africa from an HIV-infected person (code-named CAP256). VRC26 antibodies neutralize HIV by fastening to a region of the viral envelope protein known as the V2 apex. This is thought to prevent the viral envelope structure from changing its shape to enable infection of host cells. VRC26 antibodies bind specifically to a hard-to-reach but relatively unvarying viral protein sequence, as well as to two nearby glycans. One of the great challenges in reverse-engineering an HIV vaccine from bnAbs, such as VRC26, comes from the fact that the immune system cannot produce these antibodies immediately after vaccination. A persons initial pool of B cells—the cells that produce antibodies—may include some that bind weakly to the same V2 apex target on HIV. But only after engaging the target and adjusting their antigen receptors over many generations (as B cells do by mutating their antigen receptor genes) can this lineage of cells produce VRC26 bnAbs. Thus, in principle, a successful vaccine has to stimulate the first B cells in this lineage and then coax them along a fairly narrow evolutionary path until they have changed enough to provide effective protection against HIV. Andrabi therefore analyzed how B cells in the VRC26 lineage changed in CAP256s blood in the course of HIV infection. The major finding was that an early and strengthening attachment to the glycans at the V2 target site appeared to be very important. Without it, B cells were much more likely to veer off the VRC26 path and never produce bnAbs. ""These glycans essentially provided an anchor for antibodies in this lineage as the surrounding viral proteins changed,"" Andrabi said. ""The virus therefore couldnt escape, and ultimately, as the VRC26 B cells evolved, their antibodies became more and more broadly neutralizing."" The finding that the V2 apex glycans are important for VRC26 bnAb development suggests that vaccines targeting this region should elicit antibodies that bind to these glycans. ""Maturation of antibody-producing B cells along this glycan-related pathway may be critical for the induction of an effective VRC26 response through vaccination,"" Andrabi said. The TSRI scientists are continuing to study bnAbs against HIV for clues to an effective vaccine design, but as new candidate vaccines are developed, targeting V2 apex glycans is likely to be a high priority. ""The proof will come when we test new designs in immunization experiments,"" Burton said. HIV, which can cause the fatal immune-deficiency syndrome known as AIDS, is estimated to infect about 1 million people in the U.S. and 35 million people worldwide. Antiviral drugs can keep AIDS at bay indefinitely, but do not clear HIV infection, and so far there is no preventive vaccine.",{},"['successful', 'study', 'cells', 'b', 'hiv', 'vaccines', 'reveals', 'vaccine', 'vrc26', 'work', 'virus', 'glycans', 'clues', 'antibodies', 'bnabs', 'viral']","Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have made a discovery that could speed efforts to develop a successful HIV vaccine.

He was one of 18 people in a small trial testing injections of ""broadly neutralising antibodies"" - the natural weapons of the immune system. They delayed the resurgence of the virus in other participants by around two weeks. The findings are being presented at the ninth International Aids Society Conference on HIV Science in Paris. The human body is inefficient at making antibodies that neutralise HIV.Only one in five people infected with the virus develops them - and even then it takes many years and high levels of uncontrolled virus. But more than 200 broadly neutralising antibodies have been documented, which doctors hope could be useful for both preventing and treating HIV. Antibody infusion The trial in Thailand, led by the US Military HIV Research Program (MHRP), took people who were controlling their infection with their standard HIV medication. Some were given no treatment and others had an infusion of the antibody - codenamed VRC01 - into their bloodstream. Inevitably the virus came back in those getting no treatment. It took an average (median) of 14 days, at which point they were put back on antiretroviral therapy. In those receiving the antibody it took 26 days. Dr Jintanat Ananworanich, one of the MHRP scientists, said there was also the exceptional case. She told the BBC News website: ""[The patient] has been off treatment for around 10 months and has so far controlled the virus to very low levels."" He had the antibody infusion every three weeks for six months. The field is still at an incredibly early stage, but the results point to the potential of antibody-based therapies. Dr Ananworanich added: ""It suggests theres some impact from the antibody, but how the antibody actually impacts the virus and the immune system - thats an on-going investigation. ""I do think antibody therapy has potential because the antibody, in the future, could perhaps be given just two or three times a year."" Immune booster Animal research has suggested antibodies could have a greater impact than conventional therapies because as well as attacking the virus they also train the immune system. When the antibody binds to HIV in monkey studies, they form an ""immune complex"" which other parts of the immune system might be able to recognise. Dr Ananworanich told the BBC: ""That perhaps stimulates the other arms of the immune system, like the T-cells, to better react to HIV - and in that monkey study the monkeys went into remission."" The next stage of the research is to go through all the blood samples collected during the trial to identify how the therapy affected both the immune system and the virus. HIV is such a difficult virus to treat - it mutates constantly - that any future therapy would probably require multiple broadly neutralising antibodies. However, antibodies are not a simple chemical. They are an intricate piece of immune biology, and that makes them expensive to manufacture. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: ""Antibodies are generally more expensive because theyre biologics and theyre more complicated to make than small molecules. ""But if we get an antibody that works I can guarantee you we can probably rev it up from a production standpoint to bring the costs down dramatically [so] that it would be available.""",{},"['mans', 'trial', 'hiv', 'immune', 'therapy', 'took', 'virus', 'months', 'treatment', 'antibodies', 'antibody', 'helps', 'bay', 'system']","An experimental therapy has held back one man's HIV infection for 10 months, doctors have reported.

Some 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030, according to the new Unicef report. This means, the report said, 76 adolescent deaths every day - without additional investment in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) prevention, testing and treatment programmes. In 2017, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Bangladesh reported that among the 865 new reported cases, more than 5 percent were children and adolescents less than 18 years and 25 percent were women. Unicef Bangladesh and National HIV Programme of the government are working for sustainability and scaling up of the services on prevention of Mother to child transmission, HIV prevention, treatment and care for most at risk adolescents, protection, care and treatment of children affected by AIDS. The report -- Children, HIV and AIDS: The World in 2030 -- noted that based on population projections, and at current trends, the number of 19 year-olds newly-infected with HIV will reach an estimated 270,000 in 2030, decreasing by one third over current estimates. It showed that the number of children and adolescents dying from AIDS-related causes will decline, from a current 119,000 to 56,000 in 2030. However, this downward trajectory is too slow, particularly among adolescents. According to the report, by 2030, the number of new HIV infections among children in the first decade of life will be cut in half, while new infections among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years old will only decrease by 29 per cent. AIDS-related deaths are projected to decrease by 57 per cent among children below the age of 14, compared with a 35 per cent decrease among those aged 15 to 19 years. ""The report makes it clear, without the shadow of a doubt, that the world is off track when it comes to ending AIDS among children and adolescents by 2030,"" said Henrietta Fore, Unicef Executive Director. ""Programmes to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to babies are paying off but havent gone far enough, while programmes to treat the virus and prevent it from spreading among older children are nowhere near where they should be."" Unicef estimates that nearly 700 adolescents aged between 10 and 19 are newly infected with HIV every day - or one every two minutes. According to the report, by 2030, the number of new HIV infections among children in the first decade of life will be cut in half, while new infections among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years old will only decrease by 29 percent. The report also noted that an estimated 1.9 million children and adolescents will still be living with HIV in 2030, mostly in Eastern and Southern Africa (1.1 million), followed by West and Central Africa (571,000), and Latin America and the Caribbean (84,000). Currently, 3 million children and adolescents are living with HIV around the world, more than half of them in Eastern and Southern Africa. Reductions in the number of 0-19 year-olds living with HIV between 2018 and 2030 will also vary by region, with the greatest decline in South Asia (close to 50 percent) and Eastern and Southern Africa (40 per cent). By contrast, that number will only decline by 24 percent in Central and Western Africa, the region with the second highest burden. The report points to two major “shortfalls” in the HIV response for children and adolescents: Slow progress in preventing HIV among young children, and a failure to address the structural and behavioural drivers of the epidemic. Many children and adolescents do not know whether they have HIV or not, and among those who have been found HIV-positive and put on treatment, very few adhere to that treatment. To address these persistent gaps, the report recommends a number of approaches, supported by UNICEF, including: family-centred testing to help identify and treat children living with HIV but not yet diagnosed; more diagnostic technologies at the point of care to improve early infant diagnosis; greater use of digital platforms to improve HIV knowledge among adolescents; adolescent-friendly services; and targeted community outreach for adolescents. “We can’t win the fight against HIV if we don’t accelerate progress in preventing transmission to the next generation,” said Fore. “We must maintain the sense of urgency to sustain gains made in the past decade - for both boys and girls. And to do this we must look to innovative and preventative ways of reaching the most vulnerable and at-risk young people.”",{},"['living', 'die', 'hiv', 'adolescents', '80', '2030', 'globally', 'unicef', '19', 'day', 'number', 'report', 'treatment', 'children', 'aids']","In Bangladesh, the HIV prevalence among general population remains low (<0.1%) while around 80 adolescents will die of AIDS globally every day by 2030 as per the current trends, said Unicef yesterday.

Not only are new HIV infections and deaths declining, but more people than ever are on life-saving treatment, according to data published ahead of an AIDS science conference opening in Paris on Sunday. ""In 2016, 19.5 million of the 36.7 million people living with HIV had access to treatment,"" said the UNAIDS global roundup. This marked the first time that more than half of infected people were receiving anti-retroviral treatment, which subdues the AIDS virus but does not kill it. ""AIDS-related deaths have fallen from 1.9 million in 2005 to one million in 2016,"" said the authors, adding that ""for the first time the scales have tipped."" The year 2016 saw 1.8 million new infections, almost half the record number of some 3.5 million in 1997, said the report. In total, 76.1 million people have been infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, since the epidemic started in the 1980s. Some 35 million have died. ""Communities and families are thriving as AIDS is being pushed back,"" said UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe. ""As we bring the epidemic under control, health outcomes are improving and nations are becoming stronger."" As yet, there is no HIV vaccine or cure, and infected people rely on lifelong anti-retroviral therapy to stop the virus replicating. Without treatment, HIV-infected people go on to develop AIDS, a syndrome that weakens the immune system and leaves the body exposed to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, and some types of cancer. Treatment carries side effects and is costly, but allows infected people to be healthier for longer. - More work to do - Most progress has been made in east and southern Africa, the region that was hardest hit by the epidemic and where many interventions were focused. Since 2010, AIDS-related deaths in the region declined by 42 percent. The region accounts for half the worlds infected population, with women and girls disproportionately affected at 60 percent.Sixty percent of all people who receive anti-retroviral therapy live in east and southern Africa which, along with west and central Europe and the Americas, is on target to meet the so-called 90-90-90 targets set by the UN, said the report. By 2020, states the plan, 90 percent of infected people must know their status, of whom 90 percent must be on treatment. In 90 percent of those, the virus will be ""suppressed"" by medicine to the extent that it cannot function or replicate. By 2016, 70 percent of infected people knew their status, said the new report. Of those, 77 percent were on treatment, and 82 percent had virus suppression. UNAIDS expressed concern about two regions with worsening AIDS trends: the Middle East-North Africa, and eastern Europe-central Asia. Both are areas marred by conflict and political uncertainty. New HIV infections rose by 60 percent in eastern Europe and central Asia, and deaths by almost a third from 2010 to 2016. In the Middle East and North Africa, the number of AIDS deaths increased by a fifth in the last six years. ""Globally, progress has been significant, but there is still more work to do,"" the authors said in a statement. ""Around 30 percent of people living with HIV still do not know their HIV status, 17.1 million people living with HIV do not have access to anti retroviral therapy, and more than half of all people living with HIV are not virally suppressed."" Of the total infected population, over two million were children younger than 15, said UNAIDS. Only 43 percent of them were on treatment. New infections among children almost halved from 300,000 in 2010 to 160,000 last year, said the report. This was partly due to more and more HIV-infected pregnant women -- 76 percent in 2016 -- having access to drugs blocking virus transmission to their offspring.",{},"['lives', 'infected', 'hiv', 'deaths', 'infections', 'turning', 'claimed', 'half', 'tide', 'virus', 'amid', '2016', 'treatment', 'million', 'aids']","AIDS claimed a million lives in 2016, almost half the 2005 toll that marked the peak of the deadly epidemic, said a UN report Thursday proclaiming ""the scales have tipped"".

The anomalous situation could be addressed after creating mass awareness through community sensitisation as the patients have equal rights to survive after deriving total benefits of all the state facilities. Civil Surgeon Dr Abdus Sobhan said a strong community support has become indispensable to free the population from stigmatised socially for protecting their fundamental rights. He said the society, as a whole, should come forward with a positive attitude towards the socially excluded people for their coexistence in the society. Emphasis should be given on integrated efforts towards ensuring human rights and healthcare to the hizra community for substantial and sustainable reduction of their existing vulnerabilities. Education, awareness and targeted information on the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS need to be widely disseminated among not only sex workers but also clients to ensure improved condom use.

WHO is also launching a new progress report ""Prevent HIV: test and treat all – WHO action for country impact"". The report shows that more than 18 million people living with HIV have access to HIV treatment, but many more lack HIV diagnosis and consequently are missing out on treatment. The global HIV epidemic claimed fewer lives in 2015 than at any point in almost twenty years. Prevention programmes reduced the number of new HIV infections per year to 2.1 million in 2015, a 35% decline in incidence since 2000. The massive expansion of antiretroviral therapy has reduced the number of people dying of HIV related causes to approximately 1.1 million 2015 – 45% fewer than in 2005. Having achieved the global target of halting and reversing the spread of HIV, world leaders have set the 2020 “Fast-Track” targets to accelerate the HIV response and to END AIDS BY 2030. On World AIDS Day 2016, WHO will be promoting these new innovative HIV testing policies, urging countries and communities deploy high-impact prevention services, and further expand early and quality treatment for all, addressing geographical disparities and leaving no one behind. The Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens peoples defence systems against infections and some types of cancer. As the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually become immunodeficient. Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count. Immunodeficiency results in increased susceptibility to a wide range of infections, cancers and other diseases that people with healthy immune systems can fight off. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from 2 to 15 years to develop depending on the individual. AIDS is defined by the development of certain cancers, infections, or other severe clinical manifestations. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash or sore throat. As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposis sarcoma, among others. Transmission HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected individuals, such as blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. Risk factors Behaviours and conditions that put individuals at greater risk of contracting HIV include: having unprotected anal or vaginal sex; having another sexually transmitted infection such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and bacterial vaginosis; sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting drugs; receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. Diagnosis Serological tests, such as RDTs or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), detect the presence or absence of antibodies to HIV-1/2 and/or HIV p24 antigen. When such tests are used within a testing strategy according to a validated testing algorithm, HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy. It is important to note that serological tests detect antibodies produced by an individual as part of their immune system to fight off foreign pathogens, rather than direct detection of HIV itself. Most individuals develop antibodies to HIV-1/2 within 28 days and therefore antibodies may not be detectable early after infection, the so-called window period. This early period of infection represents the time of greatest infectivity; however HIV transmission can occur during all stages of the infection. It is best practice to also retest all people initially diagnosed as HIV-positive before they enrol in care and/or treatment to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. HIV testing services HIV testing should be voluntary and the right to decline testing should be recognized. Mandatory or coerced testing by a health-care provider, authority or by a partner or family member is not acceptable as it undermines good public health practice and infringes on human rights. Some countries have introduced, or are considering, self-testing as an additional option. HIV self-testing is a process whereby a person who wants to know his or her HIV status collects a specimen, performs a test and interprets the test results in private. HIV self-testing does not provide a definitive diagnosis; instead, it is an initial test which requires further testing by a health worker using a nationally validated testing algorithm. All HIV testing services must include the 5 C’s recommended by WHO: informed Consent, Confidentiality, Counselling, Correct test results and Connection (linkage to care, treatment and other services). Prevention Individuals can reduce the risk of HIV infection by limiting exposure to risk factors. Key approaches for HIV prevention, which are often used in combination, include: 1. Male and female condom use Correct and consistent use of male and female condoms during vaginal or anal penetration can protect against the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Evidence shows that male latex condoms have an 85% or greater protective effect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 2. Testing and counselling for HIV and STIs Testing for HIV and other STIs is strongly advised for all people exposed to any of the risk factors. This way people learn of their own infection status and access necessary prevention and treatment services without delay. WHO also recommends offering testing for partners or couples. Additionally, WHO is recommending assisted partner notification approaches so that people with HIV receive support to inform their partners either on their own, or with the help of health care providers. 3. Testing and counselling, linkages to tuberculosis care Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common presenting illness and cause of death among people with HIV. It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV- responsible for 1 of every 3 HIV-associated deaths. Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services. Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV and active TB should be urgently started on TB treatment and ART. TB preventive therapy should be offered to people with HIV who do not have active TB. 4. Voluntary medical male circumcision Medical male circumcision, when safely provided by well-trained health professionals, reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This is a key intervention supported in 14 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. 5. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug use for prevention 5.1 Prevention benefits of ART A 2011 trial has confirmed if an HIV-positive person adheres to an effective ART regimen, the risk of transmitting the virus to their uninfected sexual partner can be reduced by 96%. The WHO recommendation to initiate ART in all people living with HIV will contribute significantly to reducing HIV transmission. 5.2 Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-negative partner Oral PrEP of HIV is the daily use of ARV drugs by HIV-uninfected people to block the acquisition of HIV. More than 10 randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PrEP in reducing HIV transmission among a range of populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples (where one partner is infected and the other is not), men who have sex with men, transgender women, high-risk heterosexual couples, and people who inject drugs. WHO recommends PrEP as a prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination prevention approaches. 5.3 Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PEP) Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the use of ARV drugs within 72 hours of exposure to HIV in order to prevent infection. PEP includes counselling, first aid care, HIV testing, and administering of a 28-day course of ARV drugs with follow-up care. WHO recommendsPEP use for both occupational and non-occupational exposures and for adults and children. 6. Harm reduction for injecting drug users People who inject drugs can take precautions against becoming infected with HIV by using sterile injecting equipment, including needles and syringes, for each injection and not sharing other drug using equipment and drug solutions. A comprehensive package of interventions for HIV prevention and treatment includes: needle and syringe programmes; opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids and other evidence based drug dependence treatment; HIV testing and counselling; risk-reduction information and education; HIV treatment and care; access to condoms; and management of STIs, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. 7. Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) The transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called vertical or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In the absence of any interventions during these stages, rates of HIV transmission from mother-to-child can be between 15-45%. MTCT can be nearly fully prevented if both the mother and the child are provided with ARV drugs throughout the stages when infection could occur. WHO recommends options for prevention of MTCT (PMTCT), which includes providing ARVs to mothers and infants during pregnancy, labour and the post-natal period, and offering life-long treatment to HIV-positive pregnant women regardless of their CD4 count. In 2015, 77% (69–86%) of the estimated 1.4 (1.3-1.6) million pregnant women living with HIV globally received effective ARV drugs to avoid transmission to their children. A growing number of countries are achieving very low rates of MTCT and some (Armenia, Belarus, Cuba and Thailand) have been formally validated for elimination of MTCT of HIV. Several countries with a high burden of HIV infection are closing in on that goal. Treatment HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but controls viral replication within a persons body and allows an individuals immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections. In 2016, WHO released the second edition of the ""Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection.” These guidelines present several new recommendations, including the recommendation to provide lifelong ART to all children, adolescents and adults, including all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV, regardless of CD4 cell count. WHO has also expanded earlier recommendations to offer PrEP to selected people at substantial risk of acquiring HIV. Alternative first-line treatment regimens are recommended, including an integrase inhibitor as an option in resource-limited settings and reduced dosage of a key recommended first-line drug, efavirenz, to improve tolerability and reduce costs. By mid-2016, 18.2.0 million people living with HIV were receiving ART globally which meant a global coverage of 46% (43–50%). Based on WHO’s new recommendations, to treat all people living with HIV and offer antiretroviral drugs as an additional prevention choice for people at ""substantial"" risk, the number of people eligible for antiretroviral treatment increases from 28 million to all 36.7 million people. Expanding access to treatment is at the heart of a new set of targets for 2020 which aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. WHO response The Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly endorsed a new ""Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV for 2016-2021"". The strategy includes 5 strategic directions that guide priority actions by countries and by WHO over the next six years. The strategic directions are: Information for focused action (know your epidemic and response). Interventions for impact (covering the range of services needed) Delivering for equity (covering the populations in need of services). Financing for sustainability (covering the costs of services). Innovation for acceleration (looking towards the future). WHO is a cosponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS). Within UNAIDS, WHO leads activities on HIV treatment and care, HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, and jointly coordinates with UNICEF the work on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

The International Aids Society has heralded the finding as an “exciting breakthrough.” A new study has produced an antibody thats able to kill off 99 percent of HIV strains. The protein is made up of three broadly neutralizing antibodies, and it is said to be more effective than any naturally occurring antibody thats been discovered The human body has difficulty fighting HIV because of the way that the virus changes and mutates — a single patient can have numerous unique strains of the infection present in their body simultaneously. However, a slim minority of people who suffer from HIV eventually develop a means of battling back in the form of broadly neutralizing antibodies. These proteins are capable of killing off numerous HIV strains at once, so for this joint study between NIH and Sanofi, researchers set out to find a way to harness this natural defense. To that end, they combined three unique antibodies to produce a tri-specific antibody. While the most effective naturally occurring antibodies can only target 90 percent of HIV strains, this tri-specific antibody was observed to take on 99 percent. It was even successful at low concentrations. Furthermore, an experiment in which 24 monkeys were administered with the antibodies and then injected with the virus didn’t result in a single infection. As Sanofi’s Dr. Gary Nabel told the BBC, “[The tri-specific antibodies] are more potent and have greater breadth than any single naturally occurring antibody that’s been discovered.” The next step to putting these powerful antibodies to work is a clinical trial, which is expected to get underway in 2018. Still much to do Over the last few decades, we have seen some amazing advances in the fight against HIV. These range from the various treatment methods that are now available to the hugely successful educational campaign that’s been carried out in Africa. Truly, no stone is being left unturned in the search for better HIV treatments. Scientists in South Africa are investigating the case of a nine-year-old child who was seemingly cured of HIV after receiving antiretroviral therapy. Another study saw researchers look into cows’ ability to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies with the goal of using them to combat the virus. With any luck, methodology will continue to improve at a fast pace. At the end of 2015, 36.7 million people around the world were living with HIV/AIDS, so clearly a lot more work needs to be done. However, this new research project and others like it could lead to the next level of advancements with regards to the virus.

Gut bacteria may play role in immune recovery of HIV patients,,,,,"Gut bacteria may play role in immune recovery of HIV patients An international study coordinated by Spanish research institutes has found that gut bacteria also play their role in the immune recovery of HIV patients. Researchers from the University of Valencia (UV) have taken part in a study analysing the influence of gut bacteria on immune recovery in HIV-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment (ART). They have discovered a correlation between immune recovery and the behaviour of a certain subset of gut bacteria in reponse to treatment. Interestingly, this behaviour appears to be both a consequence and a cause of recovery. The implications of this finding are that new complementary therapies could be developed that target these bacteria to boost the efficiency of ART and prevent the complications associated with immune deficiency and chronic inflammation. ""HIV patients suffer from persistent immune deficiencies and chronic intestinal inflammation caused, in part, by the very toxins released by the cells to fight off the HIV infection. In this study we have found that, in some patients, certain gut bacteria become activated during ART and begin to amass anti-inflammatory molecules"", explains CSIC researcher Manuel Ferrer of the Catalysis Institute. The immune recovery of these ""ART responders"" is much better than that of their peers, the make-up and behaviour of whose gut bacteria does not lead to the same anti-inflammatory effect. In the study, the researchers analysed the gut bacteria found in the faecal matter of healthy subjects and HIV patients undergoing different intensities of infection control and immune recovery. Specifically, they studied the activity levels of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (the intestinal flora). The results suggest a correlation between bacterial activity and immune response as a consequence of HIV and antiretroviral treatment. ""The make-up and behaviour of the gut bacteria of HIV patients whose body responds adequately to antiretrovirals are different to those who respond less well to treatment. It is possible that the reason why some subjects respond better to antiretrovirals is because their immune system is predisposed to these beneficial, recovery-enabling bacteria,"" adds researcher Sergio Serrano-Villar at Hospital Ramón y Cajal. So gut bacteria appear to play a role in successful immune recovery in HIV-infected individuals. Antriretroviral treatments could therefore have a greater impact on HIV patients health if combined with therapies that target this subset of bacteria. ""The design of new probiotic foods could be an option, for instance"" (Ferrer). The results of the study, published in eBioMedicine journal, could help in the design of new therapies for the prevention of complications associated with immunodepression and chronic inflammation, such as diseases associated with ageing that appear earlier and more frequently in people with HIV.

If true, it would be a profound leap of science and ethics. A U.S. scientist said he took part in the work in China, but this kind of gene editing is banned in the United States because the DNA changes can pass to future generations and it risks harming other genes. Many mainstream scientists think it’s too unsafe to try, and some denounced the Chinese report as human experimentation. The researcher, He Jiankui of Shenzhen, said he altered embryos for seven couples during fertility treatments, with one pregnancy resulting thus far. He said his goal was not to cure or prevent an inherited disease, but to try to bestow a trait that few people naturally have — an ability to resist possible future infection with HIV, the AIDS virus. He said the parents involved declined to be identified or interviewed, and he would not say where they live or where the work was done. There is no independent confirmation of He’s claim, and it has not been published in a journal, where it would be vetted by other experts. He revealed it Monday in Hong Kong to one of the organizers of an international conference on gene editing that is set to begin Tuesday, and earlier in exclusive interviews with The Associated Press. “I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make a first, but also make it an example,” He told the AP. “Society will decide what to do next” in terms of allowing or forbidding such science. Some scientists were astounded to hear of the claim and strongly condemned it. It’s “unconscionable ... an experiment on human beings that is not morally or ethically defensible,” said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert and editor of a genetics journal. “This is far too premature,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who heads the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. “We’re dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It’s a big deal.” However, one famed geneticist, Harvard University’s George Church, defended attempting gene editing for HIV, which he called “a major and growing public health threat.” “I think this is justifiable,” Church said of that goal. In recent years scientists have discovered a relatively easy way to edit genes, the strands of DNA that govern the body. The tool, called CRISPR-cas9, makes it possible to operate on DNA to supply a needed gene or disable one that’s causing problems. It’s only recently been tried in adults to treat deadly diseases, and the changes are confined to that person. Editing sperm, eggs or embryos is different — the changes can be inherited. In the U.S., it’s not allowed except for lab research. China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing. He Jiankui (HEH JEE’-an-qway), who goes by “JK,” studied at Rice and Stanford universities in the U.S. before returning to his homeland to open a lab at Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, where he also has two genetics companies. The U.S. scientist who worked with him on this project after He returned to China was physics and bioengineering professor Michael Deem, who was his adviser at Rice in Houston. Deem also holds what he called “a small stake” in — and is on the scientific advisory boards of — He’s two companies. The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods. He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell. All of the men in the project had HIV and all of the women did not, but the gene editing was not aimed at preventing the small risk of transmission, He said. The fathers had their infections deeply suppressed by standard HIV medicines and there are simple ways to keep them from infecting offspring that do not involve altering genes. Instead, the appeal was to offer couples affected by HIV a chance to have a child that might be protected from a similar fate. He recruited couples through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. Its leader, known by the pseudonym “Bai Hua,” told the AP that it’s not uncommon for people with HIV to lose jobs or have trouble getting medical care if their infections are revealed. Here is how He described the work: The gene editing occurred during IVF, or lab dish fertilization. First, sperm was “washed” to separate it from semen, the fluid where HIV can lurk. A single sperm was placed into a single egg to create an embryo. Then the gene editing tool was added. When the embryos were 3 to 5 days old, a few cells were removed and checked for editing. Couples could choose whether to use edited or unedited embryos for pregnancy attempts. In all, 16 of 22 embryos were edited, and 11 embryos were used in six implant attempts before the twin pregnancy was achieved, He said. Tests suggest that one twin had both copies of the intended gene altered and the other twin had just one altered, with no evidence of harm to other genes, He said. People with one copy of the gene can still get HIV, although some very limited research suggests their health might decline more slowly once they do. Several scientists reviewed materials that He provided to the AP and said tests so far are insufficient to say the editing worked or to rule out harm. They also noted evidence that the editing was incomplete and that at least one twin appears to be a patchwork of cells with various changes. “It’s almost like not editing at all” if only some of certain cells were altered, because HIV infection can still occur, Church said. Church and Musunuru questioned the decision to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, because the Chinese researchers said they knew in advance that both copies of the intended gene had not been altered. “In that child, there really was almost nothing to be gained in terms of protection against HIV and yet you’re exposing that child to all the unknown safety risks,” Musunuru said. The use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ “main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease,” Church said. Even if editing worked perfectly, people without normal CCR5 genes face higher risks of getting certain other viruses, such as West Nile, and of dying from the flu. Since there are many ways to prevent HIV infection and it’s very treatable if it occurs, those other medical risks are a concern, Musunuru said. There also are questions about the way He said he proceeded. He gave official notice of his work long after he said he started it — on Nov. 8, on a Chinese registry of clinical trials. It’s unclear whether participants fully understood the purpose and potential risks and benefits. For example, consent forms called the project an “AIDS vaccine development” program. The Rice scientist, Deem, said he was present in China when potential participants gave their consent and that he “absolutely” thinks they were able to understand the risks. Deem said he worked with He on vaccine research at Rice and considers the gene editing similar to a vaccine. “That might be a layman’s way of describing it,” he said. Both men are physics experts with no experience running human clinical trials. The Chinese scientist, He, said he personally made the goals clear and told participants that embryo gene editing has never been tried before and carries risks. He said he also would provide insurance coverage for any children conceived through the project and plans medical follow-up until the children are 18 and longer if they agree once they’re adults. Further pregnancy attempts are on hold until the safety of this one is analyzed and experts in the field weigh in, but participants were not told in advance that they might not have a chance to try what they signed up for once a “first” was achieved, He acknowledged. Free fertility treatment was part of the deal they were offered. He sought and received approval for his project from Shenzhen Harmonicare Women’s and Children’s Hospital, which is not one of the four hospitals that He said provided embryos for his research or the pregnancy attempts. Some staff at some of the other hospitals were kept in the dark about the nature of the research, which He and Deem said was done to keep some participants’ HIV infection from being disclosed. “We think this is ethical,” said Lin Zhitong, a Harmonicare administrator who heads the ethics panel. Any medical staff who handled samples that might contain HIV were aware, He said. An embryologist in He’s lab, Qin Jinzhou, confirmed to the AP that he did sperm washing and injected the gene editing tool in some of the pregnancy attempts. The study participants are not ethicists, He said, but “are as much authorities on what is correct and what is wrong because it’s their life on the line.” “I believe this is going to help the families and their children,” He said. If it causes unwanted side effects or harm, “I would feel the same pain as they do and it’s going to be my own responsibility.”",{},"['participants', 'research', 'hiv', 'china', 'geneedited', 'gene', 'claimed', 'embryos', 'pregnancy', 'babies', 'human', 'chinese', 'editing', 'risks']","China outlaws human cloning but not specifically gene editing.

World AIDS Day 2017: everybody counts,,,,,"World AIDS Day 2017: everybody counts WHO In 2015, global leaders signed up to the Sustainable Development Goals, with the aim to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030. The UHC framework now lies at the centre of all health programmes. To complement the global World AIDS Day 2017 campaign which promotes the theme ""Right to health"", the World Health Organization will highlight the need for all 36.7 million people living with HIV and those who are vulnerable and affected by the epidemic, to reach the goal of universal health coverage. Key messages to achieve univeral health coverage • Leave no one behind. • HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis services are integrated. • High-quality services are available for those with HIV. • People living with HIV have access to affordable care. • The HIV response is robust and leads to stronger health systems Under the slogan ""Everybody counts"", WHO will advocate for access to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines, including medicines, diagnostics and other health commodities as well as health care services for all people in need, while also ensuring that they are protected against financial risks. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens peoples defence systems against infections and some types of cancer. As the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually become immunodeficient. Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count. Immunodeficiency results in increased susceptibility to a wide range of infections, cancers and other diseases that people with healthy immune systems can fight off. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which can take from 2 to 15 years to develop depending on the individual. AIDS is defined by the development of certain cancers, infections, or other severe clinical manifestations. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to be most infectious in the first few months, many are unaware of their status until later stages. The first few weeks after initial infection, individuals may experience no symptoms or an influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash, or sore throat. As the infection progressively weakens the immune system, an individual can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe illnesses such as tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections and cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposis sarcoma, among others. Transmission HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of a variety of body fluids from infected individuals, such as blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. Individuals cannot become infected through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. Risk factors Behaviours and conditions that put individuals at greater risk of contracting HIV include: having unprotected anal or vaginal sex; having another sexually transmitted infection such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and bacterial vaginosis; sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment and drug solutions when injecting drugs; receiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, tissue transplantation, medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; and experiencing accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. Diagnosis Serological tests, such as RDTs or enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), detect the presence or absence of antibodies to HIV-1/2 and/or HIV p24 antigen. No single HIV test can provide an HIV-positive diagnosis. It is important that these tests are used in combination and in a specific order that has been validated and is based on HIV prevalence of the population being tested. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy, using WHO prequalified tests within a validated approach. It is important to note that serological tests detect antibodies produced by an individual as part of their immune system to fight off foreign pathogens, rather than direct detection of HIV itself. Most individuals develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection and therefore antibodies may not be detectable early, during the so-called window period. This early period of infection represents the time of greatest infectivity; however HIV transmission can occur during all stages of the infection. HIV/AIDS Fact sheet Key facts • HIV continues to be a major global public health issue, having claimed more than 35 million lives so far. In 2016, 1.0 million people died from HIV-related causes globally. • There were approximately 36.7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016 with 1.8 million people becoming newly infected in 2016 globally. • 54% of adults and 43% of children living with HIV are currently receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). • Global ART coverage for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV is high at 76% . • The WHO African Region is the most affected region, with 25.6 million people living with HIV in 2016. The African region also accounts for almost two thirds of the global total of new HIV infections. • HIV infection is often diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies. Most often these tests provide same-day test results, which are essential for same day diagnosis and early treatment and care. • Key populations are groups who are at increased risk of HIV irrespective of epidemic type or local context. They include: men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, people in prisons and other closed settings, sex workers and their clients, and transgender people. • Key populations often have legal and social issues related to their behaviours that increase vulnerability to HIV and reduce access to testing and treatment programmes. • In 2015, an estimated 44% of new infections occurred among key populations and their partners. • There is no cure for HIV infection. However, effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can control the virus and help prevent transmission so that people with HIV, and those at substantial risk, can enjoy healthy, long and productive lives. • It is estimated that currently only 70% of people with HIV know their status. To reach the target of 90%, an additional 7.5 million people need to access HIV testing services. In 2016, 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally. • Between 2000 and 2016, new HIV infections fell by 39%, and HIV-related deaths fell by one third with 13.1 million lives saved due to ART in the same period. This achievement was the result of great efforts by national HIV programmes supported by civil society and a range of development partners. It is best practice to also retest all people initially diagnosed as HIV-positive before they enrol in care and/or treatment to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. Notably, once a person diagnosed with HIV and has started treatment they should not be retested. Testing and diagnosis of HIV-exposed infants has been a challenge. For infants and children less than 18 months of age, serological testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided (at 6 weeks of age, or as early as birth) to detect the presence of the virus in infants born to mothers living with HIV. However, new technologies are now becoming available to perform the test at the point of care and enable return of the result on the same day to accelerate appropriate linkage and treatment initiation. HIV testing services HIV testing should be voluntary and the right to decline testing should be recognized. Mandatory or coerced testing by a health care provider, authority, or by a partner or family member is not acceptable as it undermines good public health practice and infringes on human rights. New technologies to help people test themselves are being introduced, with many countries implementing self-testing as an additional option to encourage HIV diagnosis. HIV self-testing is a process whereby a person who wants to know his or her HIV status collects a specimen, performs a test and interprets the test results in private or with someone they trust. HIV self-testing does not provide a definitive HIV-positive diagnosis – instead, it is an initial test which requires further testing by a health worker. The sexual partners and drug injecting partners of people diagnosed with HIV infection have an increased probability of also being HIV-positive. WHO recommends assisted HIV partner notification services as a simple and effective way to reach these partners, many of whom are undiagnosed and unaware of their HIV exposure, and may welcome support and an opportunity to test for HIV. All HIV testing services must follow the 5 Cs principles recommended by WHO: informed Consent Confidentiality Counselling Correct test results Connection (linkage to care, treatment and other services). Prevention Individuals can reduce the risk of HIV infection by limiting exposure to risk factors. Key approaches for HIV prevention, which are often used in combination, are listed below. Male and female condom use Correct and consistent use of male and female condoms during vaginal or anal penetration can protect against the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Evidence shows that male latex condoms have an 85% or greater protective effect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Testing and counselling for HIV and STIs Testing for HIV and other STIs is strongly advised for all people exposed to any of the risk factors. This way people learn of their own infection status and access necessary prevention and treatment services without delay. WHO also recommends offering testing for partners or couples. Additionally, WHO is recommending assisted partner notification approaches so that people with HIV receive support to inform their partners either on their own, or with the help of health care providers. Testing and counselling, linkages to tuberculosis care Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common presenting illness and cause of death among people with HIV. It is fatal if undetected or untreated and is the leading cause of death among people with HIV, responsible for 1 of 3 HIV-associated deaths. Early detection of TB and prompt linkage to TB treatment and ART can prevent these deaths. TB screening should be offered routinely at HIV care services and routine HIV testing should be offered to all patients with presumptive and diagnosed TB. Individuals who are diagnosed with HIV and active TB should urgently start effective TB treatment (including for multidrug resistant TB) and ART. TB preventive therapy should be offered to all people with HIV who do not have active TB. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) Medical male circumcision, reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60%. This is a key prevention intervention supported in 15 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates. VMMC is also regarded as a good approach to reach men and adolescent boys who do not often seek health care services. Since the 2007 WHO recommendation for VMMC as an additional prevention strategy, nearly 15 million adolescent boys and men in ESA were provided a package of services including HIV testing and education on safer sex and condom use. Antiretroviral drug use for prevention Prevention benefits of ART HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a persons body and allows an individuals immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections. A 2011 trial has confirmed that if an HIV-positive person adheres to an effective ART regimen, the risk of transmitting the virus to their uninfected sexual partner can be reduced by 96%. The WHO recommendation to initiate ART in all people living with HIV will contribute significantly to reducing HIV transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-negative partner Oral PrEP of HIV is the daily use of ARV drugs by HIV-negative people to block the acquisition of HIV. More than 10 randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of PrEP in reducing HIV transmission among a range of populations including serodiscordant heterosexual couples (where one partner is infected and the other is not), men who have sex with men, transgender women, high-risk heterosexual couples, and people who inject drugs. WHO recommends PrEP as a prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of a combination of prevention approaches. WHO has also expanded these recommendations to HIV-negative women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PEP) Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the use of ARV drugs within 72 hours of exposure to HIV in order to prevent infection. PEP includes counselling, first aid care, HIV testing, and administration of a 28-day course of ARV drugs with follow-up care. WHO recommends PEP use for both occupational and non-occupational exposures and for adults and children. Harm reduction for people who inject and use drugs People who inject drugs can take precautions against becoming infected with HIV by using sterile injecting equipment, including needles and syringes, for each injection and not sharing drug using equipment and drug solutions. Treatment of dependence, and in particular opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids, also helps reduce the risk of HIV transmission and supports adherence to HIV treatment. A comprehensive package of interventions for HIV prevention and treatment includes: needle and syringe programmes; opioid substitution therapy for people dependent on opioids and other evidence-based drug dependence treatment; HIV testing and counselling; HIV treatment and care; risk-reduction information and education and provision of naloxone; access to condoms; and management of STIs, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis. Elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) The transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding is called vertical or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT). In the absence of any interventions during these stages, rates of HIV transmission from mother-to-child can be between 15–=45%. MTCT can be nearly fully prevented if both the mother and the baby are provided with ARV drugs as early as possible in pregnancy and during the period of breastfeeding. WHO recommends lifelong ART for all people living with HIV, regardless of their CD4 count clinical stage of disease, and this includes women who pregnant or breastfeeding. In 2016, 76% of the estimated 1.4 million pregnant women living with HIV globally received ARV treatments to prevent transmission to their children. A growing number of countries are achieving very low rates of MTCT and some (Armenia, Belarus, Cuba and Thailand) have been formally validated for elimination of MTCT of HIV as a public health problem. Several countries with a high burden of HIV infection are also progressing along the path to elimination. Treatment HIV can be suppressed by combination ART consisting of 3 or more ARV drugs. ART does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a persons body and allows an individuals immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections. In 2016, WHO released the second edition of the Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection. These guidelines recommend to provide lifelong ART to all people living with HIV, including children, adolescents and adults, pregnant and breastfeeding women, regardless of clinical status or CD4 cell count. By July 2017, 122 countries already have adopted this recommendation by mid-2017, which covers more than 90% of all PLHIV globally. The 2016 guidelines include new alternative ARV options with better tolerability, higher efficacy, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation when compared with medicines being used currently: dolutegravir and low-dose efavirenz for first-line therapy, and raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir for second-line therapy. Transition to these new ARV options has already started in more than 20 countries and is expected to improve the durability of the treatment and the quality of care of people living with HIV. Despite improvements, limited options remain for infants and young children. For this reason, WHO and partners are coordinating efforts to enable a faster and more effective development and introduction of age-appropriate pediatric formulations of antiretrovirals. In addition, 1 in 3 people living with HIV present to care with advanced disease, at low CD4 counts and at high risk of serious illness and death. To reduce this risk, WHO recommends that these patients receive a “package of care” that includes testing for and prevention of the most common serious infections that can cause death, such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis, in addition to ART. Based on WHO’s new recommendations to treat all people living with HIV, the number of people eligible for ART has increased from 28 million to all 36.7 million people living with HIV. In 2016, 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving ART globally, which meant a global coverage of 53% of adults and children. However, more efforts are needed to scale up treatment, particularly for children and adolescents. Only 43% of them were receiving ARVs at the end of 2016 and WHO is supporting countries to accelerate their efforts to timely diagnose and treat these vulnerable populations. Expanding access to treatment is at the heart of a new set of targets for 2020 which aim to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. WHO response The Sixty-ninth World Health Assembly endorsed a new Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV for 2016-2021. The strategy includes 5 strategic directions that guide priority actions by countries and by WHO over the next six years. The strategic directions are: Information for focused action (know your epidemic and response). Interventions for impact (covering the range of services needed). Delivering for equity (covering the populations in need of services). Financing for sustainability (covering the costs of services). Innovation for acceleration (looking towards the future). WHO is a cosponsor of the Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS). Within UNAIDS, WHO leads activities on HIV treatment and care, HIV and tuberculosis co-infection, and jointly coordinates with UNICEF the work on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.",{},"['living', 'counts', 'risk', 'art', 'hiv', 'testing', 'world', 'everybody', 'day', 'care', 'health', '2017', 'treatment', 'million', 'aids', 'infection']","World AIDS Day 2017: everybody countsWHOIn 2015, global leaders signed up to the Sustainable Development Goals, with the aim to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030.

The Finance Minister made the remarks while addressing the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and Pacific (ICAAP) as chief gust at the Bashundhara Convention City in the capital, reports UNB. Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammad Nasim also addressed the conference organised by the Health and Family Welfare Ministry with health secretary Syed Monjurul Islam in the chair. The Finance Minister said all have to work hard to save human life as humankind is the best of the creation. We hope this disease will be absolutely eradicated from Bangladesh by 2030. But we have to ensure that this will also be eradicated from the world as well, he said. Several hundreds of volunteers and health workers from different NGOs of different countries joined the conference. Health Minister Mohammad Nasim said his ministry will remain committed to work to prevention of AIDS and extend hands to the people working in the fields. He said the attitude of the people has to be changed towards the HIV-AIDS victims and extend hands to their helps with a positive approach. The three-day conference began at International Convention City Bashundhra on Saturday. Some one thousand representatives from 56 countries are participating in the conference. Saima Khan, officer-in-charge UNAIDS Bangladesh, said among the 4143 HIV positive cases, 600 have died meaning Bangladesh now has over 3000 HIV and AIDS patients.

 | theindependentbd.com","AFP, PARIS: People infected with a common parasitic worm may be twice as likely to acquire the HIV virus that causes AIDS, a field study from Tanzania reported Wednesday. The parasite, Wuchereria bancrofti, is found in many areas in Africa where HIV infection rates are high, and can cause elephantiasis, a disease that horribly deforms the limbs and other parts of the body. Also endemic in Asia, the western Pacific and parts of the Caribbean and South America, the parasite has infected 120 million people worldwide. The mosquito-borne worm can live in the human lymphatic system for years without symptoms emerging. The new findings, published in The Lancet medical journal, added a compelling reason for tackling elephantiasis, known to scientists as lymphatic filariasis, the authors argued. The long disease duration of W. bancrofti infectionaround 10 yearscreates an ongoing immune response, which could make people more susceptible to HIV infection, said Inge Kroidl, a tropical medicine specialist at the University of Munich in Germany. For the study, conducted between 2006 and 2011, researchers analysed 2,699 people in the Kyela district of Mbeya, southwest Tanzania. Lymphatic filariasis affects one in four people in the country, and has long been suspected as a factor driving the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were examined annually over a five year periodblood, urine, stool, and sputum samples were collected to test for HIV and W. bancrofti infection. Interviews determined if sexual activity could have heightened their risk of contracting HIV. The researchers found that people carrying the parasite were twice as likely to also have the AIDS virus. The impact was highest among adolescents and young adults. For now, the observed link is merely a correlation, with no proven cause-and-effect, the researchers pointed out. It does, however, highlight the need for an elephantiasis cure. Lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes in the past decade have focused on the reduction of transmission but made only limited efforts to cure W. bancrofti infection, Kroidl said. Prevention currently focuses on the use of bed nets and other mosquito repellents. Other infections such as chlamydia, herpes and syphilis are known to increase susceptibility to HIV. Jennifer Downs and Daniel Fitzgerald of the Center for Global Health at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, writing in a commentary, said further study was urgently needed to confirm the findings. Controlling lymphatic filariasis has the potential not only to decrease morbidity from the disease itself, but could additionally prevent incident HIV infections among the 120 million people living with this chronic infection, they said in The Lancet. Lymphatic filariasis is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of about 20 neglected tropical diseases that collectively affect more than a billion people in developing countries.",{},"['parasite', 'study', 'risk', 'hiv', 'bancrofti', 'boost', 'researchers', 'elephantiasis', 'virus', 'lymphatic', 'w', 'filariasis', 'aids', 'infection']","The new findings, published in The Lancet medical journal, added a compelling reason for tackling elephantiasis, known to scientists as lymphatic filariasis, the authors argued.

Moreover, the vaccine candidate protected against infection with an HIV-like virus in monkeys. Based on the results from this phase 1/2a clinical trial that involved nearly 400 healthy adults, a phase 2b trial has been initiated in southern Africa to determine the safety and efficacy of the HIV-1 vaccine candidate in 2,600 women at risk for acquiring HIV. This is one of only five experimental HIV-1 vaccine concepts that have progressed to efficacy trials in humans in the 35 years of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Previous HIV-1 vaccine candidates have typically been limited to specific regions of the world. The experimental regimens tested in this study are based on mosaic vaccines that take pieces of different HIV viruses and combine them to elicit immune responses against a wide variety of HIV strains. ""These results represent an important milestone. This study demonstrates that the mosaic Ad26 prime, Ad26 plus gp140 boost HIV vaccine candidate induced robust immune responses in humans and monkeys with comparable magnitude, kinetics, phenotype, and durability and also provided 67% protection against viral challenge in monkeys"", says Professor Dan Barouch, Director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA who led the study. He adds: ""These results should be interpreted cautiously. The challenges in the development of an HIV vaccine are unprecedented, and the ability to induce HIV-specific immune responses does not necessarily indicate that a vaccine will protect humans from HIV infection. We eagerly await the results of the phase 2b efficacy trial called HVTN705, or Imbokodo, which will determine whether or not this vaccine will protect humans against acquiring HIV."" Almost 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 1.8 million new cases every year. A safe and effective preventative vaccine is urgently needed to curb the HIV pandemic. In the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans, and only one has provided evidence of protection in an efficacy trial—a canarypox vector prime, gp120 boost vaccine regimen tested in the RV144 trial in Thailand lowered the rate of human infection by 31% but the effect was considered too low to advance the vaccine to common use. A key hurdle to HIV vaccine development has been the lack of direct comparability between clinical trials and preclinical studies. To address these methodological issues, Barouch and colleagues evaluated the leading mosaic adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26)-based HIV-1 vaccine candidates in parallel clinical and pre-clinical studies to identify the optimal HIV vaccine regimen to advance into clinical efficacy trials. The APPROACH trial recruited 393 healthy, HIV-uninfected adults (aged 18-50 years) from 12 clinics in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the USA between February 2015 and October 2015. Volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either one of seven vaccine combinations or a placebo, and were given four vaccinations over the course of 48 weeks. To stimulate, or prime, an initial immune response, each volunteer received an intramuscular injection of Ad26.Mos.HIV at the start of the study and again 12 weeks later. The vaccine containing mosaic HIV Env/Gag/Pol antigens was created from many HIV strains, delivered using a nonreplicating common-cold virus (Ad26). To boost the level of the bodys immune response, volunteers were given two additional vaccinations at week 24 and 48 using various combinations of Ad26.Mos.HIV or a different vaccine component called Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) with or without two different doses of clade C HIV gp140 envelope protein containing an aluminium adjuvant. Results showed that all vaccine regimens tested were capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in healthy individuals and were well tolerated, with similar numbers of local and systemic reactions reported in all groups, most of which were mild-to-moderate in severity. Five participants reported at least one vaccine-related grade 3 adverse event such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea, postural dizziness, and back pain. No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were reported. In a parallel study, the researchers assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the same Ad26-based mosaic vaccine regimens in 72 rhesus monkeys using a series repeated challenges with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)—a virus similar to HIV that infects monkeys. The Ad26/Ad26 plus gp140 vaccine candidate induced the greatest immune responses in humans and also provided the best protection in monkeys—resulting in complete protection against SHIV infection in two-thirds of the vaccinated animals after six challenges. The authors note several limitations, including the fact that that the relevance of vaccine protection in rhesus monkeys to clinical efficacy in humans remains unclear. They also note that there is no definitive immunological measurement that is known to predict protection against HIV-1 in humans. Writing in a linked Comment, Dr. George Pavlakis and Dr. Barbara Felber from the National Cancer Institute at Frederik, Maryland, USA say: ""Efficacy studies are necessary to determine protective ability in humans and also for the discovery of correlates of protection and for determining whether the same or different immune correlates apply for different vaccine regimens. It remains to be determined whether improved efficacy over RV144 will be achieved by either of the present efficacy trials (NCT02968849; NCT03060629). New vaccine concepts and vectors are in development and can progress to efficacy trials, which is an important process since development of an AIDS vaccine remains urgent. Despite unprecedented advances in HIV treatment and prophylaxis, the number of people living with HIV infection continues to increase worldwide. Implementation of even a moderately effective HIV vaccine together with the existing HIV prevention and treatment strategies is expected to contribute greatly to the evolving HIV/AIDS response. It is therefore essential that a commitment to pursue multiple vaccine development strategies continues at all stages.""

This medicine is not a cure for HIV or AIDS, but it can be used to treat HIV in adults and children who are at least 12 years old and weigh at least 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Descovy may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide. Important information Do not take Descovy if you also take other medicines that contain emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, or adefovir. Descovy may cause a serious condition called lactic acidosis. Get emergency medical help if you have even mild symptoms such as: muscle pain or weakness, numb or cold feeling in your arms and legs, trouble breathing, stomach pain, nausea with vomiting, fast or uneven heart rate, dizziness, or feeling very weak or tired. If you have hepatitis B you may develop liver symptoms after you stop taking Descovy, even months after stopping. You should not take Descovy if you are allergic to emtricitabine or tenofovir. Do not take if you also use other medicines that contain emtricitabine, tenofovir, lamivudine, or adefovir (such as Atripla, Combivir, Complera, Dutrebis, Emtriva, Epivir, Epzicom, Genvoya, Hepsera, Odefsey, Stribild, Triumeq, Trizivir, or Viread). Do not take Descovy to reduce infection risk if you are HIV-positive, if have been exposed to HIV within the past month, or if you had any symptoms (such as fever, night sweats, swollen glands, diarrhea, body aches). To make sure Descovy is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have: liver or kidney disease; osteopenia (low bone mineral density); or if you also have hepatitis B infection. Some people taking Descovy develop a serious condition called lactic acidosis. This may be more likely in women, in people who are overweight or have liver disease, and in people who have taken HIV/AIDS medication for a long time. Talk with your doctor about your risk. HIV can be passed to your baby if you are not properly treated during pregnancy. Take all of your HIV medicines as directed to control your infection. You should not breast-feed while you are using Descovy to treat or prevent HIV. Women with HIV or AIDS should not breast-feed a baby. Even if your baby is born without HIV, the virus may be passed to the baby in your breast milk. Descovy is not approved for anyone younger than 12 years old. The child receiving this medicine must weigh at least 37 pounds. Descovy side effects Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to Descovy: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

The organisation was gathering experts to discuss rules and guidelines on “ethical and social safety issues”, added Tedros, a former Ethiopian health minister. Tedros made the comments after a medical trial, which was led by Chinese scientist He Jiankui, claimed to have successfully altered the DNA of twin girls, whose father is HIV-positive, to prevent them from contracting the virus. His experiment has prompted widespread condemnation from the scientific community in China and abroad, as well as a backlash from the Chinese government.Tedros said the World Health Organization (WHO) was in the process of setting up the panel. He did not however characterise the initiative as a direct response to the Chinese trial. He also declined to speculate on whether WHO could envision a future where some form of gene editing could offer public health benefits. The panel will start with “a clean sheet,” Tedros said. “They can start by asking ‘should we even consider this?’” The group will include academics as well as WHO and government medical experts, he added. “We have to be very, very careful ... We should not go into gene editing without understanding the unintended consequences.” Last week, the Chinese ministry of science and technology stressed its opposition to the gene-editing baby experiment, and demanded a halt to the “scientific activities of relevant personnel”.

Ending AIDS as part of the SDGs,,,,,"TARGET 2030 Ending AIDS as part of the SDGs UNB The UN has committed to implementing a bold agenda to end the HIV-AIDS epidemic by 2030 during its General Assembly’s high-level meeting on ending the disease that ended in New York on Friday, reports UNB. The ‘progressive, new and actionable’ Political Declaration includes a set of specific, time-bound targets and actions that must be achieved by 2020 if the world is to get on the ‘fast-track’ and end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. The high-level meeting styled ‘Ending AIDS’ was convened by the President of the General Assembly and co-facilitated by Switzerland and Zambia, according to UNAIDS press statement issued from New York. Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Planning, Syed Monjurul Islam in his statement said the government of Bangladesh remains committed to end AIDS in Bangladesh by 2030 as part of its overall commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “We need to scale up case detection through mixed models for community based and provider initiated HIV testing and service integration; ensure universal access to anti-retroviral therapy; integrate prevention services with existing infrastructures to address co-infections,” he said. The number of people infected with HIV in the country stands at 4143 till November, 2015, according to government data. Fortunately, the country has not faced the brunt of the deadly disease, that has ravaged populations in some African countries. At the opening, the President of the General Assembly, Mogens Lykketoft, urged Member States to commit to action. “All stakeholders must now step up to the plate. Today is the day that we collectively say that we will end the AIDS epidemic by 2030,” said Lykketoft. “We must pay greater attention to equality and inclusion, uphold human rights and speak out against stigma and discrimination.” During the opening plenary, the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, said that the AIDS response had been a “source of innovation and inspiration,” and the Executive Director of UNAIDS outlined the progress made in recent years, with 17 million people accessing antiretroviral treatment and significant declines in AIDS-related deaths and new HIV-infections among children.",{},"['opening', '2030', 'epidemic', 'unaids', 'statement', 'sustainable', 'sdgs', 'end', 'ending', 'president', 'general', 'aids']","TARGET 2030Ending AIDS as part of the SDGsUNBThe UN has committed to implementing a bold agenda to end the HIV-AIDS epidemic by 2030 during its General Assembly’s high-level meeting on ending the disease that ended in New York on Friday, reports UNB.

And unless these threats get addressed, millions of lives will be in jeopardy. Heres a snapshot of 10 urgent health issues, according to the United Nations public health agency: Not vaccinating when you can One of the most controversial recent health topics in the US is now an international concern.""Vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases,"" WHO said. ""Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease -- it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved."" The health agency cited the recent 30% global increase in cases of measles -- a disease that had been nearly wiped out in some countries. ""The reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy,"" WHO said. ""However, some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence."" Drug-resistant superbugs Theres a dark side to the incredible success of antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials: Overuse of such treatments have led to drug-resistant superbugs. ""Now, time with these drugs is running out,"" WHO said. ""Antimicrobial resistance -- the ability of bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi to resist these medicines -- threatens to send us back to a time when we were unable to easily treat infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and salmonellosis."" About 1.6 million people die each year from tuberculosis, and many patients suffer because antibiotics dont work. ""In 2017, around 600,000 cases of tuberculosis were resistant to rifampicin -- the most effective first-line drug -- and 82% of these people had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,"" WHO said. The agency said its working on a plan to fight antimicrobial resistance by increasing awareness, reducing infection and encouraging cautious use of such drugs. Air pollution and climate change Polluted air kills 7 million people every year and about 90% of people now breathe it, WHO said. ""Microscopic pollutants in the air can penetrate respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging the lungs, heart and brain, killing 7 million people prematurely every year from diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart and lung disease,"" the agency said. ""The primary cause of air pollution (burning fossil fuels) is also a major contributor to climate change."" The UN agency said between 2030 and 2050, ""climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress."" Why climate change is the biggest risk to business (and the world) Climate change can also lead to extreme drought -- which is one reason why many Central Americans are fleeing to the United States. Another global flu pandemic WHO said it believes the world ""will face another influenza pandemic -- the only thing we dont know is when it will hit and how severe it will be."" In the United States alone, at least 13 children have died from the flu this season. This years predominant strain, H1N1, is also known as swine flu. It disproportionately affects children and adults under 50, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He said thats because similar strains were circulating about 40 to 50 years ago. ""Older people may have been infected with cousins of H1N1 years ago, and that gives them residual protection,"" Schaffner said. WHO said its constantly monitoring the circulation of flu viruses to detect potential pandemic strains. It said 153 institutions in 114 countries are involved in global surveillance and response. Crises in vulnerable places Over 1.6 billion people -- more than 1/5 of the worlds population -- live in areas of sustained crises such as drought, famine, conflict and displacement, WHO said. More than a million Syrians fleeing a gruesome civil war have sought refuge in Lebanon, only to find themselves in peril again. Devastating floods and frigid temperatures have brought more misery and death to refugees living in makeshift camps. An 8-year-old Syrian refugee recently died during a storm after the girl fell into a river and drowned. High-threat pathogens like Ebola Just when we thought Ebola was mostly under control, two separate Ebola outbreaks ravaged parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo last year. Both outbreaks spread to cities of more than 1 million people, the UN health agency said. ""This shows that the context in which an epidemic of a high-threat pathogen like Ebola erupts is critical -- what happened in rural outbreaks in the past doesnt always apply to densely populated urban areas or conflict-affected areas,"" WHO said. In addition to Ebola, scientists are prioritizing on several other hemorrhagic fevers, Zika, Nipah, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), WHO said . Non-transmissible diseases While there are plenty of fears about contagious diseases, more than 70% of all deaths worldwide are from non-transmissible diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. ""This includes 15 million people dying prematurely, aged between 30 and 69,"" WHO said. ""The rise of these diseases has been driven by five major risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and air pollution."" Dengue Something as simple as a mosquito bite can turn deadly in cases of dengue, which ""has been a growing threat for decades,"" WHO said. ""An estimated 40% of the world is at risk of dengue fever, and there are around 390 million infections a year,"" WHO said. Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and can kill up to 20% of those with severe cases, the agency said. ""A high number of cases occur in the rainy seasons of countries such as Bangladesh and India. Now, its season in these countries is lengthening significantly ... and the disease is spreading to less tropical and more temperate countries."" Weak primary health care While those with good insurance often take health care for granted, the lack of adequate primary care is rampant in many parts of the world ""Primary health care can meet the majority of a persons health needs of the course of their life,"" WHO said. ""Yet many countries do not have adequate primary health care facilities."" HIV The good news: Weve made a lot of progress in terms of HIV testing and treatment. About 22 million people are currently getting treated for HIV, WHO said, and others who are at risk of getting HIV are taking antiretroviral medications to prevent getting infected. ""However, the epidemic continues to rage with nearly a million people every year dying of HIV/AIDS,"" WHO said. About 37 million people around the world are living with HIV, the agency said.

AIDS is not a curse. Its a serious public health issue. But many people infected with AIDS are being neglected by societyits not deserving. We need to change the public perception and broaden our thinking process, he said. The president said this while addressing the inaugural ceremony of the 12th International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (ICAAP) organised by Health and Family Welfare Ministry, Bangladesh and Partners in Population and Development (PPD) at International Convention City, Bashundhara in the capital. ICAAP has been playing a pivotal role in raising public awareness, building political commitment, strengthening advocacy networks and disseminating knowledge and experiences on HIV issues among stakeholders in the region since its first congress in 1990. President Hamid said, We need further attention to find out HIV patients who are living in disguise because they seem to become a serious threat since they may spread HIV among more people. It is time for the removal of discrimination, stigmatisation and ostracising then people living with HIV/AIDS, observed Hamid adding that the plight of AIDS widows, AIDS orphans or for that matter children and spouses of people living with AIDS is very challenging. Theyre marginalised to the brims of society. It is appalling to see that it is happening in an age which boasts of pushing the boundaries of science and technology to newer levels. Inter planetary travel seems easy, but looking inwards into our own selves is tough, the president noted. About Bangladesh, President Hamid said the country has realised the importance of community resilience as a key factor in combating HIV/AIDS epidemic very early. Weve made a significant progress in mitigating the spread of HIV but theres no place for complacency. No society can be safe till all its members follow the simple rules that are essentially knowledge-based and behaviour-driven, Hamid added. Observing that Bangladesh is not a high-risk country if go by statistics, he said but considering the complexity of viral transmission, Bangladesh has accorded the highest priority to containing HIV transmission in the country as many of Bangladeshi young people are setting sail for overseas jobs around the globe every year. Therefore, we cannot allow any Bangladeshi citizen to fall victim to HIV. Not only for Bangladeshi, but also for the entire humanity we dont want to leave anyone behind. Everyone should count, the president insisted. Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammed Nasim, State Minister Zahid Maleque, Health and Family Welfare secretary Sayed Monjurul Islam and Executive Director of PPD and Secretary-General of ICAAP Joe Thomas, among others, spoke on the occasion.

It most commonly involves the tissue of the lips or the tongue. It may also occur on the: Cheek lining Floor of the mouth Gums (gingiva) Roof of the mouth (palate) Historically at least 75% of those diagnosed are tobacco users. Those who both smoke and drink alcohol have a 15 times greater risk of developing oral cancer than others. Tobacco, betel nut and paan/betel leaves chewing, in addition to smoking and alcohol abuse also contribute to oral cancer. Other factors that may increase the risk for oral cancer include: Chronic irritation (such as from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings) Human papilloma virus infection Poor dental and oral hygiene Most oral cancers could be prevented if people did not use tobacco or consume alcohol Initially, chronic irritation produces a white patch (leukoplakia) or a red patch (erythroplakia) in the mouth and these can sometimes become cancer. Submucous fibrosis, is a unique condition associated with ‘paan/ betel leaves’ chewing. It produces a burning sensation in the mouth in early stages. Later, it produces excessive scarring in the mouth that prevents the patient from opening the mouth. These patients are prone to develop oral cancers at multiple areas. Symptoms: You may notice a sore lump or ulcer which may be a deep, hard-edged crack in the mouth. It is most often pale colored, but may be dark or discoloured. It is usually painless at first (may develop a burning sensation or pain when the tumor is advanced) Other symptoms that may occur include: Abnormal taste in the mouth Chewing problems Mouth sores Pain with swallowing Speech difficulties Swallowing difficulty Tongue problems Weight loss Diagnosis Once the presence of cancer is confirmed, the stage (extent) of the disease needs to be assessed to plan the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the tumour, whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Endoscopy, CT scan and MRI give useful information to stage and plan the treatment better. PET scan can pick up disease from any part of the body with certain limitations. Cancer in these locations usually affects breathing, swallowing and speech. The aim of the treatment is to cure the patient and also to preserve and restore these vital functions. Cosmetic concerns such as facial symmetry and facial contours are also important to ensure good quality of life after cancer treatment. Treatment The choice of treatment depends mainly on general health, the location where the cancer began, the size of the tumour and whether the cancer has spread. Treatment of oral cancers is ideally a multidisciplinary approach involving the efforts of surgeons, radiation oncologists, chemotherapy oncologists, dental practitioners, nutritionists and rehabilitation and restorative specialists. The actual curative treatment modalities are usually surgery and radiation, with chemotherapy added to decrease the possibility of metastasis to sensitize the malignant cells to radiation, or for those patients who have confirmed distant metastasis of the disease. Some patients have a combination of treatments. Surgery is the main form of treatment for head and neck cancers. Numerous surgical approaches have been developed that permit preservation of organ function and facial appearance to a far greater degree than was possible in the past. Patients are usually worried about changes in the facial appearance following cancer surgery. That was the scenario in the past. Currently, when surgery is extensive, immediate reconstruction of complex defects is done by transfer of appropriate tissue from distant sites (like the forearm, thigh, leg etc.) along with their blood supply which is then reestablished using microvascular technique. With this we can bring the facial appearance as well as the functions of mouth as close to normal as possible. Prevention Visit your dentist regularly. Oral cancer may be discovered when the dentist performs a routine cleaning and examination. Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you have a sore in your mouth or lip or a lump in the neck that does not go away within 1 month. Early diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer greatly increases the chances of survival. Other preventive steps include: Avoiding smoking or other tobacco use Having dental problems corrected Limiting or avoiding alcohol use Practicing good oral hygiene.

On World AIDS Day,,,,,"On World AIDS Day Today marks the 30th celebration of World AIDS Day where people around the globe remember those who have died from the disease, celebrate the life of those living with HIV and reignite the fight to finally end this epidemic once and for all. The United Nations reports that as of 2016, 36.7 million people were living with HIV with only 53 percent of those people having access to treatment. Medical professionals know that starting treatment as soon as someone is diagnosed is the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus. This is part of UNAIDS’ ambitious goal to end the epidemic by 2020. The UNAIDS 90-90-90 plan hopes to have 90 percent of all people living with HIV know their HIV status, 90 percent of people diagnosed with HIV receiving sustained antiretroviral therapy and 90 percent of people receiving that treatment to have viral suppression by 2020. AIDS is a critical but treatable disease but even now there is a taboo surrounding it. Hushing a taboo is not an overnight task. Misinformation and misconception team up to power negative feelings and prejudice against HIV victims. Fear of expulsion from society, being deemed morally irresponsible and judgmental links to drug abuse and promiscuity -- the stigma enveloping HIV is overwhelming. Its no surprise that thousands choose silence and look the other way when its important to remember to simply begin by talking about it. However, plain talking is only half the battle. Trudge along with slow, baby steps to a more educated nation and debunk unsupported myths. HIV may very well be a viral disease but it is not contagious through physical contact such as hugs and hand-shakes, sharing food/utensils or even via air and water, for from coughs or swimming pools. Only through the contact of bodily fluids such as blood and unsterilized needles do you actually run a risk of infection. HIV is not a death sentence. It is just an infection after all. It has no cure but timely medications can keep it in check, while even boosting a healthy immune system. With the proper consultations from physicians, an HIV-positive patient can even prevent the eventual diagnosis of AIDS. The battle against HIV/AIDS is almost at the finish line. Bring it home by standing tall as a community, unanimous in support, acceptance and elimination of transmission. Only then can we champion ourselves for an AIDS-free generation.",{},"['living', 'hiv', 'way', 'talking', 'disease', '90', 'unaids', 'world', 'day', 'treatment', 'aids', 'viral']","On World AIDS DayToday marks the 30th celebration of World AIDS Day where people around the globe remember those who have died from the disease, celebrate the life of those living with HIV and reignite the fight to finally end this epidemic once and for all. The United Nations reports that as of 2016, 36.7 million people were living with HIV with only 53 percent of those people having access to treatment. Medical professionals know that starting treatment as soon as someone is diagnosed is the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus. AIDS is a critical but treatable disease but even now there is a taboo surrounding it.

Genetically engineered HIV Vaccine moves to phase I human trial,,,,,"Genetically engineered HIV Vaccine moves to phase I human trial A vaccine for HIV developed by Oregon Health Sciences University in collaboration with the California National Primate Research Center at the University of California, Davis, is moving toward clinical trials. The vaccine uses another virus, cytomegalovirus, or CMV, as a “backbone” to carry small pieces of HIV into the body and arm the immune system. OHSU hopes to enroll the first volunteers in a Phase 1 trial in the summer of 2017. The trial will look only at the safety of the vaccine, and whether it provokes an immune response in people. Peter Barry, a professor of medical microbiology at UC Davis and director of the Center for Comparative Medicine, is an expert on CMV, a type of herpes virus that infects 50 percent to 70 percent of Americans, mostly without causing disease. A version of the virus called RhCMV that can infect rhesus macaques is widely used to study diseases including CMV and HIV. Barry and postdoctoral researcher William Chang genetically engineered RhCMV so that snippets of genes from other viruses could be inserted into the virus. They shared their modifiable CMV with Professor Louis Picker at OHSU, who used this genetic backbone to create experimental vaccines against the monkey form of the AIDS virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV. Currently, there is no effective HIV vaccine but many research projects managing clinical trials seek to create one.There is evidence that a vaccine may be possible. Work with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) has shown or proven that the human body can defend itself against HIV, and certain individuals remain asymptomatic for decades after HIV infection. Potential candidates for antibodies and early stage results from clinical trials have been announced. One HIV vaccine candidate which showed some efficacy was studied in RV 144, which was a trial in Thailand beginning in 2003 and first reporting a positive result in 2009. Biosantech has developed a novel vaccine called Tat Oyi, which aims at the tat protein. It is in phase I/phase II trials. The Treatment action group has what appears to be a fairly comprehensive list of all treatments in various clinical trial stages against HIV and Aids. They also list the vaccines in trials. Up to 60 percent of rhesus macaques immunized with Picker’s vaccine at the Oregon National Primate Research Center were protected against infection with SIV — an unprecedented level of success for an SIV or HIV vaccine. Picker is now working with Barry, Professor Alice Tarantal at UC Davis and other researchers at the Center for Comparative Medicine and California National Primate Research Center to develop new versions of the vaccine based on human CMV for use in the clinical trial, and to carry out additional safety testing.

WHO on women's health,,,,,"WHO on womens health WHO Being a man or a woman has a significant impact on health, as a result of both biological and gender-related differences. The health of women and girls is of particular concern because, in many societies, they are disadvantaged by discrimination rooted in sociocultural factors. For example, women and girls face increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Some of the sociocultural factors that prevent women and girls to benefit from quality health services and attaining the best possible level of health include: unequal power relationships between men and women; Key facts • Worldwide, women live an average four years longer than men. • In 2011, womens life expectancy at birth was more than 80 years in 46 countries, but only 58 years in the WHO African Region. • Girls are far more likely than boys to suffer sexual abuse. • Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls in high- and upper-middle-income countries. • Almost all (99%) of the approximate 287 000 maternal deaths every year occur in developing countries. • Globally, cardiovascular disease, often thought to be a ""male"" problem, is the number one killer of women. • Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer among women aged 20–59 years worldwide. social norms that decrease education and paid employment opportunities; an exclusive focus on women’s reproductive roles; and potential or actual experience of physical, sexual and emotional violence. While poverty is an important barrier to positive health outcomes for both men and women, poverty tends to yield a higher burden on women and girls’ health due to, for example, feeding practices (malnutrition) and use of unsafe cooking fuels (COPD). Infancy and childhood (0-9 years) Both death rates and the causes of death are similar for boys and girls during infancy and childhood. Prematurity, birth asphyxia and infections are the main causes of death during the first month of life, which is the time of life when the risk of death is the highest. Pneumonia, prematurity, birth asphyxia and diarrhoea are the main causes of death during the first five years of life. Malnutrition is a major contributing factor in 45% of deaths in children aged less than 5 years. Adolescent girls (10-19 years) Mental health and injuries Self-inflicted injuries, road traffic injuries and drowning are among the main causes of death worldwide in adolescent girls. Depressive disorders and – in adolescents aged 15-19 years, schizophrenia – are leading causes of ill health. HIV/AIDS In 2011, about 820 000 women and men aged 15-24 were newly infected with HIV in low- and middle-income countries; more than 60% of them were women. Globally, adolescent girls and young women (15-24 years) are twice as likely to be at risk of HIV infection compared to boys and young men in the same age group. This higher risk of HIV is associated with unsafe and often unwanted and forced sexual activity. Adolescent pregnancy Early childbearing increases risks for both mothers and their newborns. Although progress has been made in reducing the birth rate among adolescents, more than 15 million of the 135 million live births worldwide are among girls aged 15-19 years. Pregnant adolescents are more likely than adults to have unsafe abortions. An estimated three million unsafe abortions occur globally every year among girls aged 15-19 years. Unsafe abortions contribute substantially to lasting health problems and maternal deaths. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are an important cause of death among girls aged 15–19 in low- and middle-income countries. Substance use Adolescent girls are increasingly using tobacco and alcohol, which risks compromising their health, particularly in later life. In some places girls are using tobacco and alcohol nearly as much as boys. For example, in the WHO Region of the Americas, 23% of boys and 21% of girls aged 13-15 reported that they used tobacco in the previous month. Nutrition In 21 out of 41 countries with data, more than one third of girls aged 15-19 years are anaemic. Anaemia, most commonly iron-deficiency anaemia, increases the risk of haemorrhage and sepsis during childbirth. It causes cognitive and physical deficits in young children and reduces productivity in adults. Women and girls are most vulnerable to anaemia due to insufficient iron in their diets, menstrual blood loss and periods of rapid growth. Reproductive age (15-44 years) and adult women (20-59 years) HIV/AIDS For women aged 15-44 years, HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death worldwide, with unsafe sex being the main risk factor in developing countries. Biological factors, lack of access to information and health services, economic vulnerability and unequal power in sexual relations expose women, particularly young women, to HIV infection. Maternal health Maternal deaths are the second biggest killer of women of reproductive age. Every year, approximately 287 000 women die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, 99% of them are in developing countries. Despite the increase in contraceptive use over the past 30 years, many women in all regions still do not have access to modern contraceptive methods. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one in four women who wish to delay or stop childbearing does not use any family planning method. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is often linked to HIV infection and is among the five leading causes of death, in low-income countries, among women of reproductive age and among adult women aged 20–59 years. Injuries Both self-inflicted injuries and road injuries figure among the top 10 causes of death among adult women (20-59 years) globally. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, burns are among the top 10 leading causes of death among women aged 15–44. Women suffer significantly more fire-related injuries and deaths than men, due to cooking accidents or as the result of intimate partner and family violence. Cervical cancer Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, with all cases linked to a sexually transmitted genital infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Due to poor access to screening and treatment services, more than 90% of deaths occur in women living in low- and middle- income countries. Violence Violence against women is widespread around the world. Recent figures indicate that 35% of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. On average, 30% of women who have been in a relationship experienced some form of physical or sexual violence by their partner. Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner. Women who have been physically or sexually abused have higher rates of mental ill-health, unintended pregnancies, abortions and miscarriages than non-abused women. Women exposed to partner violence are twice as likely to be depressed, almost twice as likely to have alcohol use disorders, and 1.5 times more likely to have HIV or another sexually transmitted infection. 42% of them have experienced injuries as a result. Increasingly in many conflicts, sexual violence is also used as a tactic of war. Depression and suicide Women are more susceptible to depression and anxiety than men. Depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. Depression following childbirth, affects 20% of mothers in low- and lower-middle-income countries, which is even higher than previous reports from high-income countries. Every year, an estimated 800 000 people die from suicide globally, the majority being men. However, there are exceptions, for instance in China where the suicide rate in rural areas is higher among women than men. Attempted suicide, which exceeds suicide by up to 20 times, is generally more frequent among women than men and causes an unrecognized burden of disability. At the same time, attempted suicide is an important risk factor for death from suicide and shows the need for appropriate health services for this group. Disabilities Disability – which affects 15% of the world’s population – is more common among women than men. Women with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education achievements, less economic participation and higher rates of poverty than women without disabilities. Adult women with disabilities are at least 1.5 times more likely to be a victim of violence than those without a disability. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Tobacco use and the burning of solid fuels for cooking are the primary risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – a life-threatening lung disease – in women. One third of all of the COPD deaths and disease burden in women is caused by exposure to indoor smoke from cooking with open fires or inefficient stoves. Older women (60 years and over) Globally, men slightly outnumber women but, as women tend to live longer than men, they represent a higher proportion of older adults: 54% of people 60 years of age and older are women, a proportion that rises to almost 60% at age 75 and older, and to 70% at age 90 and older. Noncommunicable diseases Noncommunicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancers, are the biggest causes of death among older women, regardless of the level of economic development of the country in which they live. Cardiovascular diseases account for 46% of older women’s deaths globally, while a further 14% of deaths are caused by cancers – mainly cancers of the lung, breast, colon and stomach. Chronic respiratory conditions, mainly COPD, cause another 9% of older women’s deaths. Many of the health problems faced by women in older age are the result of exposure to risk factors in adolescence and adulthood, such as smoking, sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets. Disability Other health problems experienced by older women that decrease physical and cognitive functioning include poor vision (including cataracts), hearing loss, arthritis, depression and dementia. Although men also suffer from these conditions, in many countries women are less likely to receive treatment or supportive aids than men. Older women experience more disability than men, reflecting broader determinants of health such as: inequities in norms and policies that disadvantage women; changing household structures; and higher rates of unpaid or informal sector work. These factors combine to increase vulnerabilities, and reduce access to needed and effective health services.",{},"['death', 'countries', 'risk', 'deaths', 'aged', 'women', 'girls', 'womens', 'health', 'men', 'causes']","WHO on women's healthWHOBeing a man or a woman has a significant impact on health, as a result of both biological and gender-related differences.

World's biggest health threats revealed,,,,,"Worlds biggest health threats revealed Superbugs and anti-vaxxers make WHOs list of 10 global health threats Independent Online Desk From climate change to superbugs, the World Health Organization has laid out 10 big threats to our global health in 2019. And unless these threats get addressed, millions of lives will be in jeopardy. Heres a snapshot of 10 urgent health issues, according to the United Nations public health agency: Not vaccinating when you can One of the most controversial recent health topics in the US is now an international concern.""Vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases,"" WHO said. ""Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease -- it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved."" The health agency cited the recent 30% global increase in cases of measles -- a disease that had been nearly wiped out in some countries. ""The reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy,"" WHO said. ""However, some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence."" Drug-resistant superbugs Theres a dark side to the incredible success of antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials: Overuse of such treatments have led to drug-resistant superbugs. ""Now, time with these drugs is running out,"" WHO said. ""Antimicrobial resistance -- the ability of bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi to resist these medicines -- threatens to send us back to a time when we were unable to easily treat infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and salmonellosis."" About 1.6 million people die each year from tuberculosis, and many patients suffer because antibiotics dont work. ""In 2017, around 600,000 cases of tuberculosis were resistant to rifampicin -- the most effective first-line drug -- and 82% of these people had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,"" WHO said. The agency said its working on a plan to fight antimicrobial resistance by increasing awareness, reducing infection and encouraging cautious use of such drugs. Air pollution and climate change Polluted air kills 7 million people every year and about 90% of people now breathe it, WHO said. ""Microscopic pollutants in the air can penetrate respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging the lungs, heart and brain, killing 7 million people prematurely every year from diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart and lung disease,"" the agency said. ""The primary cause of air pollution (burning fossil fuels) is also a major contributor to climate change."" The UN agency said between 2030 and 2050, ""climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress."" Why climate change is the biggest risk to business (and the world) Climate change can also lead to extreme drought -- which is one reason why many Central Americans are fleeing to the United States. Another global flu pandemic WHO said it believes the world ""will face another influenza pandemic -- the only thing we dont know is when it will hit and how severe it will be."" In the United States alone, at least 13 children have died from the flu this season. This years predominant strain, H1N1, is also known as swine flu. It disproportionately affects children and adults under 50, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He said thats because similar strains were circulating about 40 to 50 years ago. ""Older people may have been infected with cousins of H1N1 years ago, and that gives them residual protection,"" Schaffner said. WHO said its constantly monitoring the circulation of flu viruses to detect potential pandemic strains. It said 153 institutions in 114 countries are involved in global surveillance and response. Crises in vulnerable places Over 1.6 billion people -- more than 1/5 of the worlds population -- live in areas of sustained crises such as drought, famine, conflict and displacement, WHO said. More than a million Syrians fleeing a gruesome civil war have sought refuge in Lebanon, only to find themselves in peril again. Devastating floods and frigid temperatures have brought more misery and death to refugees living in makeshift camps. An 8-year-old Syrian refugee recently died during a storm after the girl fell into a river and drowned. High-threat pathogens like Ebola Just when we thought Ebola was mostly under control, two separate Ebola outbreaks ravaged parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo last year. Both outbreaks spread to cities of more than 1 million people, the UN health agency said. ""This shows that the context in which an epidemic of a high-threat pathogen like Ebola erupts is critical -- what happened in rural outbreaks in the past doesnt always apply to densely populated urban areas or conflict-affected areas,"" WHO said. In addition to Ebola, scientists are prioritizing on several other hemorrhagic fevers, Zika, Nipah, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), WHO said . Non-transmissible diseases While there are plenty of fears about contagious diseases, more than 70% of all deaths worldwide are from non-transmissible diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. ""This includes 15 million people dying prematurely, aged between 30 and 69,"" WHO said. ""The rise of these diseases has been driven by five major risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and air pollution."" Dengue Something as simple as a mosquito bite can turn deadly in cases of dengue, which ""has been a growing threat for decades,"" WHO said. ""An estimated 40% of the world is at risk of dengue fever, and there are around 390 million infections a year,"" WHO said. Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and can kill up to 20% of those with severe cases, the agency said. ""A high number of cases occur in the rainy seasons of countries such as Bangladesh and India. Now, its season in these countries is lengthening significantly ... and the disease is spreading to less tropical and more temperate countries."" Weak primary health care While those with good insurance often take health care for granted, the lack of adequate primary care is rampant in many parts of the world ""Primary health care can meet the majority of a persons health needs of the course of their life,"" WHO said. ""Yet many countries do not have adequate primary health care facilities."" HIV The good news: Weve made a lot of progress in terms of HIV testing and treatment. About 22 million people are currently getting treated for HIV, WHO said, and others who are at risk of getting HIV are taking antiretroviral medications to prevent getting infected. ""However, the epidemic continues to rage with nearly a million people every year dying of HIV/AIDS,"" WHO said. About 37 million people around the world are living with HIV, the agency said. ""A group increasingly affected by HIV are young girls and women (aged 15--24), who are particularly at high risk and account for 1 in 4 HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa despite being only 10% of the population,"" WHO said. The agency said this year it will work with countries to promote self-testing so people who have HIV can learn their status and get treatment. WHO and the International Labour Organization will also support companies and organizations to offer HIV self-tests in workplaces.CNN.

Infertility is a global health issue, affecting approximately 8-10% of couple worldwide. It was estimated that the rates of infertility in South Asia, as 4% in Bangladesh, 6% in Nepal, 5% in Pakis tan and 4% in Sri Lanka. Though the cause of infertility depends upon either husband or wife or both, sometimes wife alone is blamed in our society. In infertile couple, the causative factor lies in the female in about 40% of cases and in 35% cause lies in male. About 10 to 20% of cases both husband and wife are responsible for infertility and rests are unexplained. But at present the research and development in medical science has been facilitated the Infertility’s treatment by adding a very sophisticated method ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) like IVF (In Vitro Fertilization), ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection), IUI (Intrauterine Insemination). But sometimes these methods could not work properly and fails due to disharmony of body’s internal environment, vital energy or in homeostasis balance which manifested in different problems in the follicles, ovary, eggs, uterus or sperm, and as an anxiety, depression etc. So, these troubles most of time lead to male and female infertility. However, these problems are treated well in the China, Japan, Korea since long and now almost all of the western countries with the integration of Acupuncture treatment. Sometime Acupuncture treatment itself also, helps the body to conceive normally without any extra procedures. Acupuncture treatment involves tiny, disposable, sterile needles placed gently into specific points on the body to relieve dysfunction, maintain disharmony and restore health. It is an effective method of treatment. It has worked where nothing else has. The effectiveness of acupuncture is well-documented. Throughout its long history, acupuncture has established a solid reputation as an excellent alternative for health care that actually works. This traditional method of treatment is recognized and recommended by WHO and National Institutes of Health-USA as a traditional medicine, which is scientific, drug less, free from side effect, complimentary, simple and very effective method for various diseases. An Acupuncture doctor should possess adequate knowledge and experience for providing proper treatment to his/her patients. Inadequate education, knowledge and experience may lead to serious medical problems. This method of treatment is also exists in Dhaka at govt. hospital, only at “Govt, Unani-Ayurvedic Medical College & Hospital, Mirpur-13 at free of cost. This is an affiliated and constituent institute under the University of Dhaka. Here overseas educated acupuncture specialist is providing free treatment service. Every person and couple having difficulty conceiving need individualized treatment because no two persons present with the exact same issues. With that customized approach, acupuncture treatment can be an effective means to aid conception in many cases of infertility like endometriosis, ovulation problems, male factor, poor ovarian reserve, poor egg quality, chronic miscarriage, irregular periods etc. At present in most of the countries for the best results, most couples are achieving a greater success by trying acupuncture treatment. Couples often feel the need to do as much as medically possible as soon as possible, often due to a sense of running out of time from aging. However, the majority of couples respond to acupuncture treatment, often resulting in an easier pregnancy and healthier baby. Acupuncture can improve egg and sperm quality and some of other reproductive problems which will dramatically improve chance of a natural pregnancy or increase success rate with IVF by improving the quality of the embryo and decreasing the chances of a miscarriage. How acupuncture treatment helps of infertility: Acupuncture method of treatment creates internal order & equilibrium of health. Specific acupuncture treatment for infertility helps in restoration of natural fertility by: I. Improves natural conception abilities and chances. II. Fights conditions which causes infertility and its impact on body. III. Improves and balances vital energy. IV. Correc ts Qi and blood deficiency and stagnation. V. Removes excess cold & phlegm from uterus. VI. Improves all physiological body functions. VII. Corrects hormonal imbalance. VIII. Corrects immunological system and antibodies thereby fights endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory diseases etc. IX. Improves psychological status. X. Improves reproductive organs and their functioning. XI. Improves ovulation with healthier eggs. XII. Improves uterus lining and conditions for implantation of fertilized egg and its stay in uterus. XIII. Improves semen and sperm count and quality in males. XIV. Improves blood flow and nutrition to uterus, ovaries, testis. XV. Improves uterus and ovary morphology.

Scientific research on acupuncture treatment for infertility: Acupuncture is best for those people who have already undergone various treatments without any effective results or numerous physical problems are not allowing him to follow ART/IVF etc. There has been significant research which has found that acupuncture treatment have a positive effect on those trying for a baby and can actually aid the conception process. Fertility focused acupuncture treatment has been found to help increase blood flow to the reproductive organs, balance hormone levels, regulate the menstrual cycle and help improve the lining of the uterus and quality of eggs and sperm released. Additionally, conditions such as polycystic ovaries and endometriosis have also been shown to improve with acupuncture. There are several research papers, articles has been published all over the world about the efficacy of Acupuncture treatment. Following are some of the mentionable quotations, cited from those research documents in favour of effec tiveness of Acupuncture treatment. 01. A 2008 study published in the British Medical Journal found that acupuncture given with embryo transfer can improve rates of pregnancy by 65% in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). 02. A 2005 study conducted by Shanghai University in China found that acupuncture also helped treat male infertility. Of the men who participated, those who had acupuncture had an increased percentage of sperm in their semen; their sperm structure and morphology was also healthier than their counterparts who did not undergo acupuncture infertility treatment. Thus, Acupuncture improves sperm count, motility, and morphology. 03. A 2004 study conducted by the Reproductive Medicine and Fertility Center in Colorado, USA found that 51% of women who underwent both IVF and acupuncture treatment at the same time became pregnant, while only 36% of those who only underwent IVF did. The latter group also had higher rates of miscarriage and stillbirth (20%) compared to those women who had received acupuncture (8%). 04. A report published in the journal Fertility and Sterility (2002) found the pregnancy rate in the group receiving acupuncture group was 42.5%, compared to the group which did not receive the therapy, where the rate was 26.3%. 05. A research entitled “Treatment of male sterility by acupuncture” published by Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian, stated that “acupuncture treatment were applied to treat 34 cases of male sterility. Twenty-five cases were cured, among those 22 cases wives had been pregnant, 6 improved, 3 obtained no effect, and the total effective rate was 91. 18%. There was obvious difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment in sperm density, mobility, forward movement rate, movement speed, average linear ratio, average vertical ratio and average swing frequency of sperm head.” 06. There have been several studies showing the benefit of acupuncture treatment with a specific protocol before and after an embryo transfer during an IVF cycle. There are 14 research studies published in the peer reviewed journal Fertility and Sterility. This journal is highly regarded internationally as one of the best sources for Reproductive Endocrinology research studies. These studies have indicated that acupuncture performed before and after IVF embryo transfer has increased the rates of pregnancy by as much as 35-50%. 07. The German study-2002 concluded that acupuncture had a significant influence on IVF success. In a trial of 160 women, receiving acupuncture before and after implantation nearly doubled a woman’s chance of success. The study show that the Acupuncture Treatment group’s IVF success rate was 42.5% whereas, the control group was 26.3%.",{},"['acupuncture', 'art', 'research', 'improving', 'ivf', 'infertility', 'sperm', 'reproductive', 'treatment', 'improves', 'rate', 'success']","Acupuncture treatment involves tiny, disposable, sterile needles placed gently into specific points on the body to relieve dysfunction, maintain disharmony and restore health.

Syphilis is an STD that can have very serious…",,2018-01-05,Addressing a serious public health issue in Bangladesh | theindependentbd.com,"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) include more than 35 infectious organisms that are transmitted primarily through sexual activity. STDs can lead to harmful medical conditions, including poor reproductive outcomes and increased risk of HIV infection. Syphilis is an STD that can have very serious complications when left untreated, but it’s easy to prevent and can be cured with the right treatment. Syphilis remains a significant public health problem in Bangladesh. Syphilis rates are increasing among women and men throughout Bangladesh. Untreated syphilis can cause severe medical issues. Efforts are needed to create new tools to detect and treat syphilis, increase testing, control the further spread of syphilis, and improve electronic medical records in order to improve patient outcomes. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that can have very serious complications when left untreated, but it is simple to prevent and can be cured with the right treatment. Penicillin has been used to treat syphilis since 1943 and remains the best drug for treating the infection. When not adequately treated, syphilis can lead to visual impairment, hearing loss, stroke, and other neurological problems. Syphilis infection can also increase a person’s risk for getting HIV or giving it to others. All syphilis cases are to be reported to the public health agency so that it can take action to find and treat exposed persons. This prevents others from becoming infected and also prevents the adverse health outcomes of untreated syphilis. Recent data show that syphilis rates are on the rise. Rates of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis—the most infectious stages of the disease—increased while rates have increased among both men and women; and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Likewise, increases in congenital syphilis (CS) have paralleled the national increase in P&S syphilis among women of reproductive age. CS, which can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, early infant death, or severe illness in those infants who survive, increased each year. A pregnant woman with untreated syphilis can infect her fetus through the bloodstream during any stage of syphilis. Bangladesh needs new tools for syphilis prevention and control to supplement those in use since the 1940s. Fortunately, penicillin still works to treat syphilis. However, it is the only known antibiotic to treat syphilis during pregnancy. So for pregnant women with a severe allergy to penicillin, or when there is a drug shortage, there are no alternative treatment regimens to turn. The rest of our treatment and prevention tools are outdated. The most commonly used tests do not confirm syphilis on the spot. Instead, they require at least two sequential antibody tests in blood, rather than directly detecting the presence of syphilis-causing bacteria. These tests are cumbersome and may lead to treatment delays. Results can be hard to interpret. Existing tests cannot diagnose an early infection. There is a critical need for modernized test development. For example, if we could look at the proteins or at genetics-based technologies, test results would be fast and specific. Treatment options need to be expanded, especially for pregnant women, congenital syphilis, ocular syphilis, and neurosyphilis. Research is also needed to better identify the stage of disease and determine appropriate management of syphilis, factors associated with the development of neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis, and treatment for syphilis disease in individuals living with HIV. There is no syphilis vaccine, despite early work demonstrating that vaccination could potentially protect from syphilis disease. Additionally, very few biomedical scientists have entered the field, and in the 21st century many clinicians are not familiar with the appropriate diagnosis and management of syphilis. A pregnant woman with untreated syphilis can infect her fetus through the bloodstream at any stage of syphilis. Up to 40 percent of babies born to women with untreated syphilis may be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn. Infants born with congenital syphilis might have health problems, including skin rashes, yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice), enlarged liver and spleen, or severe anemia. Untreated babies that survive the newborn period can develop problems later on, such as developmental delays and bone and joint abnormalities. The resurgence of congenital syphilis points to missed opportunities for prevention. One quarter of congenital syphilis cases are due to a lack of prenatal care. But even among those receiving some prenatal care, the detection and treatment of maternal syphilis often occur too late to prevent congenital syphilis of women who gave birth to an infant with congenital syphilis were not tested in time to be treated to prevent congenital syphilis. Syphilis screening needs to increase among men who have sex with men (MSM). The current situation is stark— reported syphilis among MSM increasing day by day. Addressing syphilis among men is challenging. Syphilis epidemics vary by geography, race/ethnicity, age, and HIV serostatus Syphilis prevention has historically relied on partner notification to interrupt disease transmission, which has been difficult to scale up to levels that would reduce new infections at an MSM population level. Dramatic improvements in access to and effectiveness of HIV treatment have resulted in changes in sexual behaviour and social norms that may reduce the risk of HIV but have little impact on syphilis risk reduction, such as treatment as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), seroadaptive behaviours, and reduced reliance on condoms. To reduce the numbers of women and their babies who are infected with syphilis, the government should work to improve congenital syphilis data through an enhanced congenital syphilis surveillance system to capture stillbirths, infant morbidity, and cases prevented; investigate all congenital syphilis cases in states to identify missed opportunities and improve services; develop tools and evaluate high-impact prevention services, such as syphilis screening; timely treatment; partner services; and linkage to contraceptive counseling, behavioural health, and pregnancy case management programmes; develop congenital syphilis prevention guidelines for health care providers and health departments; identify and share best practices, such as infant morbidity review boards, assessment approaches to identify missed opportunities, and implementation of system level changes; and support health care providers to implement recommended syphilis screening and treatment of pregnant women and women of reproductive age through training, guidelines, tools, and resources. To reverse this increasing trend of syphilis among MSM, the government also should work to harmonize STD/HIV screening recommendations and prevention messages related to sexual health services for MSM; support health care providers to implement recommended STD screening, treatment, and through training, guidelines, tools, and resources; improve syphilis surveillance among homosexual, bisexual, and other MSM; conduct epidemiologic studies to better understand factors associated with syphilis adverse outcomes, such as neurosyphilis and ocular syphilis, and transmission networks; and identify and share best practices. Syphilis is treatable, but the medicine used to treat the disease has been in use for 75 years. There is no rapid test for syphilis, so individuals must undergo a blood test and wait days for the results.

The importance of women's health,,,,,"The importance of womens health Womens health issues have attained higher international visibility and renewed political commitment in recent decades. While targeted policies and programs have enabled women to lead healthier lives, significant gender-based health disparities remain in many countries. With limited access to education or employment, high illiteracy rates and increasing poverty levels are making health improvements for women exceedingly difficult. “A womans health is her total well-being, not determined solely by biological factors and reproduction, but also by effects of work load, nutrition, stress, war and migration, among others” (van der Kwaak, 1991). Health-related challenges continue. Many of the modest gains in womens health realized in recent decades are now threatened or have been reversed due to war, economic instability and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Basic health care, family planning and obstetric services are essential for women – yet they remain unavailable to millions. Gender-equitable approaches to health are needed to enable womens full participation in the planning and delivery of health services. The health of families and communities are tied to the health of women – the illness or death of a woman has serious and far-reaching consequences for the health of her children, family and community. The slogan, “Healthy Women, Healthy World” embodies the fact that as custodians of family health, women play a critical role in maintaining the health and well being of their communities. Maternal conditions are leading causes of death and disability among women. More than 99 percent of the estimated 536,000 maternal deaths each year occur in the developing world. Every year, about 10 million women endure life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth, sometimes leading to long term disability. Globally, women comprise half of the adults living with HIV/AIDS – in sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion rises to 61 percent. A woman affected by HIV/AIDS is plunged further into poverty, losing the ability to provide for herself and her children. Early and unwanted childbearing, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy-related illnesses and deaths account for a significant proportion of the burden of illness experienced by women – especially in low-income countries. Nearly all maternal deaths are preventable through timely prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance during delivery and the availability of emergency care to deal with complications. The health benefits of spacing and limiting births for mothers and children with family planning services are well known. Millennium Development Goal 5 focuses on reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by 75 percent between 1990 and 2015 and ensuring universal access to reproductive health by 2015. International funding from public and private donors and other non-governmental organizations accounts for only 15 percent of the expenditures on reproductive health and family planning activities in developing countries. The majority of spending comes from within the countries themselves, with more than half coming from consumers pockets.

Nearly half of its 160 million population live below the poverty line. Bangladesh features the third highest number of poor people living in a single country after India and China. These challenges are magnified by a population density of roughly 800 people per square kilometre—one of the highest in the world. Such poverty fuels many high-risk behaviour patterns, including commercial sex work. This is obviously a risk factor for the spread of HIV. While, as an Islamic country, Bangladesh proscribes the consumption of alcohol, there is significant abuse of this substance. Porous borders with India and Myanmar permit trafficking in drugs and other contraband. Drug Situation Production and cultivation Cannabis is still cultivated, particularly in the districts of Naogaon, Rajshahi, Jamalpur and Netrokona in the northwestern region, as well as the hilly districts near Cox’s Bazaar, Banderban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati in the southeast (bordering Myanmar). Reliable figures for the total area of cannabis production in Bangladesh are not available, but cultivation in the Chittagong Hill Tract region is reportedly on the increase. The army and the Border Guard Bangladesh in the southeastern hilly region have reported that the overall cannabis production has increased significantly in recent years. Manufacture Bangladesh is not believed to manufacture any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances illicitly. It also does not manufacture any precursor chemicals except hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid. Trafficking Bangladesh is a transit country for drugs produced in the Golden Triangle and, to a much lesser degree, Key Facts Consumption of both opium and cannabis are traditional in Bangladesh. Other drugs such as heroin began to be smuggled into the country only in the 1980s. The smuggling, diversion and abuse of pharmaceuticals originating from India is considered the single largest drug problem in Bangladesh. Commonly abused pharmaceuticals are Phensidyl® (a codeine-based cough syrup), Tidigesic® (buprenorphine) and pethidine injections. There are approximately 20,000 -25,000 IDUs in the country. The most commonly injected drug is buprenorphine (commonly known by the trade name1 Tidigesic®). Poly drug use is common. Bangladesh is considered a “low prevalence, high risk situation” for HIV/AIDS. However, recent trends indicate that in certain areas the HIV/AIDS prevalence among IDUs may be approaching the concentrated epidemic mark (5%). According to research, certain outreach interventions have been effective in reducing the size of the sharing group (of needles and syringes) among IDUs. In areas where such interventions occurred, 25% of IDUs shared with three persons or more against a much higher 40% in areas where no outreach programme existed. In contrast to 87% of the current IDUs from intervention sites, only 66% of IDUs in districts without outreach interventions knew that syringe and needles sharing could spread HIV. Recently, a new heroin trafficking route has opened up from the north central states of India eastwards into Bangladesh. A portion of this product is consumed in Bangladesh while some is destined for overseas. Bangladesh is a source country for women and children being trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation, involuntary domestic servitude and debt bondage. The estimated number of women and girls trafficked annually out of the country is 10,000 – 20,000. Some reports indicate that 40,000 children from Bangladesh are involved in prostitution in Pakistan. There is also significant internal movement within the country to urban centres for the same purposes. the Golden Crescent. Reports from the Indian Narcotics Control Bureau also indicate that heroin is smuggled from India to Bangladesh through the porous Indo-Bangladesh border. Nonetheless, the smuggling in, diversion and abuse of pharmaceuticals originating from India is considered to be the largest drug problem in Bangladesh. Commonly abused pharmaceuticals are Phensidyl® (a codeine-based cough syrup), Tidigesic® (buprenorphine) and pethidine injections. Demand Bangladesh has clearly moved from being a transit country to one where so-called ‘hard’ drugs are used. The number of drug users is increasing in both urban and rural areas. The number of injecting drug users (IDUs) is also on the rise, with the majority using buprenorphine. The drug most frequently used by drug-dependent persons reporting to treatment centres is heroin. Phensidyl®, a codeine-based cough syrup imported from India, is generally considered to be the most widely abused drug. There are approximately 20,000 25,000 IDUs in the country (Reid and Costigan 2002). The most commonly injected drug is buprenorphine (commonly known by the trade name Tidigesic®). Polydrug use is common and may include marijuana, Tidigesic®, Phensidyl®, alcohol, codeine, nitrazepam, ‘brown sugar’ (heroin ‘cooked’ with vitamin C) and diazepam. A survey included a collection of both secondary as well as primary data, which comprised of observations, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and interviews with drug users. In most districts both heroin smokers and drug injectors were found. Ten percent of all drug users who reported ever having smoked heroin started doing so at the age of 17 or earlier. Three percent of all injectors started injecting before the age of 18 years. The mean age of onset for heroin smoking was 24 years, while the mean age of onset for IDU was 28 years. The dynamics of switching to injecting from heroin smoking were also studied and the finding that 87% of current IDUs had once been heroin smokers and many drug users went back and forth from one type of drug use to another, suggests that the drug use pattern keeps changing. More than 25% of IDUs in districts with outreach interventions, 99% of IDUs in districts without outreach interventions and 99% of all heroin smokers in all districts were not in contact with any outreach programme. The study also reported that a spillover of illicit drugs occurs around the drug trafficking network. Trafficking and drug Bangladesh possesses laws to prevent trafficking. Some social services are provided for trafficking victims. In early 2004, the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs attempted to raise awareness on the issue of human trafficking. In 2003, it established ‘one-stop’ crisis centres in two hospitals for female victims of violence and human trafficking. Legislation The Narcotics Control Act of 1990 (Act Number XX of 1990) covers the control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug dependent people. Bangladesh has amended the narcotics act and allows the Director General of the Department of Narcotics Control to send drug addicts for treatment. Drug use is considered a treatable condition rather than a criminal offence. Policy – Crime The constitution of Bangladesh provides “to enjoy the protection of the law and to be treated in accordance with law, is an undeniable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being in Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law”. The constitution further provides that “every person accused of a criminal offence shall have the right to a speedy and public trial by an independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law”.

The health of women and girls is of particular concern because, in many societies, they are disadvantaged by discrimination rooted in sociocultural factors. For example, women and girls face increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Some of the sociocultural factors that prevent women and girls to benefit from quality health services and attaining the best possible level of health include: unequal power relationships between men and women; social norms that decrease education and paid employment opportunities; an exclusive focus on women’s reproductive roles; and potential or actual experience of physical, sexual and emotional violence. While poverty is an important barrier to positive health outcomes for both men and women, poverty tends to yield a higher burden on women and girls’ health due to, for example, feeding practices (malnutrition) and use of unsafe cooking fuels (COPD). Key facts Worldwide, women live an average four years longer than men. In 2011, womens life expectancy at birth was more than 80 years in 46 countries, but only 58 years in the WHO African Region. Girls are far more likely than boys to suffer sexual abuse. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Almost all (99%) of the approximate 287 000 maternal deaths every year occur in developing countries. Globally, cardiovascular disease, often thought to be a ""male"" problem, is the number one killer of women. Breast cancer is the leading cancer killer among women aged 20–59 years worldwide. Infancy and childhood (0-9 years) Both death rates and the causes of death are similar for boys and girls during infancy and childhood. Prematurity, birth asphyxia and infections are the main causes of death during the first month of life, which is the time of life when the risk of death is the highest. Pneumonia, prematurity, birth asphyxia and diarrhoea are the main causes of death during the first five years of life. Malnutrition is a major contributing factor in 45% of deaths in children aged less than 5 years. Adolescent girls (10-19 years) Mental health and injuries Self-inflicted injuries, road traffic injuries and drowning are among the main causes of death worldwide in adolescent girls. Depressive disorders and – in adolescents aged 15-19 years, schizophrenia – are leading causes of ill health. HIV/AIDS In 2011, about 820 000 women and men aged 15-24 were newly infected with HIV in low- and middle-income countries; more than 60% of them were women. Globally, adolescent girls and young women (15-24 years) are twice as likely to be at risk of HIV infection compared to boys and young men in the same age group. This higher risk of HIV is associated with unsafe and often unwanted and forced sexual activity. Adolescent pregnancy Early childbearing increases risks for both mothers and their newborns. Although progress has been made in reducing the birth rate among adolescents, more than 15 million of the 135 million live births worldwide are among girls aged 15-19 years. Pregnant adolescents are more likely than adults to have unsafe abortions. An estimated three million unsafe abortions occur globally every year among girls aged 15-19 years. Unsafe abortions contribute substantially to lasting health problems and maternal deaths. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are an important cause of death among girls aged 15–19 in low- and middle-income countries. Substance use An estimated three million unsafe abortions occur globally every year among girls aged 15-19 years. Unsafe abortions contribute substantially to lasting health problems and maternal deaths. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are an important cause of death among girls aged 15–19 in low- and middle-income countries. Adolescent girls are increasingly using tobacco and alcohol, which risks compromising their health, particularly in later life. In some places girls are using tobacco and alcohol nearly as much as boys. For example, in the WHO Region of the Americas, 23% of boys and 21% of girls aged 13-15 reported that they used tobacco in the previous month. Nutrition In 21 out of 41 countries with data, more than one third of girls aged 15-19 years are anaemic. Anaemia, most commonly iron-deficiency anaemia, increases the risk of haemorrhage and sepsis during childbirth. It causes cognitive and physical deficits in young children and reduces productivity in adults. Women and girls are most vulnerable to anaemia due to insufficient iron in their diets, menstrual blood loss and periods of rapid growth. Reproductive age (15-44 years) and adult women (20-59 years) HIV/AIDS For women aged 15-44 years, HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death worldwide, with unsafe sex being the main risk factor in developing countries. Biological factors, lack of access to information and health services, economic vulnerability and unequal power in sexual relations expose women, particularly young women, to HIV infection. Maternal health Maternal deaths are the second biggest killer of women of reproductive age. Every year, approximately 287 000 women die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, 99% of them are in developing countries. Despite the increase in contraceptive use over the past 30 years, many women in all regions still do not have access to modern contraceptive methods. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, one in four women who wish to delay or stop childbearing does not use any family planning method. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is often linked to HIV infection and is among the five leading causes of death, in low-income countries, among women of reproductive age and among adult women aged 20–59 years. Injuries Both self-inflicted injuries and road injuries figure among the top 10 causes of death among adult women (20-59 years) globally. In the WHO South-East Asia Region, burns are among the top 10 leading causes of death among women aged 15–44. Women suffer significantly more fire-related injuries and deaths than men, due to cooking accidents or as the result of intimate partner and family violence. Cervical cancer Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide, with all cases linked to a sexually transmitted genital infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Due to poor access to screening and treatment services, more than 90% of deaths occur in women living in low- and middle- income countries. Violence Violence against women is widespread around the world. Recent figures indicate that 35% of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. On average, 30% of women who have been in a relationship experienced some form of physical or sexual violence by their partner. Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner. Women who have been physically or sexually abused have higher rates of mental ill-health, unintended pregnancies, abortions and miscarriages than non-abused women. Women exposed to partner violence are twice as likely to be depressed, almost twice as likely to have alcohol use disorders, and 1.5 times more likely to have HIV or another sexually transmitted infection. 42% of them have experienced injuries as a result. Increasingly in many conflicts, sexual violence is also used as a tactic of war. Depression and suicide Women are more susceptible to depression and anxiety than men. Depression is the leading cause of disease burden for women in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. Depression following childbirth, affects 20% of mothers in low- and lower-middle-income countries, which is even higher than previous reports from high-income countries. Every year, an estimated 800 000 people die from suicide globally, the majority being men. However, there are exceptions, for instance in China where the suicide rate in rural areas is higher among women than men. Attempted suicide, which exceeds suicide by up to 20 times, is generally more frequent among women than men and causes an unrecognized burden of disability. At the same time, attempted suicide is an important risk factor for death from suicide and shows the need for appropriate health services for this group. Disabilities Disability – which affects 15% of the world’s population – is more common among women than men. Women with disabilities have poorer health outcomes, lower education achievements, less economic participation and higher rates of poverty than women without disabilities. Adult women with disabilities are at least 1.5 times more likely to be a victim of violence than those without a disability. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Tobacco use and the burning of solid fuels for cooking are the primary risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – a life-threatening lung disease – in women. One third of all of the COPD deaths and disease burden in women is caused by exposure to indoor smoke from cooking with open fires or inefficient stoves. Older women (60 years and over) Globally, men slightly outnumber women but, as women tend to live longer than men, they represent a higher proportion of older adults: 54% of people 60 years of age and older are women, a proportion that rises to almost 60% at age 75 and older, and to 70% at age 90 and older. Noncommunicable diseases Noncommunicable diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and cancers, are the biggest causes of death among older women, regardless of the level of economic development of the country in which they live. Cardiovascular diseases account for 46% of older women’s deaths globally, while a further 14% of deaths are caused by cancers – mainly cancers of the lung, breast, colon and stomach. Chronic respiratory conditions, mainly COPD, cause another 9% of older women’s deaths. Many of the health problems faced by women in older age are the result of exposure to risk factors in adolescence and adulthood, such as smoking, sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy diets. Disability Other health problems experienced by older women that decrease physical and cognitive functioning include poor vision (including cataracts), hearing loss, arthritis, depression and dementia. Although men also suffer from these conditions, in many countries women are less likely to receive treatment or supportive aids than men.

And in 18 African countries a third of todays 15 year olds will become infected with HIV during their adult lives. An unplanned pregnancy is a serious reproductive health risk for many adolescent girls. In addition to disease and possibly death, other severe consequences for an unmarried adolescent with an unplanned pregnancy include expulsion from school, loss of job or dishonour for her family and herself. Because they are afraid, ashamed or desperate; many young women are willing to risk their lives to end an unplanned pregnancy. They seek an illegal abortion, often from an untrained person under unsafe conditions, or they try dangerous ways to induce an abortion. Ashley Montage, a programme associate for the us based Ipas, a reproductive health organisationlthat concentrates on preventing unsafe abortion says: ""Adolescents are more likely than adults to deny they are pregnant"", not, recognise the signs of pregnancy, delay decision making and seek abortion later in the pregnancy, which puts them at greater risks."" Clandestine abortion is associated with high rates of illness and death. Unsafe abortion can result in haemorrhage, infection and cuts or chemical burns. Treatment can require hospitalisation, blood transfusions antibiotics and other drugs. It is interesting to note that beside unintended pregnancies or unmarried pregnancies, of the 15 million young women aged 15 to 19 who give birth every year, 13 million live in less developed countries. Thirty three percent of women in less developed countries give birth before age of 20, ranging from a low of 8 per cent in East Asia to 55 per cent in West Africa. In more developed countries, about 10 per cent of women give birth by age 20; however, in the United States, the level of teen childbearing is significantly higher, at 19 per cent. Early pregnancy and child bearing are typically associated with less education and lower future income for young mothers. For unwed teens in some; countries, motherhood can result is social ostracism. In other settings, teens may choose to become pregnant to gain status with their peers, improve their relationship with family members, or because they have few other life opportunities outside of motherhood. Young women and their children face serious health risks from early pregnancy and child bearing. More adolescent girls die from pregnancy related causes than from any other cause. In fact, maternal morality among 15 to 19 year old women is twice as high as for women in their 20s. Because adolescent women have not completed their growth, in particular height and pelvic size, they are at greater risk of obstructed labour, which can lead to permanent injury or death for both the mother and the infant. Infants of young mothers are also more likely to be premature and have low birth weights. In many countries, the risk of death during the first year of life is 1.5 times higher for infants born to mothers under age 20 than for those born to mothers aged 20 to 29. For all women, first births are higher risk than subsequent births and for teens, the risks are greater still. Because adolescents have less experience resources and knowledge about pregnancy and child-birth than older women, they and their children suffer when obstetric emergencies occur. About youth and the HIV/AIDS crisis it is to be noted that about half of all people infected with HIV are under age 25 according to WHO estimates and in less developed countries, up to 60 per cent of all new infections are among 15 to 24 years olds. In this group of newly infected people, there are twice as many young women as young men. Adolescents are at high risk of contracting HIV and other STIs because, among other reasons, they often have multiple short-term sexual relationships and do nor consistently use condoms. They also tend to lack sufficient information and understanding of HI V/AIDS: their vulnerability to it, how to prevent it and the self-confidence necessary to protect themselves. Young people face special obstacles in obtaining diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), even where services are available. They usually lack information about STIs, their symptoms, the need for treatment and where to obtain services. They are also reluctant to seek care and providers may be hesitant to treat them, because females with eclampsia and gonorrhoea, the most common STIs often do not show symptoms, and because having another STI increases an individuals susceptibility to HIV, young people are at high risk of contracting and spreading these infections. Additionally, young people often believe that STIs will simply go away if untreated or that they will not recur if treated. Young women are particularly vulnerable to STIs for both biological and cultural reasons. Adolescents women have lower protective antibodies than do older women and the immaturity of their services increases their likelihood that exposure to infection will result in the transmission of the disease. Sexual violence and exploitation back of formal education (including sex education), inability to negotiate with partners about sexual decisions, and lack of access to contraception and reproductive health services work together to put young women at respectively high risk. Additionally, women in many societies are not accustomed to discussing issues of reproductive health and sexuality with others, which further increases their vulnerability. Health experts say, ""For developing countries, if adolescents are to avoid unplanned pregnancies, diseases and other serious reproductive health problems, they need accurate information and services. ""Preventing HIV infections among adolescents is an excellent strategy for slowing AIDS pandemic,"" says Dr. Ward Caies, Jr. President of FHI and an expert on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). ""Younger people are more likely to adopt and maintain safe sexual behaviours than are older people with well-established sexual habits, making youth excellent candidates for prevention efforts."" He says, ""Reducing adolescent infections will ultimately result in fewer infections among all age groups. However, many inter-related and complex factor that put adolescents at risk of HIV and other STDs will not be changed easily pr quickly, he and other experts say. In many settings, these include poor education, unemployment and poverty. Also urbanisation can disrupt family relationships, social networks and traditional moves while generating more opportunity for sexual encounters. Effective strategies and programmes to protect the reproductive health of adolescents and young adults are needed in every country, but are urgent for youth in developing countries. ""Young adults need a basic understanding of how their bodies work and the reproductive health concerns they face, as can he provided through family life education,"" says Dr. Nancy Williamson, SeniorAssociate for Frontiers in Reproductive Health - a project of the Population Council.

To help in the implementation of the initiative, different tools and materials were developed, field-tested and provided, including a course for maternity staff, a self-appraisal tool and an external assessment tool. Additional tools were developed afterwards, such as monitoring and reassessment tools. Since its launching BFHI has grown, with more than 152 countries around the world implementing the initiative. The initiative has measurable and proven impact, increasing the likelihood of babies being exclusively breastfed for the first six months. Since 1991, the Global Strategy for IYCF was launched with nine operational targets, including BFHI. New evidence became available in the area of infant and young child feeding. Additionally the HIV pandemic raised concerns and queries in relation to feeding recommendations for children of HIV-infected mothers slowing down the process of implementation of BFHI. In response to the HIV pandemic and other new evidence, WHO and UNICEF collaborated on an effort to update the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative materials and promote the initiative in the context of the Global Strategy for Infant and young child feeding. The updated materials integrate Code implementation, mother-friendliness, care of pregnant women and mothers in the context of HIV, emergencies as well as expansion towards other type of health facilities and the community. The updated process was also used for strengthening the BFHI-related training courses.

While targeted policies and programs have enabled women to lead healthier lives, significant gender-based health disparities remain in many countries. With limited access to education or employment, high illiteracy rates and increasing poverty levels are making health improvements for women exceedingly difficult. “A womans health is her total well-being, not determined solely by biological factors and reproduction, but also by effects of work load, nutrition, stress, war and migration, among others” (van der Kwaak, 1991). Health-related challenges continue. Many of the modest gains in womens health realized in recent decades are now threatened or have been reversed due to war, economic instability and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Basic health care, family planning and obstetric services are essential for women – yet they remain unavailable to millions. Gender-equitable approaches to health are needed to enable womens full participation in the planning and delivery of health services. The health of families and communities are tied to the health of women – the illness or death of a woman has serious and far-reaching consequences for the health of her children, family and community. The slogan, “Healthy Women, Healthy World” embodies the fact that as custodians of family health, women play a critical role in maintaining the health and well being of their communities. Maternal conditions are leading causes of death and disability among women. More than 99 percent of the estimated 536,000 maternal deaths each year occur in the developing world. Every year, about 10 million women endure life-threatening complications during pregnancy and childbirth, sometimes leading to long term disability. Globally, women comprise half of the adults living with HIV/AIDS – in sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion rises to 61 percent. A woman affected by HIV/AIDS is plunged further into poverty, losing the ability to provide for herself and her children. Early and unwanted childbearing, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy-related illnesses and deaths account for a significant proportion of the burden of illness experienced by women – especially in low-income countries. Nearly all maternal deaths are preventable through timely prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance during delivery and the availability of emergency care to deal with complications. The health benefits of spacing and limiting births for mothers and children with family planning services are well known. Millennium Development Goal 5 focuses on reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) by 75 percent between 1990 and 2015 and ensuring universal access to reproductive health by 2015. International funding from public and private donors and other non-governmental organizations accounts for only 15 percent of the expenditures on reproductive health and family planning activities in developing countries. The majority of spending comes from within the countries themselves, with more than half coming from consumers pockets.

FAQs about cervical cancer,,,,,"FAQs about cervical cancer Cervical cancer What is cancer? Cancer is the disease caused by uncontrolled growth of certain cells in the body, causing tumors or growths. Not all growths are cancer. When a cancer is allowed to grow and spread it can interfere with the normal functions of the body. What causes cervical cancer? Cervical cancer is caused by infection with a virus called human papillomavirus or HPV. It is a very common virus that is passed during sexual relations, so most people will have it at some time in their lives. For most people, HPV will go away on its own, but in a small number of infected women the virus will persist. For these women, the virus can cause changes in the cells of the cervix which might develop into cervical cancer if they are not found during a screening test and removed. Does HPV cause any other diseases? HPV can cause genital warts in both men and women. Genital warts are caused by different types of the HPV virus than cervical cancer. Genital warts will not turn into cancer, although they may require treatment if they do not go away on their own. In rare cases, HPV can cause other types of cancers, including cancer of the vagina, vulva, penis or anus. Who gets cervical cancer? Almost all women who have had sexual relations, even without having had sexual intercourse, can be infected with HPV and are therefore at risk of cervical cancer. The women at greatest risk are those who have never been screened. Women who are living with HIV are also at greater risk because HIV makes them more likely to develop cancer when they are younger. The good news is that most women’s bodies will clear the HPV infection on their own and they will never get cancer, but screening is the only way to know who may develop the disease. Because cervical cancer is not commonly found in women until they are in their 40s and 50s, the best time to screen for pre-cancer is between the ages of 30 and 49 years, before it becomes cancer. What can I do to prevent cervical cancer? The most effective ways to prevent cervical cancer are for girls to get vaccinated before they start sexual activity and for women 30–49 years old to get screened. If a woman’s screening test is positive, she needs to be promptly treated. This can save her life. If the test is negative, it’s a good idea to have repeat screenings, according to national guidelines. If you have a daughter, make sure she receives all recommended doses of the HPV vaccine. Also, teach her about the importance of screening and early treatment when she is older. All sexually active people should also practise behaviours that prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (e.g. delaying initiation of sexual activity, using condoms, and having as few sexual partners as possible). Smoking tobacco can increase the risk of cervical cancer in women infected with HPV. About screening (early detection) and treatment What is cervical screening? Cervical screening is the testing of all women at risk for cervical cancer to detect if they have pre-cancer. If pre-cancer is found and not treated it may progress to cancer in 10 or more years. There are several very effective tests that can be used for screening, but depending on where you live and what is available, it is likely only one of them will be used. Who should be screened for cervical cancer? Women between the ages of 30 and 49 years (or according to national guidelines) should have a screening test to detect early changes on the cervix, called pre-cancer. Screening for cervical pre-cancer and cancer should also be done in women and girls who have initiated sexual activity as soon as the woman or girl has tested positive for HIV, regardless of age; these women and girls living with HIV should be re-screened 12 months after treatment for pre-cancer, or within three years after negative screening results have developed cancer, most women with pre-cancer will not have any symptoms. You can have pre-cancer for 10–15 years without feeling anything abnormal before it becomes cancer. When symptoms do occur – such as pain in the pelvic region or a foul odour from the vagina – they often are the result of advanced cervical cancer, which is difficult to treat. To avoid advanced cancer, women must be screened for pre-cancer at least once between the ages of 30 and 49 years and must be treated if there are signs of disease. Treatment of pre-cancer is easy and very effective. What is done during screening? There are different tests that can be used. Your health-care provider will tell you about the test used at the local health-care facility. For most tests, the health-care provider will do a pelvic examination to gently swab the cervix. While the test is not painful, it can be a little uncomfortable to have a speculum in the vagina in order to see the cervix. Your healthcare provider should try to make it as comfortable as possible for you. Some tests give the results right away and others require sending the sample to a lab and waiting for results. What if my test is negative? If your screening test is negative, it means that you do not have any changes that might develop into cervical cancer. It is important to be screened every 5–10 years if possible to make sure any pre-cancer changes are caught early and treated right away. What if my test is positive? In most cases, a positive screening test means you have pre-cancer, a condition that can be easily treated in a clinic setting. In a few women, your health-care provider will want to do further testing to make sure that what you have is pre-cancer and not cancer. For those next steps, he or she may send you to another facility – a health centre or hospital. The provider may also refer you to a hospital for further care if he or she is not sure of the test results, or if he or she cannot provide the required treatment. Note for the provider: Unless you have a definitive diagnosis of cancer made using tissue from the cervix, you should not tell the woman she might have cancer, because often the first impressions may be wrong and you may frighten her unnecessarily. Does a positive screening test mean that I have cancer? Does it mean that I will die from cervical cancer? A positive screening test does NOT mean you have cancer. Most often it means you have something called pre-cancer, or early changes that could become cancer in many years if not treated. Pre-cancer is easy to treat and is curable. Often pre-cancer goes away following only one treatment. Very rarely a woman is found to have signs of cervical cancer at the time of screening. If signs of possible cancer are found, your health-care provider will do further testing or will refer you to another health centre or hospital for testing and/or treatment. It is important to treat both pre-cancer and cancer. A diagnosis of cancer does not mean you will die from it; if found early, it can be cured with available treatments. How do we treat pre-cancer? If you have a pre-cancer, your health-care provider might be able to treat it on the same day as the screening. The most common treatment for pre-cancer is to freeze it, a treatment called cryotherapy. Cryotherapy is not painful, although like a pelvic examination it can be uncomfortable. It is very effective and safe. In most cases, your cervix will be healthy and normal after cryotherapy. Another treatment is loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), although it is often not available on the same day. Are screening tests painful? Is part of a woman’s cervix or womb removed during screening? Screening tests are painless, though you may feel a little uncomfortable during a pelvic examination. No part of the cervix or womb is removed during screening. Is one screening enough? Having at least one screening between the ages of 30 and 49 years is good. Just one screening has been shown to decrease a woman’s chance of dying from cervical cancer. However, if you have an option to be screened again, it is a best to be tested again every 5–10 years. I am too shy to show my private parts to a male doctor, what can I do? It may be possible to find a female doctor or nurse who can provide pre-cancer screening. But if that is not possible, ask for a female health-care provider or a friend or family member to be in the room during the screening. Even if you feel shy or embarrassed, please remember that the male and female providers are all trained in the same way and that their goal is to help you prevent cervical cancer. Do the right thing for yourself and for your family – get screened for pre-cancer and treated if you have it. Screening and treatment are not painful. If you do not get screened only because you are shy and the provider is a man, try to overcome this fear and remember that women with cervical cancer suffer much pain and can die from it. How similar is HPV to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS? The two viruses – HPV (human papilloma virus) and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) – are very different. HPV is a much more common infection than HIV – almost everyone who is sexually active becomes infected with HPV at some point in his or her life. HPV lives on the skin and is transmitted when skin touches skin. HIV lives in body fluids like semen and blood, and is transmitted when those body fluids are exchanged between people; this is the reason that condoms are very effective at preventing HIV when sexual intercourse takes place. However, condoms are not as good at preventing HPV infections because this virus can live on the skin. The best way to prevent HPV infection is through vaccination. Currently, no vaccine for HIV exists. Common worries about cervical cancer I have heard that cervical cancer is caused by poor female hygiene or by using sanitary pads more than once. Is that true? No. Cervical cancer is caused by infection with HPV. The cancer has nothing to do with vaginal hygiene or sanitary pads. Is cervical cancer a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? No. However, it is caused by HPV, which can be passed from one person to another during sexual relations. HPV is quite common in both men and women. Only a few women with HPV will get pre-cancer. If not treated, some of these women will develop cervical cancer many years after they were infected with HPV. Are women with many sexual partners at higher risk of HPV infection? Yes. People with many sexual partners are at higher risk of all sexually transmitted infections. The fewer sexual partners a person has, the less chance he or she has of becoming infected with any STI, including the many types of HPV, some of which cause cervical cancer.

Although Genvoya has efficacy comparable to Stribild (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or E/C/F/TDF), the tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) combination demonstrated an improved safety profile compared to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) combination in clinical trials. Important information Genvoya can cause serious side effects, including: Build-up of lactic acid in your blood (lactic acidosis). Lactic acidosis may happen in some people who take Genvoya. Lactic acidosis is a serious medical emergency that can lead to death. Lactic acidosis can be hard to identify early, because the symptoms could seem like symptoms of other health problems. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms which could be signs of lactic acidosis: feel very weak or tired have unusual (not normal) muscle pain have trouble breathing have stomach pain with nausea vomiting feel cold, especially in your arms and legs feel dizzy or lightheaded have a fast or irregular heartbeat Severe liver problems. Severe liver problems may happen in people who take Genvoya. In some cases, these liver problems can lead to death. Your liver may become large (hepatomegaly) and you may develop fat in your liver (steatosis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms of liver problems: your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice) dark ""tea-colored"" urine light-colored bowel movements (stools) loss of appetite for several days or longer nausea stomach pain You may be more likely to get lactic acidosis or severe liver problems if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking Genvoya for a long time. Worsening of Hepatitis B infection. Genvoya is not for use to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. If you have hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and take Genvoya, your HBV may get worse (flareup) if you stop taking Genvoya. A “flare-up” is when your HBV infection suddenly returns in a worse way than before. Do not run out of this medicine. Refill your prescription or talk to your healthcare provider before your Genvoya is all gone. Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. If you stop taking Genvoya, your healthcare provider will need to check your health often and do blood tests regularly for several months to check your HBV infection. Tell your healthcare provider about any new or unusual symptoms you may have after you stop treatment. Genvoya is a prescription medicine that is used without other antiretroviral medicines to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) in people 12 years of age and older: who have not received anti-HIV-1 medicines in the past, or to replace their current anti-HIV-1 medicines: in people who have been on the same anti-HIV-1 medicine regimen for at least 6 months, and who have an amount of HIV-1 in their blood (this is called viral load) that is less than 50 copies/mL, and have never failed past HIV-1 treatment. HIV-1 is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Genvoya contains the prescription medicines elvitegravir (Vitekta), cobicistat (Tybost), emtricitabine (Emtriva) and tenofovir alafenamide. It is not known if Genvoya is safe and effective in children under 12 years of age. When used to treat HIV-1 infection, Genvoya may: Reduce the amount of HIV-1 in your blood. This is called ""viral load"". Increase the number of CD4+ (T) cells in your blood that help fight off other infections. Reducing the amount of HIV-1 and increasing the CD4+ (T) cells in your blood may help improve your immune system. This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak (opportunistic infections). Genvoya does not cure HIV-1 infections or AIDS. You must stay on continuous HIV-1 therapy to control HIV-1 infection and decrease HIV-related illnesses. Avoid doing things that can spread HIV-1 infection to others. Do not share or re-use needles or other injection equipment. Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades. Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions about how to prevent passing HIV-1 to other people. Do not take Genvoya if you also take a medicine that contains: alfuzosin hydrochloride (Uroxatral) carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, Tegretol-XR, Teril) cisapride (Propulsid, Propulsid Quicksolv) ergot-containing medicines, including: dihydroergotamine mesylate (D.H.E. 45, Migranal) ergotamine tartrate (Cafergot, Migergot, Ergostat, Medihaler Ergotamine, Wigraine, Wigrettes) methylergonovine maleate (Ergotrate, Methergine) lovastatin (Advicor, Altoprev, Mevacor) midazolam, when taken by mouth phenobarbital (Luminal) phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek) pimozide (Orap) rifampin (Rifadin, Rifamate, Rifater, Rimactane) sildenafil (Revatio), when used for treating the lung problem, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) simvastatin (Simcor, Vytorin, Zocor) triazolam (Halcion) St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or a product that contains St. John’s wort Before taking Genvoya, tell your healthcare provider if you: have liver problems, including hepatitis B infection have kidney problems have bone problems have any other medical conditions are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Genvoya can harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant during treatment. Pregnancy registry: There is a pregnancy registry for women who take antiviral medicines during pregnancy. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about how you can take part in this registry. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Do not breastfeed if you take Genvoya. You should not breastfeed if you have HIV-1 because of the risk of passing HIV-1 to your baby. At least one of the medicines in Genvoya can pass to your baby in your breast milk. It is not known if the other medicines in Genvoya can pass into your breast milk. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may interact with Genvoya. Keep a list of your medicines and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with Genvoya. Do not start a new medicine without telling your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can tell you if it is safe to take Genvoya with other medicines. Genvoya side effects Genvoya may cause serious side effects, including: Changes in body fat can happen in people who take HIV-1 medicine. These changes may include increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck (“buffalo hump”), breast, and around the middle of your body (trunk). Loss of fat from the legs, arms and face may also happen. The exact cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known. Changes in your immune system (Immune Reconstitution Syndrome) can happen when you start taking HIV-1 medicines. Your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV-1 medicine. New or worse kidney problems, including kidney failure. Your healthcare provider should do blood and urine tests to check your kidneys before you start, and during treatment. Your healthcare provider may tell you to stop treatment if you develop new or worse kidney problems. Bone problems. May include bone pain, softening or thinning (which may lead to fractures). Your healthcare provider may need to do tests to check your bones. The most common side effect is nausea. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

Credit: Jiang Zhu/Scripps Research A new candidate HIV vaccine from Scripps Research surmounts technical hurdles that stymied previous vaccine efforts, and stimulates a powerful anti-HIV antibody response in animal tests. The new vaccine strategy, described in a paper on November 23 in Science Advances, is based on the HIV envelope protein, Env. This complex, shape-shifting molecule has been notoriously difficult to produce in vaccines in a way that induces useful immunity to HIV. However, the Scripps Research scientists found a simple, elegant method for stabilizing Env proteins in the desired shape even for diverse strains of HIV. Mounted on virus-like particles to mimic a whole virus, the stabilized Env proteins elicited robust anti-HIV antibody responses in mice and rabbits. Candidate vaccines based on this strategy are now being tested in monkeys. ""We see this new approach as a general solution to the long-standing problems of HIV vaccine design,"" says principal investigator Jiang Zhu, associate professor in the Department of Integrative Structural and Computation Biology at Scripps Research. Copies of Env study the surface of HIV; their chief function is to grab hold of host cells and break into them to initiate infection. Since Env plays this crucial role in infection, and is the viral structure with the most exposure to the immune system of an infected host, it has been the main target of HIV vaccine efforts. The idea has been to inoculate people with the whole Env protein or subunits of it to stimulate the production of Env-binding antibodies, in the hope that these antibodies will prevent HIV from infecting host cells in future exposures to the virus. So far, of course, no HIV vaccine has been effective in large-scale clinical trials. Many researchers believe that an HIV vaccine can work if it presents Env proteins to the immune system in a way that closely resembles the shape of Env on a real virus before it has infected a cell. But presenting Env correctly has been a huge challenge. On an HIV virus, Env protrudes from the viral membrane in tight clusters of three, called trimers, and these complex structures adopt radically different shapes before and after infecting cells. HIV vaccine researchers, despite years and tens of millions of dollars of experimentation, have failed to find a broadly applicable method for stabilizing Env trimers in the desired, pre-infection shape. ""The trimer-stabilization solutions that have been reported so far have worked for a few HIV strains but have not been generalizable,"" Zhu says. ""Env trimer metastability, as we call it, has really been a central problem for trimer-based HIV vaccine design."" Zhu, trained as a biophysicist, sought a more general solution to the Env stability problem, and in a paper in 2016 he and his Scripps Research colleagues reported that modifying a short, springy section of Env called HR1 might do the trick—it allowed Env to stay in the pre-infection, ""closed"" shape. In the new study he and his team showed that this strategy does indeed work for Env trimers from diverse HIV strains circulating in different parts of the world. This ""uncleaved prefusion-optimized"" (UFO) approach, as they call it, yields Env trimers that are stabilized in the closed shape and can be produced efficiently, with surprisingly little need for purification, in the types of cells normally used in biotech manufacturing. ""By now in my lab weve made this modification to Envs from 30 to 40 different HIV strains, and in most of the cases it has worked like a charm,"" Zhu says. He and his colleagues further optimized their vaccine strategy by genetically linking their stabilized Env trimers, up to 60 at a time, to individual nanoparticles that mimic the globular shape of a whole virus. In this way the vaccine molecule, though artificial and lacking the genetic material for viral replication, seems to the immune system very much like a real invading virus and stimulates a stronger reaction. In mice, Zhu and his team found, a sample Env-on-nanoparticles vaccine, within just eight weeks, elicited antibodies that in lab tests successfully neutralized a naturally circulating HIV strain—of a type that prior candidate vaccines generally have failed against. ""This is the first time any candidate HIV vaccine has induced this desired type of antibody response in mice,"" Zhu says.Similarly unprecedented results were obtained in rabbits, demonstrating that the nanoparticle-based approach is clearly superior to the use of isolated Env proteins—it elicits a significantly stronger response and does so much more quickly. Further tests are now underway in 24 monkeys at the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Southwest National Primate Center in San Antonio, Texas. Zhu and Scripps Research have licensed their HIV vaccine technology to a startup company, Ufovax LLC, which is sponsoring the ongoing tests. ""Were now testing two candidate vaccines based on Env trimers from different HIV strains, plus a third candidate vaccine that is a cocktail of three Env-based vaccines,"" says Ji Li, Ufovax CEO.

Reproductive health encompasses key areas of the UNFPA vision – that every child is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect. Reproductive health problems remain the leading cause of ill health and death for women of childbearing age worldwide. Impoverished women, especially those living in developing countries, suffer disproportionately from unintended pregnancies, maternal death and disability, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, gender and other problems related to their reproductive system and sexual behaviour. Because young people often face barriers in trying to get the information or care they need, adolescent reproductive health is another important focus of UNFPA programming. And all programming relies on the availability of essential supplies. The critical importance of reproductive health to development has been acknowledged at the highest level. At the 2005 World Summit, world leaders added universal access to reproductive health as a target in Millennium Development Goals framework. UNFPA is fully committed to mobilizing support and scaling up efforts to make reproductive health for all a reality by 2015. Supporting the Constellation of Reproductive Rights During the 1990s, a series of important United Nations conferences emphasized that the well-being of individuals, and respect for their human rights, should be central to all development strategies. Particular emphasis was given to reproductive rights as a cornerstone of development. Reproductive rights were clarified and endorsed internationally in the Cairo Consensus that emerged from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. This constellation of rights, embracing fundamental human rights established by earlier treaties, was reaffirmed at the Beijing Conference and various international and regional agreements since, as well as in many national laws. They include the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of children, the right to voluntarily marry and establish a family, and the right to the highest attainable standard of health, among others. What are reproductive rights? Attaining the goals of sustainable, equitable development requires that individuals are able to exercise control over their sexual and reproductive lives. This includes the rights to: Reproductive health as a component of overall health, throughout the life cycle, for both men and women Reproductive decision-making, including voluntary choice in marriage, family formation and determination of the number, timing and spacing of ones children and the right to have access to the information and means needed to exercise voluntary choice Equality and equity for men and women, to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life, free from discrimination based on gender Sexual and reproductive security, including freedom from sexual violence and coercion, and the right to privacy. Reproductive rights and international development goals The importance of reproductive rights in terms of meeting international development goals has increasingly been recognized by the international community. In the September 2005 World Summit, the goal of universal access to reproductive health was endorsed at the highest level. Reproductive rights are recognized as valuable ends in themselves, and essential to the enjoyment of other fundamental rights. Special emphasis has been given to the reproductive rights of women and adolescent girls, and to the importance of sex education and reproductive health programmes. UNFPA at work One of the ways UNFPA can be most effective in protecting reproductive rights is by influencing policy and legislation. For example, the Fund works closely with parliamentarians and is involved in advocacy efforts to realize reproductive rights and the other goals set forth in the ICPD. In Guatemala, the Fund helped build consensus among a wide range of stakeholders that led to passage of a groundbreaking law that promotes better health for women and their families. In other cases, such as in Ecuador, UNFPA has helped enforce compliance of existing laws that protect reproductive rights. UNFPA is increasingly active in protecting reproductive rights during humanitarian response efforts and institutionalizing them during post-conflict reconstruction, rehabilitation and peace building, as called for by UN Security Council resolution 1325. The Fund also works to protect reproductive rights in the following thematic areas: Improving reproductive health Making motherhood safer Family planning Promoting gender equality Preventing HIV/AIDS Addressing gender-based violence Supporting adolescents and youth The Life Cycle Approach Reproductive health is a lifetime concern for both women and men, from infancy to old age. UNFPA supports programming tailored to the different challenges they face at different times in life. In many cultures, the discrimination against girls and women that begins in infancy can determine the trajectory of their lives. The important issues of education and appropriate health care arise in childhood and adolescence. These continue to be issues in the reproductive years, along with family planning, sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive tract infections, adequate nutrition and care in pregnancy, and the social status of women and concerns about cervical and breast cancer. Male attitudes towards gender and sexual relations arise in boyhood, when they are often set for life. Men need early socialization in concepts of sexual responsibility and ongoing education and support in order to experience full partnership in satisfying sexual relationships and family life. Critical messages for different life stages In its advocacy and programming, UNFPA focuses on key messages that can empower both women and men at different stages of their lives. Girls and boys Inform and empower girls to delay pregnancy until they are physically and emotionally mature. Inspire and motivate boys and men to be sexually responsible partners and value daughters equally as sons. Encourage governments to take responsibility for the human catastrophe of orphans and other children who live in the streets. Adolescents Reorient health education and services to meet the diverse needs of adolescents. Integrated reproductive health education and services for young people should include family planning information, and counselling on gender relations, STDs and HIV/AIDS, sexual abuse and reproductive health. Ensure that health care programmes and providers attitudes allow for adolescents access to the services and information they need. Support efforts to eradicate female genital cutting and other harmful practices, including early or forced marriage, sexual abuse, and trafficking of adolescents for forced labour, marriage or commercial sex. Socialize and motivate boys and young men to show respect and responsibility in sexual relations. Adulthood Improve communication between men and women on issues of sexuality and reproductive health, and the understanding of their joint responsibilities, so that they are equal partners in public and private life. Enable women to exercise their right to control their own fertility and their right to make decisions concerning reproduction, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Improve the quality and availability of reproductive health services and barriers to access. Make emergency obstetric care available to all women who experience complications in their pregnancies. Encourage mens responsibility for sexual and reproductive behaviour and increase male participation in family planning. The older years Reorient and strengthen health care services to better meet the needs of older women. Support outreach by womens NGOs to help older women in the community to better understand the importance of girls education, reproductive rights and sexual health so that they may become effective transmitters of this knowledge. Develop strategies to better meet needs of the elderly for food, water, shelter, social and legal services and health care. Improving Reproductive Health Services UNFPA supports a gender- and rights-based approach to reproductive and sexual health, one that empowers women throughout their lives. Reproductive rights become tangible, however, only when reproductive health services that offer a high quality of care are made widely available. Availability includes both affordability and convenience, which generally implies a range of services under one roof. The critical importance of reproductive health was endorsed at the highest level at the 2005 World Summit. At that convocation, the largest-ever gathering of world leaders recognized that reproductive health is critical to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. They reaffirmed the need to keep reproductive health high on the development agenda, and to make universal access to reproductive health by 2015 a reality. Priority concerns UNFPA gives priority to providing basic reproductive health services to young people, pregnant women, and hard-to-reach populations, including those displaced by humanitarian crises. Linking reproductive health services to HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment and care is increasingly being seen as a critical strategy to expanding access to both types of care. In recognition that men are integral to reproductive health, the Fund also is expanding its support to services that can make men healthier and more responsible sexual partners. Both men and women need access to information and appropriate health services throughout their lives. Such information and services should be gender sensitive and allow: All individuals to make informed choices about sexuality and reproduction, and to have a safe and satisfying sexual life, free of violence and coercion Women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth Couples to have the best chance of having a healthy infant Women to avoid unwanted pregnancy and to address the consequences of unsafe abortion Access to prevention, treatment and care for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Offering essential services Almost all programme countries struggle to expand access to services. Because of limited resources, many countries initially offer a core package of basic services, which can be expanded as resources become available. For the convenience of users, and streamlining of management, reproductive and sexual health services should be integrated within a system that offers primary health care and referrals for more specialized needs. A full sexual and reproductive health package includes: Family planning/birth spacing services Antenatal care, skilled attendance at delivery, and postnatal care Management of obstetric and neonatal complications and emergencies Prevention of abortion and management of complications resulting from unsafe abortion Prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS Early diagnosis and treatment for breast and cervical cancer Promotion, education and support for exclusive breast feeding Prevention and appropriate treatment of sub-fertility and infertility Active discouragement of harmful practices such as female genital cutting Adolescent sexual and reproductive health Prevention and management of gender-based violence Reproductive and sexual health is a societal concern Reproductive and sexual health is a societal issue — not only the responsibility of the health sector. It is important to build partnerships with other public and private sectors, as well as with civil society. Effective health service delivery can be achieved by: Partnerships with civil society Community involvement Integration of services Inclusion of health promotion activities Advocacy for sexual and reproductive health and rights Coordination across services, sectors, ministries Communities can play an important role in building demand for appropriate reproductive health services. For instance, they can mobilize and build awareness at the local level about reproductive health issues. They can organize to pool resources in micro-insurance schemes. They can collectively exert more pressure for public health service improvements than individuals. Such efforts can be especially effective and timely as health reform and decentralization is underway in many countries. Innovative and participatory approaches are needed to ensure that reproductive health issues receive adequate attention during this transition. The UNFPA-supported Stronger Voices project is a good example of how this can work. Ensuring that Every Pregnancy is Wanted At least 200 million women want to use safe and effective family planning methods, but are unable to do so because they lack access to information and services or the support of their husbands and communities. And more than 50 million of the 190 million women who become pregnant each year have abortions. Many of these are clandestine and performed under unsafe conditions. The need for voluntary family planning is growing fast, and it is estimated that the unmet need will grow by 40 per cent during the next 15 years. But even though it is an economically sound investment, family planning has been losing ground as an international development priority. Funding is decreasing, and the gap between the need and the available resources is growing. The international community has agreed that reproductive choice is a basic human right. But without access to relevant information and high-quality services, that right cannot be exercised. Family planning saves lives Guided by paragraph 8.25 of the Cairo Programme of Action, UNFPA does not support or promote abortion as a method of family planning. It accords the highest priority and support to voluntary family planning to prevent unwanted pregnancies so as to eliminate recourse to abortion. UNFPA supports governments to strengthen their national health systems to deal effectively with complications of unsafe abortions, thereby saving women’s lives (every year, an estimated 74,000 women die as the result of unsafe abortions). UNFPA works to make reproductive rights a reality by supporting family planning services throughout the developing world. These services, as well as the information needed to make good choices, are usually provided as part of a constellation of reproductive health services. Contraceptive use rises, but unmet needs remain Most women today want two, three or four children - fewer than in generations past. The use of modern contraceptive methods, including voluntary sterilization, has increased rapidly over the past 30 years, especially in countries with strong family planning programmes. In less developed regions, contraceptive use approaches 60 per cent of couples. Most of this increase reflects greater contraceptive use by women. But in many countries, poverty and profound inequalities between men and women limit womens ability to plan their pregnancies. So does lack of access to effective contraceptive protection. Differing patterns of contraceptive use may not reflect womens personal preferences as much as political and economic decisions made by governments to emphasize certain methods, the attitudes of medical professionals, cost, the limited range of methods offered in some countries or an uneven availability of contraceptive supplies. Widening the options Two new contraceptives for women: once-a-month injectables and the female condom have become available since 1994. Fewer than 5 per cent of couples in the majority of developing countries rely on modern male methods (the condom or vasectomy). The level of unintended pregnancy is lowest in countries with greatest access to effective methods of contraception and where women play a major role in family decision-making. This goal of universal access to services needed to allow couples to exercise their full reproductive rights remains elusive: one evaluation found that family planning services are routinely made available to women at a reasonable cost in only 14 of 88 developing countries studies. Moving forward UNFPA supports family planning services that: offer a wide selection of methods reflect high standards of medical practice are sensitive to cultural conditions provide sufficient information about proper use or possible side effects address womens other reproductive health needs UNFPA is committed to closing the gap between the number of individuals who use contraceptives and those who would like to space or limit their families. The Fund rejects any form of coercion with respect to family planning, including the use of targets or quotas for the recruitment of clients.

Reproductive health and STI,,,,,"Reproductive health and STI WHO Within the framework of WHOs definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, reproductive health addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life. Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this are the right of men and women to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of fertility regulation of their choice, and the right of access to appropriate health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Key facts More than 1 million people acquire a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every day. Each year, an estimated 500 million people become ill with one of 4 STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. More than 530 million people have the virus that causes genital herpes (HSV2). More than 290 million women have a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The majority of STIs are present without symptoms. Some STIs can increase the risk of HIV acquisition three-fold or more. STIs can have serious consequences beyond the immediate impact of the infection itself, through mother-to-child transmission of infections and chronic diseases. Drug resistance, especially for gonorrhoea, is a major threat to reducing the impact of STIs worldwide. What are sexually transmitted infections and how are they transmitted? STIs are caused by more than 30 different bacteria, viruses and parasites and are spread predominantly by sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex. Some STIs may be spread via skin-to-skin sexual contact. The organisms causing STIs can also be spread through non-sexual means such as blood products and tissue transfer. Many STIs—including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, hepatitis B, HIV, HPV, HSV2 and syphilis—can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth. A person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease. Therefore, the term “sexually transmitted infection” is a broader term than “sexually transmitted disease” (STD). Common symptoms of STDs include vaginal discharge, urethral discharge in men, genital ulcers, and abdominal pain. Eight of the more than 30 pathogens known to be transmitted through sexual contact have been linked to the greatest incidence of illness. Of these 8 infections, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other four are viral infections and are incurable, but can be mitigated or modulated through treatment: hepatitis B, herpes, HIV, and HPV. Scope of the problem STIs have a profound impact on sexual and reproductive health worldwide, and rank among the top 5 disease categories for which adults seek health care. More than 1 million people acquire a sexually transmitted infection every day. Each year, an estimated 500 million people acquire one of four sexually transmitted infections: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. More than 530 million people are living with HSV2. More than 290 million women have an HPV infection, one of the most common STIs. Estimated new cases of curable sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis and trichomoniasis) by WHO region, 2008 STIs can have serious consequences beyond the immediate impact of the infection itself. Some STIs can increase the risk of HIV acquisition three-fold or more. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can result in stillbirth, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy leads to approximately 305 000 fetal and neonatal deaths every year and leaves 215 000 infants at increased risk of dying from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease. HPV infection causes 530 000 cases of cervical cancer and 275 000 cervical cancer deaths each year. STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia are major causes of pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and infertility. Prevention of STIs Counselling and behavioural approaches Counselling and behavioural interventions offer primary prevention against STIs (including HIV), as well as against unintended pregnancies. These include: comprehensive sexuality education, STI and HIV pre- and post-test counselling; safer sex/risk-reduction counselling, condom promotion; and interventions targeted at key and vulnerable populations, such as adolescents, sex workers, men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. In addition, counselling can improve people’s ability to recognize the symptoms of STIs and increase the likelihood they will seek care or encourage a sexual partner to do so. Unfortunately, lack of public awareness, lack of training of health workers, and long-standing, widespread stigma around STIs remain barriers to greater and more effective use of these interventions. Barrier methods When used correctly and consistently, condoms offer one of the most effective methods of protection against STIs, including HIV. Female condoms are effective and safe, but are not used as widely by national programmes as male condoms. Diagnosis of STIs Accurate diagnostic tests for STIs are widely used in high-income countries. These are especially useful for the diagnosis of asymptomatic infections. However, in low- and middle-income countries, diagnostic tests are largely unavailable. Where testing is available, it is often expensive and geographically inaccessible; and patients often need to wait a long time (or need to return) to receive results. As a result, follow up can be impeded and care or treatment can be incomplete. The only inexpensive, rapid blood test currently available for an STI is for syphilis. This test is already in use in some resource-limited settings. The test is accurate, can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, and is easy to use with minimal training. Rapid syphilis tests have been shown to increase the number of pregnant women tested for syphilis. However, increased efforts are still needed in most low- and middle-income countries to ensure that all pregnant women receive a syphilis test. Several rapid tests for other STIs are under development and have the potential to improve STI diagnosis and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings. Treatment of STIs Effective treatment is currently available for several STIs. Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are generally curable with existing, effective single-dose regimens of antibiotics. For herpes and HIV, the most effective medications available are antivirals that can modulate the course of the disease, though they cannot cure the disease. For hepatitis B, immune system modulators (interferon) and antiviral medications can help to fight the virus and slow damage to the liver. Resistance of STIs—in particular gonorrhoea—to antibiotics has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options. The emergence of decreased susceptibility of gonorrhoea to the “last line” treatment option (oral and injectable cephalosporins) together with antimicrobial resistance already shown to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides make gonorrhoea a multidrug-resistant organism. Antimicrobial resistance for other STIs, though less common, also exists, making prevention and prompt treatment critical. STI case management Low- and middle-income countries rely on syndromic management, which is based on the identification of consistent groups of symptoms and easily recognized signs (syndromes) to guide treatment, without the use of laboratory tests. This approach, which often relies on clinical algorithms, allows health workers to diagnose a specific infection on the basis of observed syndromes. Syndromic management is simple, assures rapid, same-day treatment, and avoids expensive or unavailable diagnostic tests. However, this approach misses infections that do not demonstrate any syndromes - the majority of STIs globally. Vaccines and other biomedical interventions Safe and highly effective vaccines are available for 2 STIs: hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). These vaccines have represented major advances in STI prevention. The vaccine against hepatitis B is included in infant immunization programmes in 93% of countries and has already prevented an estimated 1.3 million deaths from chronic liver disease and cancer. HPV vaccine is available as part of routine immunization programmes in 45 countries, most of them high- and middle-income. HPV vaccination could prevent the deaths of more than 4 million women over the next decade in low- and middle-income countries, where most cases of cervical cancer occur, if 70% vaccination coverage can be achieved. Research to develop vaccines against herpes and HIV is advanced, though no viable vaccine candidates for either infection have yet emerged. Research into vaccines for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis is in earlier stages of development. Other biomedical interventions to prevent some STIs include adult male circumcision and microbicides. Male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 60% and provides some protection against other STIs, such as herpes and HPV. Tenofovir gel, a microbicide with the potential to allow women to actively avert HIV acquisition, reached “proof of concept” stage in clinical trials in 2010. Further clinical research to support regulatory approval of its safety and effectiveness is underway. Current efforts to contain the spread of STIs are not sufficient Behaviour change is complex Despite considerable efforts to identify simple interventions that can reduce risky sexual behaviour, behaviour change remains a complex challenge. Research has demonstrated the need to focus on carefully defined populations, consult extensively with the identified target populations, and involve them in design, implementation and evaluation. Health services for screening and treatment of STIs remain weak People seeking screening and treatment for STIs face numerous problems. These include limited resources, stigmatization, poor quality of services, and little or no follow-up of sexual partners. In many countries, STI services are provided separately and not available in primary health care, family planning and other routine health services. In many settings, services are often unable to provide screening for asymptomatic infections, lacking trained personnel, laboratory capacity and adequate supplies of appropriate medicines. Marginalized populations with the highest rates of STIs—such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, prison inmates, mobile populations and adolescents—often do not have access to adequate health services. WHO response WHO develops global norms and standards for STI treatment and prevention, strengthens systems for surveillance and monitoring, including those for drug-resistant gonorrhoea, and leads the setting of the global research agenda on STIs. Our work is guided by Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6, the global strategy for the prevention and control of STIs adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2006 and the 2010 United Nations Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Womens and Childrens Health, which highlights the need for a comprehensive, integrated package of essential interventions, including information and services for the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. WHO works with countries to: Scale-up effective STI services including: STI case management and counseling syphilis testing and treatment, in particular for pregnant women hepatitis B and HPV vaccination. Promote strategies to enhance STI-prevention impact including: integrate STI services into existing health systems promote sexual health measure the burden of STIs monitor and respond to STI antimicrobial resistance. Support the development of new technologies for STI prevention such as: point-of care diagnostic tests for STIs additional drugs for gonorrhoea STI vaccines and other biomedical interventions.

WHO on Adolescent Health,,,,,"WHO on Adolescent Health Adolescents – young people between the ages of 10 and 19 years – are often thought of as a healthy group. Nevertheless, many adolescents do die prematurely due to accidents, suicide, violence, pregnancy related complications and other illnesses that are either preventable or treatable. Many more suffer chronic ill-health and disability. In addition, many serious diseases in adulthood have their roots in adolescence. For example, tobacco use, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, poor eating and exercise habits, lead to illness or premature death later in life. Adolescents: health risks and solutions Around 1 in 6 persons in the world is an adolescent: that is 1.2 billion people aged 10 to 19. Most are healthy, but there is still significant death, illness and diseases among adolescents. Illnesses can hinder their ability to grow and develop to their full potential. Alcohol or tobacco use, lack of physical activity, unprotected sex and/or exposure to violence can jeopardize not only their current health, but often their health for years to come, and even the health of their future children. Promoting healthy practices during adolescence, and taking steps to better protect young people from health risks are critical for the prevention of health problems in adulthood, and for countries’ future health and social infrastructure. Main health issues include: Early pregnancy and childbirth Complications linked to pregnancy and childbirth are the second cause of death for 15-19-year-old girls globally. Some 11% of all births worldwide are to girls aged 15 to 19 years, and the vast majority are in low- and middle-income countries. The 2014 World Health Statistics put the global adolescent birth rate at 49 per 1000 girls this age - country rates range from 1 to 229 births per 1000 girls. This indicates a marked decrease since 1990. This decrease is reflected in a similar decline in maternal mortality rates among 15-19 year olds. One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030, the world should ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes. To support this, a proposed indicator for the ""Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health"" is the adolescent birth rate. Better access to contraceptive information and services can reduce the number of girls becoming pregnant and giving birth at too young an age. Laws that specify a minimum age of marriage at 18 and which are enforced can help. Girls who do become pregnant need access to quality antenatal care. Where permitted by law, adolescents who opt to terminate their pregnancies should have access to safe abortion. HIV More than 2 million adolescents are living with HIV. Although the overall number of HIV-related deaths is down 30% since the peak in 2006 estimates suggest that HIV deaths among adolescents are rising. This increase, which has been predominantly in the WHO Africa Region, may reflect the fact that although more children with HIV survive into adolescence, they do not all then get the care and support they need to remain in good health and prevent transmission. In sub-Saharan Africa only 10% of young men and 15% of young women aged 15 to 24 are aware of their HIV status. One of the specific targets of the health Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) is that by 2030, there should be an end to the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases, hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. Given their high incidence rate, to achieve this, adolescents will need to be central to control efforts. Young people need to know how to protect themselves and have the means to do so. This includes being able to obtain condoms to prevent sexual transmission of the virus and clean needles and syringes for those who inject drugs. Better access to HIV testing and counselling, and stronger subsequent links to HIV treatment services for those who test HIV positive, are also needed. Other infectious diseases Thanks to improved childhood vaccination, adolescent deaths and disability from measles have fallen markedly – for example, by 90% in the African Region between 2000 and 2012. But diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections and meningitis are among the top 10 causes of death for 10 to 19 year olds. Mental health Depression is the top cause of illness and disability among adolescents and suicide is the third cause of death. Violence, poverty, humiliation and feeling devalued can increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Building life skills in children and adolescents and providing them with psychosocial support in schools and other community settings can help promote good mental health. Programmes to help strengthen ties between adolescents and their families are also important. If problems arise, they should be detected and managed by competent and caring health workers. Violence Violence is a leading cause of death. An estimated 180 adolescents die every day as a result of interpersonal violence. Around 1 of every 3 deaths among adolescent males of the low- and middle-income countries in the WHO Americas Region is due to violence. Globally, some 30% of girls aged 15 to 19 experience violence by a partner. Promoting nurturing relationships between parents and children early in life, providing training in life skills, and reducing access to alcohol and firearms can help to prevent violence. Effective and empathetic care for adolescent survivors of violence and ongoing support can help deal with the physical and the psychological consequences. Alcohol and drugs Harmful drinking among adolescents is a major concern in many countries. It reduces self-control and increases risky behaviours, such as unsafe sex or risky driving. It is a primary cause of injuries (including those due to road traffic accidents), violence (especially by a partner) and premature deaths. It also can lead to health problems in later life and affect life expectancy. Setting a minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol and regulating how alcoholic drinks are targeted at the younger market are among the strategies for reducing harmful drinking. Drug use among 15 to 19 year olds is also a concern. Injuries Unintentional injuries are a leading cause of death and disability among adolescents. In 2012, some 120 000 adolescents died as a result of road traffic accidents. Young drivers need advice on driving safely, while laws that prohibit driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs need to be strictly enforced. Blood alcohol levels need to be set lower for teenage drivers. Graduated licences for novice drivers with zero-tolerance for drink-driving are recommended. Drowning is also a major cause of death among adolescents – 60 000, two-thirds of them boys, drowned in 2012, and teaching children and adolescents to swim is a useful intervention to prevent this.. Malnutrition and obesity Many boys and girls in developing countries enter adolescence undernourished, making them more vulnerable to disease and early death. The number of adolescents who are overweight or obese is increasing in both low- and high-income countries. Exercise and nutrition Available survey data indicate that fewer than 1 in every 4 adolescents meets the recommended guidelines for physical activity - 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily. Anaemia resulting from a lack of iron affects girls and boys, and is the third cause of years lost to death and disability. Iron and folic acid supplements help to promote health before adolescents become parents, and regular deworming in areas where intestinal helminths such as hookworm are common is recommended. Developing healthy eating and exercise habits at this age are foundations for good health in adulthood. Reducing the marketing of foods high in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars, or salt and providing access to healthy foods and opportunities to engage in physical activity are important for all but especially children and adolescents. Tobacco use The vast majority of people using tobacco today began doing so when they were adolescents. Prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors and increasing the price of tobacco products through higher taxes, banning tobacco advertising and ensuring smoke-free environments are crucial. Globally, at least 1 in 10 younger adolescents (aged 13 to 15) uses tobacco, although there are areas where this figure is much higher. Cigarette smoking seems to be decreasing among younger adolescents in some high-income countries. Rights of adolescents The rights of children (people aged between 0-17 years) to survive, grow and develop are enshrined in international legal documents. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which oversees the child rights convention, in 2013 published guidelines on the right of children and adolescents to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, and a General Comment on realizing the rights of children during adolescence is under development, building on existing CRC guidelines on states’ obligations to recognise the special health and development needs and rights of adolescents and young people. The Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) also sets out the rights of women and girls to health and adequate health care. WHO response In May 2014, WHO published a major report called “Health for the world’s adolescents”. The report analyses what is known about adolescents’ health, including what promotes or undermines it, highlights gaps in policies and services, and draws together guidance and recommendations from across WHO. The report, which focuses on the health sector, examines areas of significant improvements and innovative approaches. WHO also provides technical advice to the UN Secretary General’s Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health, and is working with other UN agencies and partners to develop a Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!) Framework, which will aim to help countries to decide what to do in adolescent health and how to do it. Overall, WHO carries out a range of functions to improve the health of young people, including: production of evidence-based guidelines to support health services and other sectors; making recommendations to governments on adolescent health and the provision of high quality, age-appropriate health services for adolescents; raising awareness of health issues for young people among the general public and special groups.",{},"['death', 'young', 'hiv', 'adolescents', 'adolescent', 'violence', 'girls', 'health', 'cause', 'children']","Adolescents: health risks and solutionsAround 1 in 6 persons in the world is an adolescent: that is 1.2 billion people aged 10 to 19.

But it is also time to take stock of how women’s rights are fulfilled in the world --especially the right to health. Twenty years after countries signed pledges in the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, women still face many health problems and we must re-commit to addressing them. Here are ten of the main issues regarding womens health that keep me awake at night: Cancer: Two of the most common cancers affecting women are breast and cervical cancers. Detecting both these cancers early is key to keeping women alive and healthy. The latest global figures show that around half a million women die from cervical cancer and half a million from breast cancer each year. The vast majority of these deaths occur in low and middle income countries where screening, prevention and treatment are almost non-existent, and where vaccination against human papilloma virus needs to take hold. Dr Flavia Bustreo Assistant Director General for Family, Women’s and Children’s Health through the Life-course, World Health Organization In 2015, in too many countries, “women’s empowerment” remains a pipedream - little more than a rhetorical flourish added to a politician’s speech... Reproductive health: Sexual and reproductive health problems are responsible for one third of health issues for women between the ages of 15 and 44 years. Unsafe sex is a major risk factor – particularly among women and girls in developing countries. This is why it is so important to get services to the 222 million women who aren’t getting the contraception services they need. Maternal health: Many women are now benefitting from massive improvements in care during pregnancy and childbirth introduced in the last century. But those benefits do not extend everywhere and in 2013, almost 300 000 women died from complications in pregnancy and childbirth. Most of these deaths could have been prevented, had access to family planning and to some quite basic services been in place. HIV: Three decades into the AIDS epidemic, it is young women who bear the brunt of new HIV infections. Too many young women still struggle to protect themselves against sexual transmission of HIV and to get the treatment they require. This also leaves them particularly vulnerable to tuberculosis - one of the leading causes of death in low-income countries of women 20–59 years. Sexually transmitted infections: I’ve already mentioned the importance of protecting against HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (the world’s most common STI). But it is also vital to do a better job of preventing and treating diseases like gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis. Untreated syphilis is responsible for more than 200,000 stillbirths and early foetal deaths every year, and for the deaths of over 90 000 newborns. Violence against women: Women can be subject to a range of different forms of violence, but physical and sexual violence – either by a partner or someone else – is particularly invidious. Today, one in three women under 50 has experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner, or non-partner sexual violence – violence which affects their physical and mental health in the short and long-term. It’s important for health workers to be alert to violence so they can help prevent it, as well as provide support to people who experience it. Mental health: Evidence suggests that women are more prone than men to experience anxiety, depression, and somatic complaints – physical symptoms that cannot be explained medically. Depression is the most common mental health problem for women and suicide a leading cause of death for women under 60. Helping sensitise women to mental health issues, and giving them the confidence to seek assistance, is vital. Noncommunicable diseases: In 2012, some 4.7 million women died from noncommunicable diseases before they reached the age of 70 —most of them in low- and middle-income countries. They died as a result of road traffic accidents, harmful use of tobacco, abuse of alcohol, drugs and substances, and obesity -- more than 50% of women are overweight in Europe and the Americas. Helping girls and women adopt healthy lifestyles early on is key to a long and healthy life. Being young: Adolescent girls face a number of sexual and reproductive health challenges: STIs, HIV, and pregnancy. About 13 million adolescent girls (under 20) give birth every year. Complications from those pregnancies and childbirth are a leading cause of death for those young mothers. Many suffer the consequences of unsafe abortion. Getting older: Having often worked in the home, older women may have fewer pensions and benefits, less access to health care and social services than their male counterparts. Combine the greater risk of poverty with other conditions of old age, like dementia, and older women also have a higher risk of abuse and generally, poor health. When I lie awake thinking of women and their health globally, I remind myself: the world has made a lot of progress in recent years. We know more, and we are getting better at applying our knowledge. At providing young girls a good start in life. And there has been an upsurge in high-level political will – evidenced most recently in the United Nations Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health. Use of services, especially those for sexual and reproductive health, has increased in some countries. Two important factors that influence women’s health – namely, school enrolment rates for girls and greater political participation of women - have risen in many parts of the world. But we are not there yet. In 2015, in too many countries, “women’s empowerment” remains a pipedream - little more than a rhetorical flourish added to a politician’s speech. Too many women are still missing out on the opportunity to get educated, support themselves, and obtain the health services they need, when they need them. That’s why WHO is working so hard to strengthen health systems and ensure that countries have robust financing systems and sufficient numbers of well-trained, motivated health workers. That’s why WHO, with UN and world partners, are coming together at the UN Commission on Status of Women from 9-20 March 2015 in New York. We will look again at pledges made in the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action with a view to renewing the global effort to remove the inequalities that put decent health services beyond so many women’s reach. And that is why WHO and its partners are developing a new global strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health, and working to enshrine the health of women in the post 2015 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. This means not only setting targets and indicators, but catalysing commitments in terms of policy, financing and action, to ensure that the future will bring health to all women and girls – whoever they are, wherever they live.",{},"['sexual', 'countries', 'young', 'issues', 'violence', 'women', 'girls', 'womens', 'health', 'million', 'services']","Here are ten of the main issues regarding women's health that keep me awake at night:Cancer: Two of the most common cancers affecting women are breast and cervical cancers.

At six months, other foods should complement breastfeeding for up to two years or more. In addition: breastfeeding should begin within an hour of birth; breastfeeding should be ""on demand"", as often as the child wants day and night; and bottles or pacifiers should be avoided. Health benefits for infants Breast milk is the ideal food for newborns and infants. It gives infants all the nutrients they need for healthy development. It is safe and contains antibodies that help protect infants from common childhood illnesses - such as diarrhoea and pneumonia, the two primary causes of child mortality worldwide. Breast milk is readily available and affordable, which helps to ensure that infants get adequate sustenance. Benefits for mothers Breastfeeding also benefits mothers. The practice when done exclusively is associated with a natural (though not fail-safe) method of birth control (98% of protection in the first 6 months after birth). It reduces risks of breast and ovarian cancer later in life, helps women return to their pre-pregnancy weight faster, and lowers rates of obesity. Long-term benefits for children Beyond the immediate benefits for children, breastfeeding contributes to a lifetime of good health. Adults who were breastfed as babies often have lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol, as well as lower rates of overweight, obesity and type-2 diabetes. There is evidence that people who were breastfed perform better in intelligence tests. Why not infant formula? Infant formula does not contain the antibodies found in breast milk. When infant formula is not properly prepared, there are some risks arising from the use of unsafe water and unsterilized equipment or the potential presence of bacteria in powdered formula. Malnutrition can result from over-diluting formula to ""stretch"" supplies. Further, frequent feedings maintain the breast milk supply. If formula is used but becomes unavailable, a return to breastfeeding may not be an option due to diminished breast milk production. HIV and breastfeeding An HIV-infected mother can pass the infection to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and through breastfeeding. Antiretroviral (ARV) drug interventions to either the mother or HIV-exposed infant reduces the risk of transmission of HIV through breastfeeding. Together, breastfeeding and ARV interventions have the potential to significantly improve infants chances of surviving while remaining HIV uninfected. WHO recommends that when HIV-infected mothers breastfeed, they should receive ARVs and follow WHO guidance for breastfeeding and complementary feeding. Regulating breast-milk substitutes An international code to regulate the marketing of breast-milk substitutes was adopted in 1981. It calls for: all formula labels and information to state the benefits of breastfeeding and the health risks of substitutes; no promotion of breast-milk substitutes; no free samples of substitutes to be given to pregnant women, mothers or their families; and no distribution of free or subsidized substitutes to health workers or facilities. Support for mothers is essential Breastfeeding has to be learned and many women encounter difficulties at the beginning. Nipple pain, and fear that there is not enough milk to sustain the baby are common. Health facilities that support breastfeeding - by making trained breastfeeding counsellors available to new mothers - encourage higher rates of the practice. To provide this support and improve care for mothers and newborns, there are now more than 20 000 ""baby-friendly"" facilities in 152 countries thanks to a WHO-UNICEF initiative. Work and breastfeeding Many mothers who return to work abandon breastfeeding partially or completely because they do not have sufficient time, or a place to breastfeed, express and store their milk. Mothers need a safe, clean and private place in or near their work to continue breastfeeding. Enabling conditions at work can help, such as paid maternity leave, part-time work arrangements, on-site crèches, facilities for expressing and storing breast milk, and breastfeeding breaks. The next step: phasing in new foods To meet the growing needs of babies at six months of age, complementary foods should be introduced as they continue to breastfeed. Foods for the baby can be specially prepared or modified from family meals. WHO notes that: breastfeeding should not be decreased when starting complementary feeding; complementary foods should be given with a spoon or cup, not in a bottle; foods should be clean, safe and locally available; and ample time is needed for young children to learn to eat solid foods.

In the lead-up to 1 December, the #my right to health campaign will explore the challenges people around the world face in exercising their right to health. The “#my right to health campaign will provide information about the right to health and what impact it has on people’s lives. It will also aim to increase the visibility around the need to achieve the full realization of the right to health by everyone, everywhere. Almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals are linked in some way to health, so achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which include ending the AIDS epidemic, will depend heavily on ensuring the right to health (UNAIDS 2017). The right to health is the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as enshrined in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This includes the right of everyone including people living with and affected by HIV, to the prevention and treatment of ill health, to make decisions about one’s own health and to be treated with respect and dignity and without discrimination. Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live, has a right to health, which is also dependent on adequate sanitation and housing, nutritious food, healthy working conditions and access to justice. The right to health is supported by, and linked to, a wider set of rights. Without the conditions to ensure access to justice, the right to a clean environment, the right to be free from violence or the right to education, for example, we cannot fulfill our right to health. Ending AIDS as a public health threat can only happen if these rights are placed at the centre of global health, so that quality health care is available and accessible for everyone and leaves no one behind. Bangladesh continues to be a low prevalence country, albeit one with very high vulnerability. Levels of risk behavior, in terms of high levels of unprotected sex with commercial partners, and unsafe injecting practices, make the country very vulnerable. Condom use is in Bangladesh is reportedly lowest in Asia, although the figures have been rising, due to NGO interventions. The porous borders with India and Myanmar, which are experiencing concentrated epidemics and high migration both within the country and across the borders, increase the vulnerability. Now in Bangladesh, the number of HIV infected persons are 12000 and the number of injecting drug users are 33066. The sero-surveillance of 2016 reported that the prevalence was increased from 3 percent to 22 percent among the intravenous drug users (IDUs) in last five years in old Dhaka (UNAIDS/July 2017). IDUs are not isolated population, they have considerably complicated sexual networks through their marriage, and high number of commercial or casual sexual contacts and the endemic can spiral out. IDUs in old Dhaka – the one pocket of a particular sub-population, though the infection was at epidemic levels (“Epidemic” in a low-prevalence country is defined at more than 5% in high population; the rate in this particular pocket of that specific group was more than 4 times higher). This was enormously valuable data, as it allowed for a targeted response to the infection. One question remained, though. Why was the rate of infection so high in that particular area (especially among males), but not elsewhere of the country? One hypothesis is that the area is close to big hospital (Dhaka Medical College & Hospital) and a high concentration of pharmacies serving the hospital patients. It seems possible that the ready access of hypodermic needles and pethidine, a drug similar to morphine and heroin, led to an unusual rate of addiction in the area. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the interdependence and complexity of a changing world and the imperative for global collective action. In shifting from so-called development for the poorest countries to sustainable development for all, the global agenda has expanded in scope and complexity. As a set of indivisible goals, the SDGs give all stakeholders a mandate for integration of efforts. The AIDS response is no exception: the epidemic cannot be ended without addressing the determinants of health and vulnerability, and the holistic needs of people at risk of and living with HIV. People living with HIV often live in fragile communities, and are most affected by discrimination, inequality and instability. Their concerns must be at the forefront of sustainable development efforts. By extension, lessons learned from the multisectoral, multi-stakeholder AIDS response are key to progress across the SDGs. The AIDS response has advanced such issues as the right to health, gender equality, health information systems, service delivery platforms, commodity access and security and social protection. The response has garnered substantial experience in addressing entrenched social norms, social exclusion and legal barriers that undermine health and development outcomes, and its investment approach is increasingly being adopted to accelerate gains across global health and development. The AIDS response can be a leader in leveraging strategic intersections with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while disseminating lessons learned from three decades of unprecedented progress. No single prevention method or approach can stop the HIV epidemic on its own. Several methods and interventions have proved highly effective in reducing the risk of, and protecting against, HIV infection, including male and female condoms, the use of antiretroviral medicines as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC), behaviour change interventions to reduce the number of sexual partners, the use of clean needles and syringes, opiate substitution therapy (e.g. methadone) and the treatment of people living with HIV to reduce viral load and prevent onward transmission. Despite the availability of this widening array of effective HIV prevention tools and methods and a massive scale-up of HIV treatment in recent years, new infections among adults globally have not decreased sufficiently. The 2016 United Nations Political Declaration on Ending AIDS target is to reduce new HIV infections to fewer than 500 000 by 2020, from more than 1.8 million in 2016. Three interconnected reasons seem to underpin the failure to implement effective programs at scale: lack of political commitment and, as a result, inadequate investments; reluctance to address sensitive issues related to young people’s sexual and reproductive needs and rights, and to key populations and harm reduction; and a lack of systematic prevention implementation, even where policy environments permit it. Since the discovery of AIDS in 1981 and its cause, the HIV retrovirus, in 1983, dozens of new antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV have been developed. Different classes of antiretroviral medicines work against HIV in different ways and when combined are much more effective at controlling the virus and less likely to promote drug-resistance than when given singly. Combination treatment with at least three different antiretroviral medicines is now standard treatment for all people newly diagnosed with HIV. Combination antiretroviral therapy stops HIV from multiplying and can eradicate the virus from the blood. This allows a person’s immune system to recover, overcome infections and prevent the development of AIDS and other long-term effects of HIV infection. nCivil society activists, working closely with researchers and national regulatory authorities, promoted unprecedented investment in AIDS research and accelerated access to new medicines. This enabled new medicines and combinations to get to patients faster than ever before. Pressure from the global AIDS movement also ensured that the prices of new medicines were rapidly brought down to make them affordable to almost every country in the world. Currently, there are 19.5 million people globally on HIV treatment. A person living with HIV who starts antiretroviral therapy today will have the same life expectancy as an HIV-negative person of the same age. Antiretroviral therapy results in better outcomes when started early after HIV infection rather than delaying treatment until symptoms develop. Antiretroviral therapy prevents HIV-related illness and disability and saves lives. AIDS-related deaths have globally declined by 43% since 2003. Antiretroviral therapy also has a prevention benefit. The risk of HIV transmission to an HIV-negative sexual partner is reduced by 96% if the partner living with HIV is taking antiretroviral therapy. Community action translates into results. They can achieve improved health outcomes, mobilize demand for services, reach people with services difficult to reach with formal health systems, support health systems strengthening, mobilize political leadership, change social attitudes and norms, and create an enabling environment that promotes equal access. Community responses to HIV include: (1) Advocacy and participation of civil society in decision-making, monitoring and reporting on progress made in delivering HIV responses (2) Direct participation in service delivery, including HIV-related health services, prevention, sexual and reproductive health and human rights-services (3) Participatory community-based research, and (4) Community financing. Community responses to HIV are essential to ending the AIDS epidemic, and they are a model on how to reach Sustainable Development Goal 16 (promote peaceful and inclusive societies). To ensure the right to health, a human rights-based health system is needed, which includes four key elements: (1) Access: health care must be affordable or free and comprehensive for everyone (2) Availability: there must be adequate health-care infrastructure and staff (3) Acceptability: health-care services must be respectful, non-discriminatory, culturally appropriate and treat everyone with dignity; and (4) Quality: all health care must be medically appropriate and of good quality. States should adhere to the following basic human rights obligations: (1) Respect: refrain from interfering with a person’s ability to fulfill their right to health (2) Protect: act to prevent third parties from interfering with a person’s ability to fulfill their right to health (3) Fulfill: adopt appropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, promotional and other measures to enable everyone to fully realize their right to health and put measures in place to actively inform and promote the fulfillment of the right to health (4) Almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals are linked some way to health (5) Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including ending AIDS as a public health threat, will depend heavily on ensuring the right to health for all; and (6) Only by placing rights at the centre of global health can quality health care be available and accessible for everyone, leaving no one behind.

It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility (this fact sheet focuses on contraception). Benefits of family planningcontraception Promotion of family planning – and ensuring access to preferred contraceptive methods for women and couples – is essential to securing the well-being and autonomy of women, while supporting the health and development of communities. Preventing pregnancy-related health risks in women A woman’s ability to choose if and when to become pregnant has a direct impact on her health and well-being. Family planning allows spacing of pregnancies and can delay pregnancies in young women at increased risk of health problems and death from early childbearing. It prevents unintended pregnancies, including those of older women who face increased risks related to pregnancy. Family planning enables women who wish to limit the size of their families to do so. Evidence suggests that women who have more than 4 children are at increased risk of maternal mortality. By reducing rates of unintended pregnancies, family planning also reduces the need for unsafe abortion. Reducing infant mortality Family planning can prevent closely spaced and ill-timed pregnancies and births, which contribute to some of the world’s highest infant mortality rates. Infants of mothers who die as a result of giving birth also have a greater risk of death and poor health. Helping to prevent HIV/AIDS Family planning reduces the risk of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV, resulting in fewer infected babies and orphans. In addition, male and female condoms provide dual protection against unintended pregnancies and against STIs including HIV. Empowering people and enhancing education Family planning enables people to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health. Family planning represents an opportunity for women to pursue additional education and participate in public life, including paid employment in non-family organizations. Additionally, having smaller families allows parents to invest more in each child. Children with fewer siblings tend to stay in school longer than those with many siblings. Reducing adolescent pregnancies Pregnant adolescents are more likely to have preterm or low birth-weight babies. Babies born to adolescents have higher rates of neonatal mortality. Many adolescent girls who become pregnant have to leave school. This has long-term implications for them as individuals, their families and communities. Slowing population growth Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts. Who provides family planningcontraceptives? It is important that family planning is widely available and easily accessible through midwives and other trained health workers to anyone who is sexually active, including adolescents. Midwives are trained to provide (where authorised) locally available and culturally acceptable contraceptive methods. Other trained health workers, for example community health workers, also provide counselling and some family planning methods, for example pills and condoms. For methods such as sterilization, women and men need to be referred to a clinician. Contraceptive use Contraceptive use has increased in many parts of the world, especially in Asia and Latin America, but continues to be low in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, use of modern contraception has risen slightly, from 54% in 1990 to 57.4% in 2015. Regionally, the proportion of women aged 15–49 reporting use of a modern contraceptive method has risen minimally or plateaued between 2008 and 2015. In Africa it went from 23.6% to 28.5%, in Asia it has risen slightly from 60.9% to 61.8%, and in Latin America and the Caribbean it has remained stable at 66.7%. Use of contraception by men makes up a relatively small subset of the above prevalence rates. The modern contraceptive methods for men are limited to male condoms and sterilization (vasectomy). Global unmet need for contraception 214 million women of reproductive age in developing countries who want to avoid pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method. Reasons for this include: limited choice of methods; limited access to contraception, particularly among young people, poorer segments of populations, or unmarried people; fear or experience of side-effects; cultural or religious opposition; poor quality of available services; users and providers bias gender-based barriers. The unmet need for contraception remains too high. This inequity is fuelled by both a growing population, and a shortage of family planning services. In Africa, 24.2% of women of reproductive age have an unmet need for modern contraception. In Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean – regions with relatively high contraceptive prevalence – the levels of unmet need are 10.2 % and 10.7%, respectively (Trends in Contraception Worldwide 2015, UNDESA).

Drugs and crime in Bangladesh,,,,,"Drugs and crime in Bangladesh Despite recent strong economic growth, poverty in Bangladesh continues to be pervasive. Nearly half of its 160 million population live below the poverty line. Bangladesh features the third highest number of poor people living in a single country after India and China. These challenges are magnified by a population density of roughly 800 people per square kilometre—one of the highest in the world. Such poverty fuels many high-risk behaviour patterns, including commercial sex work. This is obviously a risk factor for the spread of HIV. While, as an Islamic country, Bangladesh proscribes the consumption of alcohol, there is significant abuse of this substance. Porous borders with India and Myanmar permit trafficking in drugs and other contraband. Drug Situation Production and cultivation Cannabis is still cultivated, particularly in the districts of Naogaon, Rajshahi, Jamalpur and Netrokona in the northwestern region, as well as the hilly districts near Cox’s Bazaar, Banderban, Khagrachhari and Rangamati in the southeast (bordering Myanmar). Reliable figures for the total area of cannabis production in Bangladesh are not available, but cultivation in the Chittagong Hill Tract region is reportedly on the increase. The army and the Border Guard Bangladesh in the southeastern hilly region have reported that the overall cannabis production has increased significantly in recent years. Manufacture Bangladesh is not believed to manufacture any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances illicitly. It also does not manufacture any precursor chemicals except hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid. Trafficking Bangladesh is a transit country for drugs produced in the Golden Triangle and, to a much lesser degree, Key Facts Consumption of both opium and cannabis are traditional in Bangladesh. Other drugs such as heroin began to be smuggled into the country only in the 1980s. The smuggling, diversion and abuse of pharmaceuticals originating from India is considered the single largest drug problem in Bangladesh. Commonly abused pharmaceuticals are Phensidyl® (a codeine-based cough syrup), Tidigesic® (buprenorphine) and pethidine injections. There are approximately 20,000 -25,000 IDUs in the country. The most commonly injected drug is buprenorphine (commonly known by the trade name1 Tidigesic®). Poly drug use is common. Bangladesh is considered a “low prevalence, high risk situation” for HIV/AIDS. However, recent trends indicate that in certain areas the HIV/AIDS prevalence among IDUs may be approaching the concentrated epidemic mark (5%). According to research, certain outreach interventions have been effective in reducing the size of the sharing group (of needles and syringes) among IDUs. In areas where such interventions occurred, 25% of IDUs shared with three persons or more against a much higher 40% in areas where no outreach programme existed. In contrast to 87% of the current IDUs from intervention sites, only 66% of IDUs in districts without outreach interventions knew that syringe and needles sharing could spread HIV. Recently, a new heroin trafficking route has opened up from the north central states of India eastwards into Bangladesh. A portion of this product is consumed in Bangladesh while some is destined for overseas. Bangladesh is a source country for women and children being trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation, involuntary domestic servitude and debt bondage. The estimated number of women and girls trafficked annually out of the country is 10,000 – 20,000. Some reports indicate that 40,000 children from Bangladesh are involved in prostitution in Pakistan. There is also significant internal movement within the country to urban centres for the same purposes. the Golden Crescent. Reports from the Indian Narcotics Control Bureau also indicate that heroin is smuggled from India to Bangladesh through the porous Indo-Bangladesh border. Nonetheless, the smuggling in, diversion and abuse of pharmaceuticals originating from India is considered to be the largest drug problem in Bangladesh. Commonly abused pharmaceuticals are Phensidyl® (a codeine-based cough syrup), Tidigesic® (buprenorphine) and pethidine injections. Demand Bangladesh has clearly moved from being a transit country to one where so-called ‘hard’ drugs are used. The number of drug users is increasing in both urban and rural areas. The number of injecting drug users (IDUs) is also on the rise, with the majority using buprenorphine. The drug most frequently used by drug-dependent persons reporting to treatment centres is heroin. Phensidyl®, a codeine-based cough syrup imported from India, is generally considered to be the most widely abused drug. There are approximately 20,000 25,000 IDUs in the country (Reid and Costigan 2002). The most commonly injected drug is buprenorphine (commonly known by the trade name Tidigesic®). Polydrug use is common and may include marijuana, Tidigesic®, Phensidyl®, alcohol, codeine, nitrazepam, ‘brown sugar’ (heroin ‘cooked’ with vitamin C) and diazepam. A survey included a collection of both secondary as well as primary data, which comprised of observations, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and interviews with drug users. In most districts both heroin smokers and drug injectors were found. Ten percent of all drug users who reported ever having smoked heroin started doing so at the age of 17 or earlier. Three percent of all injectors started injecting before the age of 18 years. The mean age of onset for heroin smoking was 24 years, while the mean age of onset for IDU was 28 years. The dynamics of switching to injecting from heroin smoking were also studied and the finding that 87% of current IDUs had once been heroin smokers and many drug users went back and forth from one type of drug use to another, suggests that the drug use pattern keeps changing. More than 25% of IDUs in districts with outreach interventions, 99% of IDUs in districts without outreach interventions and 99% of all heroin smokers in all districts were not in contact with any outreach programme. The study also reported that a spillover of illicit drugs occurs around the drug trafficking network. Trafficking and drug Bangladesh possesses laws to prevent trafficking. Some social services are provided for trafficking victims. In early 2004, the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs attempted to raise awareness on the issue of human trafficking. In 2003, it established ‘one-stop’ crisis centres in two hospitals for female victims of violence and human trafficking. Legislation The Narcotics Control Act of 1990 (Act Number XX of 1990) covers the control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including provision for the treatment and rehabilitation of drug dependent people. Bangladesh has amended the narcotics act and allows the Director General of the Department of Narcotics Control to send drug addicts for treatment. Drug use is considered a treatable condition rather than a criminal offence. Policy – Crime The constitution of Bangladesh provides “to enjoy the protection of the law and to be treated in accordance with law, is an undeniable right of every citizen, wherever he may be, and of every other person for the time being in Bangladesh, and in particular no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law”. The constitution further provides that “every person accused of a criminal offence shall have the right to a speedy and public trial by an independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law”.

The G-Finder report found that money invested in research and development reached $3.5bn (£2.8bn) in 2017. The total is a 7% increase on the previous year. But the group which tracked the data warned that this area of global health was still too reliant on a handful of top funders. The largest funder was the US government, which through its National Institutes of Health provided 39% of the total. There were significant increases in contributions from the UK, the European Commission (EC), Germany and India. The total investment was the largest seen since 2009. A small Australian not-for-profit organisation called Policy Cures Research has been paid by the Gates Foundation to monitor how new health technologies are funded. Its work looks at what drug companies, universities, governments and non-governmental organisations spend on detecting, treating or preventing big killer diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (TB). Research and development grants helping lesser-known illnesses - such as diarrhoeal diseases, dengue and leprosy - are also included. Fascinating and scary The UKs funding increased by a huge 89% - representing an extra $87m (£67m) - in the latest year tracked. This was because of extra money from the Department for International Development, but almost half of the increase was because of a new funding stream from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). The DHSC money went to researchers looking at new drugs to treat malaria and TB, and a European partnership bringing together clinical trials which help developing countries. Anna Doubell, Policy Cures Researchs director of research, said: ""The UK increase has been fantastic to see. ""Brexit raises a big question about what might change - we will only find out in time. ""And despite the record high in funding, no country reached the World Health Organization target for member states to spend 0.01% of their GDP on research into the health needs of developing countries.""

""I would hope that tidal volume doesnt come under threat. We have seen a real and strong commitment. ""Its a fascinating and scary time."" He added: ""There are holes in our data regarding contributions from Russia and China.

Tuberculosis is a communicable disease caused by an organism called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This organism is also called as tubercle bacilli. Usually they affect the lungs. How does TB spread? When a person with pulmonary TB coughs, sneezes, laughs, or talks tubercle bacilli are spread into the air in tiny droplets. People who are in close contact can breathe in these droplets and become infected. What is a case of TB? A patient in whom TB has been bacteriologically confirmed or diagnosed by a clinician. What types of TB are there? There are two types of 18 (according to organ/parts of the body affected) Pulmonary TB- when tuberculosis occurs in the lungs then it is called as pulmonary TB. Extra-Pulmonary TB- if TB affects organs other than lungs (such as lymph nodes, bones and joints, genitourinary tract, meninges, pleura, intestines etc.) it is called as Extra Pulmonary TB. What are the symptoms of Pulmonary TB? Symptoms of pulmonary TB include: Cough more than two weeks Chest pain Low grade fever, especially in the evening. Loss of weight Loss of appetite Blood stained sputum Who is vulnerable to TB? Following individuals are at risk of contracting infection and developing the disease because of their exposure to a patient with TB. Family and close contacts of the patients The elderly People with low income People with poor access to health care People who inject illicit drugs People who live or work in certain setting, such as nursing homes, prisons, shelters for the homeless or 18 treatment centres People with HIV infection People addicted to alcohol Malnourished people People with poorly controlled Diabetes People having chronic lung diseases Smokers People suffering from cancers How is TB detected? Pulmonary TB can be detected by sputum examination. Chest X-ray also helps in detection of TB of the lungs. At present, bacterial examination of sputum is the best method of diagnosis of pulmonary TB. The smear microscopy is better method of diagnosis than X-ray because it is simple, easy to perform; less expensive and reliable. Impact of HIV/AIDS on TB HIV infection increases susceptibility to TB. A person with HIV infection is up to 30-50 times more likely to develop active TB than a person with a healthy immune system. Consequences of this epidemic of TB/HIV co-infection on national TB programme are increased caseloads, low TB cure rates, high case fatality rates during treatment, under diagnosis of TB, the potential of high default rates and the accelerated emergence of drug resistant TB. Hence, early detection of TB & HIV, treatment of TB under DOTS, prevention of HIV & care of AIDS cases are vital in the management of the dual epidemics. How is TB disease treated? Tuberculosis is a curable disease and treated with the oral drugs sometimes together with injections. TB drugs are available at free of cost in all government health facilities. The total duration of treatment is 6 to 8 months. Treatment should not be discontinued before completion of full course. If treatment is interrupted before completion of full course the drug resistance will develop which is dangerous to patient as well as to the community. Drug resistance TB is difficult to treat. Available effective anti-TB drugs: Following are the main anti - TB drugs available everywhere. (in all TB treatment Centres) Isoniazid (INH) Rifampicin ( RFP) Pyrazinamid (PZA) Oral Drugs Ethambutol (EB) Streptomycin (SM) - Injection What are the adverse effects of anti- TB drugs? Drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis may sometimes cause side effects/adverse effects, such as Anorexia, Nausea, Abdominal Pain, Joint Pains, etc. These may cause the patients to stop taking medicines. Most TB patients complete their treatment without any significant adverse effects of drugs. However, a few patients do experience adverse effects. It is therefore important that patients be clinically monitored during treatment so that adverse effects can be detected promptly and managed properly. Health personnel can monitor adverse effects of drugs by teaching patients how to recognize symptoms of common adverse effects. How one can help TB patients understand more about their disease? Patients are more likely to successfully complete their treatment if they understand about their disease and treatment. Patients are often afraid when they learn of their diagnosis, because they harbor misbelieves such as TB is an incurable disease. Reassure them and provide them with proper and relevant information; TB is a curable disease and it not a hereditary disease. TB is caused by an organism/bacillus TB spreads by air through coughing, sneezing, laughing, talking loudly. Investigation of TB suspects and treatment of TB cases are free of cost. If there is a side effect, inform Health workers as soon as possible. Talking to an individual patient or patients in groups and distribution of pamphlets and brochures containing basic TB information, should help to improve the patients knowledge on TB. What is Drug Resistance? Drug resistant bacilli are the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli, which are resistant to anti-tuberculosis drug and Multi-Drug resistant (MDR) bacilli are the bacilli that are resistant to more than one anti-tuberculosis drugs, specially the two main drugs- Isoniazid and Rifampicin. MDR is currently the most severe form of bacterial resistance. How is MDR TB produced? As with other forms of drug resistance, the phenomenon of MDR tuberculosis is entirely man-made. Drug resistant bacilli are the consequences of human error in any of the followings: What is DOTS? DOTS stands for Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course, and it is the proven cost-effective strategy to control TB by giving drugs to patients under direct observation of health workers/treatment supporter DOTS has been found 100% effective to cure T8 and to prevent multi-drug resistance. Only DOTS ensures cure of diagnosed TB patients. It can also prevent relapse and death. What are the essential elements of DOTS strategy? Government commitment to sustain TB control Sputum smear microscopy to detect the infectious cases among those people attending health care facilities with symptoms of pulmonary TB. Standardized short-course anti- TB treatment with direct observation. Uninterrupted supply of anti-TB drugs and diagnostics, and Monitoring and accountability. What is the evidence that DOTS works? In areas where DOTS was implemented, cure rates of up to 95% have been recorded, even in very poor countries. More over DOTS prevents transmission of new infections and the development of multi-drug resistant 18. The DOTS strategy has been ranked by the World Bank as one of the most cost- effective of all health interventions. DOTS success stories in SAARC The following are some of the success stories in the SAARC region: Bangladesh adopted the DOTS strategy in 1993. Currently, it is being implemented in over 95% of the country. By 2001, as many as 80% of the patients receiving treatment were cured in areas of the country where the strategy was being used. In 1997, WHO described Bangladeshs TB control programme as a model for the entire world. Bhutan has achieved complete population coverage; improving the delivery of ambulatory DOTS in the difficult terrain is under way. Maldives achieved and has maintained global targets since 1995. Nepal has implemented DOTS successfully and achieved these targets in mid-2002. More than 89% of patients in DOTS sites have been cured compared to less than 50% before the DOTS strategy was adopted. What are the benefits of DOTS? The benefits for patients themselves are the increasing treatment completion resulting in rapid cure. Furthermore, case management under DOTS strategy can prevent death, sequel & relapse. Moreover, DOTS can reduce community transmission of tubercle bacilli as well as emergence of drug resistance strains. DOTS can: Prolong life and improve its quality Stop the spread of TB Prevent emergence of multi-drug resistance TB Reverse the trend of multi-drug resistance TB.",{},"['dots', 'resistant', 'drugs', 'tb', 'general', 'health', 'pulmonary', 'patients', 'treatment', 'information', 'resistance', 'bacilli']","There are two types of 18 (according to organ/parts of the body affected)Pulmonary TB- when tuberculosis occurs in the lungs then it is called as pulmonary TB.

During the 1970s and 80s I spent a lot of time with women in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Fear of death in childbirth, child marriage, family violence, pain, poverty and resignation were common themes. Health information and services were woefully inadequate. I chose to work in family planning because it is a vital reproductive health resource and the only one that was available to poor women in developing countries. Why were reproductive health services so poor in developing countries back then? Governments did not feel that reproductive health other than family planning was worth investing in. Data about women’s reproductive health were sparse and maternal deaths were estimated, not counted, while morbidity was ignored. This neglect was based on the argument that preventing pregnancy was a better way to prevent these deaths than providing obstetric services. Sexually transmitted infections in females and induced abortion were subjects people refused to deal with, even though abortion, nearly always unsafe or fatal, was being used as a means of birth control. This was evident from the few statistics that were available and from my experience working with these women. Can you recall an incident that illustrates the consequences of this neglect? Women’s health activist Adrienne Germain talks to Sarah Cumberland about the revolution that has changed the world’s approach to reproductive health. One strong image illustrates the lack of services and basic human rights for women who had abortions. In Cameroon I visited a sparkling new maternity hospital on a hill. Down below, in what was often a sea of red mud, was a dilapidated building where women with complications of “backyard” abortions were often left lying by the door by family members too ashamed to be seen with them. Only one doctor worked there, in terrible conditions with almost no equipment or drugs. The women were put on rusty gurneys with a dirty sheet and, after treatment, housed in “rooms” the size of closets, each with three tiers of wooden shelves, not beds. In one I saw one woman, “Rose"", dying. The fancy maternity hospital on the hill could have saved her but refused to serve women who had had unsafe abortions. In Asia in the 1970s, many countries had strong population control programmes that provided family planning services. Didn’t women in these countries receive better care than women in countries where contraception was not supported by the government? While contraception was an essential and desired service, too little attention was given to service quality because the goal was to promote acceptance of contraceptives. In India, for example, a lot of intrauterine devices (IUDs) inserted during periodic “camps” were not fitted properly and led to unwanted pregnancies. The women involved often ended up having unsafe abortions because abortions were rarely available in health-care facilities, especially in rural areas, even though it had been legalized in 1972 for pregnancies up to 10 weeks. This is still the case in rural areas. Although abortion services are now more widely available in urban areas, especially from private, for-profit providers, low-income urban women must still resort to unsafe procedures. IUDs remain unpopular in India. Other contraceptive choices were very limited and services then, as now, were often poor, yet women were blamed for not wanting to use them. In Indonesia, contraceptive services were often delivered to villages by the military. Women were given no choice in contraception-related matters; they were not offered support or information on dealing with its side-effects or guidance in choosing alternative methods. Again, the drive to increase acceptors trumped interest in service quality. During the late 1980s, you witnessed a feminist revolution that differed from one in high-income countries during the 1960s and 1970s. What were these activists fighting for? A: This movement in developing countries had its roots in the fight for broader social justice. Many of the leaders had developed their political skills fighting against military dictatorships in Latin America or trying to eradicate poverty in Asia. They wanted women to be treated as human beings with sexual and reproductive rights. They knew that protecting these rights had to go hand in hand with work towards achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment. They called for a change to the existing policy paradigm, from one centred on controlling population growth to policies centred on sexual reproductive health and rights from the perspective of the women themselves. The United Nations International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in 1994, changed governments’ approaches to population and development. What did you and other activists at the conference ask governments to do? A: We called for good quality comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, including contraception, safe abortion, maternity care, and diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, bolstered by comprehensive sexuality education and protection of human rights. We also called for better access to women’s health services. Ultimately, the core tenets of this platform, which became known as “Reproductive health and justice: the Rio Statement” (because it was developed at a meeting in Rio), were adopted by 179 governments at the Cairo conference. Can you give an example of a country that changed its national policy to reflect a rights-based approach to reproductive health? Bangladesh has had a very strong family planning programme in place since the early 1970s. Following the Cairo conference, the International Womens Health Coalition worked with government, civil society and donors to add obstetric services to the existing contraceptive and menstrual regulation services. Programmes were initiated for prevention of sexually transmitted infections including HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], reproductive health education for young people, and contraceptive information for newlyweds. Five years after the new National Health and Population Programme started in 1998, maternal deaths had fallen by nearly 25%. By 2008, they were down 40%. What will help to bring about change in countries? A: A demand from the countries themselves will help bring about integrated sexual and reproductive health services, comprehensive sexuality education and protection of sexual and reproductive rights. Fortunately, a younger generation of activists with their own visions and skills is emerging. They are committed to action in their countries but need more support. The world should support these young people and foster their leaders. As a member of the Global Task Force on Women and HIV and AIDS, what challenges did you want to see addressed? Despite all the attention and resources invested in HIV and AIDS, little progress has been made on integrating HIV services with other sexual and reproductive health services for women and girls. This failure, whose severe consequences for women and children are known, motivated us to seek a paradigm shift in HIV policy. Again, we face a major political and practical challenge that involves making everyone, from researchers to advocates, understand that women’s vulnerability to HIV stems primarily from our failure to protect their sexual and reproductive rights. Further, living with HIV is dramatically more difficult when services are not integrated. We’ve made the case over and over again: HIV belongs with sexual and reproductive health and rights. Finally, in December 2009 a global agenda for accelerated action for women and girls in the context of HIV was approved with sexual and reproductive rights at its core. However, much remains to be done at both national and international levels to transform this agenda into concrete, fully funded programmes. Why the widespread resistance to integrating HIV and reproductive health services? There are many reasons, including disease control models that emphasize risk, not vulnerability; competition for scarce resources; narrow disciplinary training that encourage health professionals to work separately rather than collaborate across subjects and services; and gender bias among others. Research shows that women’s health has definitely suffered from the separation of HIV information and services from other components of sexual and reproductive health care. A clear example is the inability of most HIV services in sub-Saharan Africa to provide contraceptives, safe abortion, treatment and referral following sexual coercion or violence, or human papillomavirus (HPV) screening to women living with HIV. When people have to go to different places on different days to get different services, many can’t or won’t do so for good reasons and we lose opportunities to educate and to provide preventive services. What sort of hope do you hold for women’s health? In 40 years I have never seen as strong a commitment to women’s health as we have right now at the global level. The United Nations Secretary-General and the President of the United States have both announced important initiatives for women’s health. We’ve never before had such leadership. These major global health initiatives – the United Nations Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health and the United States Government’s Global Health Initiative – are highly conducive to progress. Their political weight bolsters other global initiatives and donors to finance and strengthen health systems with an emphasis on women and children. The UNFPA has new leadership and a revised strategic plan that focuses on integrated sexual and reproductive health services, as well as adolescent health and development, reinforced by promotion of gender equality and human rights. Many of the leaders behind these major global efforts are men. As more men in positions of importance (including ministers of finance) speak out and act, especially at the national level, progress will be faster. Making political commitments is all very well but are politicians actually delivering? The rhetoric has improved, but most politicians act only in their interests and/or when they are pressed to do so. In most countries, women and children don’t have a strong political voice, although in some they have gained considerable ground over the last decade or so. Health professionals have been less supportive than they should be and need to be educated about how the sexual and reproductive rights and health services approach will help them achieve their own goals. We must promote and applaud global champions such as those I’ve mentioned, as well as highly experienced and effective policy-makers and programme managers from countries that are making progress. We must invest in both local and international advocates whose main task today is to persuade those with power and resources to transform their rhetoric into action.",{},"['sexual', 'countries', 'hiv', 'services', 'control', 'women', 'human', 'womens', 'health', 'reproductive', 'rights', 'population', 'global']","Data about women’s reproductive health were sparse and maternal deaths were estimated, not counted, while morbidity was ignored.

Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this are the right of men and women to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of fertility regulation of their choice, and the right of access to appropriate health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. Sexually transmitted infections Infections and transmission Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are spread primarily through person-to-person sexual contact. There are more than 30 different sexually transmissible bacteria, viruses and parasites. Several, in particular HIV and syphilis, can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth, and through blood products and tissue transfer. Some of the commonest sexually transmitted pathogens can be divided into those caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites. Common bacterial infections Neisseria gonorrhoeae (causes gonorrhoea or gonococcal infection) Chlamydia trachomatis (causes chlamydial infections) Treponema pallidum (causes syphilis) Haemophilus ducreyi (causes chancroid) Klebsiella granulomatis (previously known as Calymmatobacterium granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale or donovanosis). Common viral infections Human immunodeficiency virus (causes AIDS) Herpes simplex virus type 2 (causes genital herpes) Human papillomavirus (causes genital warts and certain subtypes lead to cervical cancer in women) Hepatitis B virus (causes hepatitis and chronic cases may lead to cancer of the liver) Cytomegalovirus (causes inflammation in a number of organs including the brain, the eye, and the bowel). Parasitic organisms Trichomonas vaginalis (causes vaginal trichomoniasis) Candida albicans (causes vulvovaginitis in women; inflammation of the glans penis and foreskin [balano-posthitis] in men). Sexually transmitted infections (stis) are a public health issue According to 1999 WHO estimates, 340 million new cases of curable STIs (syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis) occur annually throughout the world in adults aged 15-49 years. In developing countries, STIs and their complications rank in the top five disease categories for which adults seek health care. Infection with STIs can lead to acute symptoms, chronic infection and serious delayed consequences such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, cervical cancer and the untimely death of infants and adults. STIs and prevention of serious complications in women STIs are the main preventable cause of infertility, particularly in women. Between 10% and 40% of women with untreated chlamydial infection develop symptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease. Post-infection tubal damage is responsible for 30% to 40% of cases of female infertility. Furthermore, women who have had pelvic inflammatory disease are 6 to 10 times more likely to develop an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy than those who have not, and 40% to 50% of ectopic pregnancies can be attributed to previous pelvic inflammatory disease. Infection with certain types of the human papillomavirus can lead to the development of genital cancers, particularly cervical cancer in women. STIs and adverse outcomes of pregnancy Untreated sexually transmitted infections are associated with congenital and perinatal infections in neonates, particularly in the areas where rates of infection remain high. In pregnant women with untreated early syphilis, 25% of pregnancies result in stillbirth and 14% in neonatal death – an overall perinatal mortality of about 40%. Syphilis prevalence in pregnant women in Africa, for example, ranges from 4% to 15%. Up to 35% of pregnancies among women with untreated gonococcal infection result in spontaneous abortions and premature deliveries, and up to 10% in perinatal deaths. In the absence of prophylaxis, 30% to 50% of infants born to mothers with untreated gonorrhoea and up to 30% of infants born to mothers with untreated chlamydial infection will develop a serious eye infection (ophthalmia neonatorum), which can lead to blindness if not treated early. It is estimated that, worldwide, between 1000 and 4000 newborn babies become blind every year because of this condition. STIs and HIV The presence of an untreated ulcerative or non-ulcerative (those STIs which cause ulcers or those which do not) infection increases the risk of both acquisition and transmission of HIV by a factor of up to 10. Thus, prompt treatment for STIs is important to reduce the risk of HIV infection. Controlling STIs is important for preventing HIV in people at high risk, as well as in the general population. Prevention of STIs The most effective means to avoid becoming infected with or transmitting a sexually transmitted infection is to abstain from sexual intercourse (i.e., oral, vaginal, or anal sex) or to have sexual intercourse only within a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner. Male latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in reducing the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis. STIs without symptoms Some sexually transmitted infections often exist without symptoms. For example, up to 70% of women and a significant proportion of men with gonococcal and/or chlamydial infections may experience no symptoms at all. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections can lead to the development of serious complications, as outline above. STI syndromes and the syndromic approach to patient management Although many different pathogens cause STIs, some of them give rise to similar or overlapping clinical appearances, known as signs (what the individual or the health-care provider sees on examination) and symptoms (what the patient feels, such as pain or irritation). Some of these signs and symptoms are easily recognizable and consistent, giving what is known as a syndrome that signals the presence of one or a number of pathogens. For example, a discharge from the urethra in men can be caused by gonorrhoea alone, chlamydia alone or both together. The main syndromes of common STIs are: Urethral discharge Genital ulcers Inguinal swellings (bubo, which is a swelling in the groin) Scrotal swelling Vaginal discharge Lower abdominal pain Neonatal eye infections (conjunctivitis of the newborn) The traditional method of diagnosing STIs is by laboratory tests. However, these are often unavailable or too expensive. Since 1990 WHO has recommended a syndromic approach to diagnosis and management of STIs in patients presenting with consistently recognized signs and symptoms of particular STIs. The syndromic approach is a scientifically derived approach and offers accessible and immediate treatment that is effective. The syndromic approach using flowcharts to guide diagnosis and treatment is more accurate than diagnosis based on clinical judgment alone, even in experienced hands, and more cost-effective for some syndromes than use of laboratory tests. However, the specificity of this approach for vaginal discharge is low for gonorrhoea and chlamydia and treating all women with vaginal discharge for cervical infection (as if they have a sexually transmitted cause for the discharge) has led to unacceptable levels of over-treatment in some settings. Women with abnormal vaginal discharge should be treated primarily for vaginal infections, and treatment for gonorrhoea and chlamydia only included according to the prevalence of or risk for these pathogens. The organisms causing any particular syndrome need to be determined locally and flow charts adapted accordingly. Furthermore, regular monitoring of the organisms causing each syndrome should be conducted on a regular basis to validate the treatment recommendations. the global strategy for the prevention and control of STIs The control of STIs remains a priority for WHO. The World Health Assembly endorsed the global strategy for the prevention and control of STIs in May 2006. The strategy urges all countries to control the transmission of STIs by implementing a number of interventions, including the following: 1. Prevention by promoting safer sexual behaviours; 2. General access to quality condoms at affordable prices; 3. Promotion of early recourse to health services by people suffering from STIs and by their partners; 4. Inclusion of STI treatment in basic health services; 5. Specific services for populations with frequent or unplanned high-risk sexual behaviours - such as sex workers, adolescents, long-distance truck-drivers, military personnel, substance users and prisoners; 6. Proper treatment of STIs, i.e. use of correct and effective medicines, treatment of sexual partners, education and advice; 7. Screening of clinically asymptomatic patients, where feasible; (e.g. syphilis, chlamydia); 8. Provision for counselling and voluntary testing for HIV infection; 9. Prevention and care of congenital syphilis and neonatal conjunctivitis; and 10. Involvement of all relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and the community, in prevention and care of STIs. Emergency contraception Emergency contraception refers to back-up methods for contraceptive emergencies which women can use within the first few days after unprotected intercourse to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. Emergency contraceptives are not suitable for regular use. The WHO-recommended regimen for emergency contraception is: 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel as a single dose. WHO needs emergency contraception? Any woman of reproductive age may need emergency contraception at some point to avoid an unwanted pregnancy. It is meant to be used in situations such as: when no contraceptive has been used; when there is a contraceptive failure or incorrect use, including: condom breakage, slippage, or incorrect use three or more consecutive missed combined oral contraceptive pills progestogen-only pill (minipill) taken more than three hours late more than two weeks late for a progestogen-only contraceptive injection (depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone enanthate) more than seven days late for a combined estrogen-plus-progestogen monthly injection dislodgment, breakage, tearing, or early removal of a diaphragm or cervical capdislodgment, delay in placing, or early removal of a contraceptive hormonal skin patch or ring failed coitus interruptus (e.g., ejaculation in vagina or on external genitalia) failure of a spermicide tablet or film to melt before intercourse miscalculation of the periodic abstinence method or failure to abstain on fertile day of cycle IUD expulsion; in cases of sexual assault when the woman was not protected by an effective contraceptive method. Mode of action Levonorgestrel emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) have been shown to prevent ovulation and they did not have any detectable effect on the endometrium (uterine lining) or progesterone levels when given after ovulation. ECPs are not effective once the process of implantation has begun, and will not cause abortion. Effectiveness Based on reports from four studies including almost 5000 women, the levonorgestrel regimen used within five days after unprotected intercourse reduced a womans chance of pregnancy by 60-90 per cent. The regimen is more effective the sooner after intercourse it is taken. Medical eligibility criteria Emergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy. They should not be given to a woman who already has a confirmed pregnancy. However, if a woman inadvertently takes the pills after she became pregnant, the limited available evidence suggests that the pills will not harm either the mother or her fetus. Emergency contraceptive pills are for emergency use only and not appropriate for regular use as an ongoing contraceptive method because of the higher possibility of failure compared to modern contraceptives. In addition, frequent use of emergency contraception would results in more side-effects, such as menstrual irregularities. However, their repeated use poses no known health risks.

Chief Health Officer of Rajshahi City Corporation Dr AFM Anjuman Ara Begum and Senior Health Education Officer Sazzad Hossain addressed the discussion as the chief and special guests respectively with Mostofa Sarker, President of Bachar Alo Sangskritic Sangstha, in the chair. Social Service Officer Abdullah Al Faruque, District Cultural Officer Faruqur Rahman and project coordinator of Sonali Din Manob Kolyan Sangstha Azizur Rahman also spoke. During his concept paper presentation, Mofazzal Hossain, Coordinator of SEED Grant Project, mentioned that the members of transgender community are subjected to negligence and repression in every sphere of life including family and society. The hijra community is essentially deprived of several rights under the countrys existing law, because it recognises only two sexes, male and female. Time has come to promoting and protecting fundamental rights of the extreme socially excluded people.

Skin changes may also indicate the presence of more serious diseases that need treatment. In the past, such conditions were ignored or given low priority by health authorities because they did not, on the whole, kill people, and they often did not present in tertiary care centres. But now there is a big push at both national and international levels to train health workers in developing countries to improve diagnosis and treatment of dermatological conditions. Professor Rod Hay, Head of the School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen’s University Belfast, said the change is very welcome. Hay is Chair of the International Foundation for Dermatology, a non-profit organization based in Chicago, the United States, linked to the International League of Dermatological Societies, that aims to improve dermatological care in developing countries. He said: “There is better recognition of the extent of the problem, helped by the fact that the first signs of certain diseases, including HIV/AIDS, leprosy and onchocerciasis, tend to appear as skin problems.” Dr José Figueroa-Munoz, who is currently a medical officer in WHO’s Stop TB Department but was previously a fellow of the St John’s Institute of Dermatology in London, United Kingdom, agreed that there is now better acknowledgement of skin diseases and the impact they have. “Most of these diseases have always been there, and in many cases they are so common that they are part of the local culture,” Figueroa-Munoz said. “But there is now more realization that even though many people do not see these diseases as a problem, they could still be having an important impact on general health.” For example, skin diseases that countries, many of them fostered by the International Foundation for Dermatology. At the international level, recognition of the problem is continuing to grow: Hay points out that the Disease Control Priorities Project of the World Bank/WHO/Fogarty International Center is due to publish its second report this month, which includes a chapter on the priorities relating to skin diseases in developing countries. At a workshop in September 2004 organized by the International Foundation for Dermatology, Hay made the case that it was time to strengthen community dermatology programmes for developing countries. Many skin conditions are due to infections, he concluded, and could be treated with simple remedies if these were used in the right way. Poor training is one factor contributing to the huge amount of time and resources being poured into treating skin disease badly, he said. Delegates attending the workshop identified several areas for action. First, they called for more up-to-date evidence on common treatments for scabies that can be adopted by whole communities. Second, because antiretrovirals are now more commonly available in developing countries for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, they wanted a simple diagnostic scheme that would allow health-care staff to recognize people who were potentially infected with HIV from changes in their skin or mucosal surfaces. Their third recommendation was for better training for health-care staff on treatment of common skin conditions, such as pyoderma, ringworm, tropical ulcer, infected sores and diabetic foot. Finally, the delegates called for better promotion of existing examples of good practice that could be rolled out to other communities. Hay said one example of good practice that could be usefully transferred to other settings is provided by the Regional Dermatology Training Centre (RDTC) in Moshi, the United Republic of Tanzania, which the International Foundation of Dermatology established, in collaboration with the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania, in 1997. The centre provides training for primary care doctors from across Africa, who can return to their own countries and train others. The International Foundation of Dermatology, which will be based in London from January 2006, has helped with similar projects, based on a short-course educational model, in the state of Guerrero, Mexico, and in Mali. Figueroa-Munoz also calls for better training — and especially for evaluation of training projects — in order to establish that these are having the desired impact on those people most in need. “There is a desperate need for operational research to evaluate interventions to find out what works best,” he said. One problem already identified, and which is not exclusive to dermatology, is the risk that doctors sent to Europe or the United States to undergo training will never return to their home countries. “It may be better for training to be undertaken locally,” Figueroa-Munoz said. “This is particularly important in dermatology, as the trainer needs to understand the conditions under which people are going to work. Secondly, the presentation of dermatological conditions varies according to the type of skin. It can be very difficult to obtain photographs for training that feature these conditions on people with the same type of skin as occurs locally.” Some successful projects have focused on individual dermatological problems. For example, the RDTC in the United Republic of Tanzania has developed a treatment and prevention programme for skin cancer in albinos. A recent survey by the RDTC in the Kilimanjaro area, where about 1 million people live, showed that at least 15 000 are albinos and therefore at risk of dying from skin cancer in their teens. In the Northern Territory of Australia, studies on the indigenous population have shown that children who caught scabies, and were therefore at risk of secondary bacterial infection, were more likely to show signs of kidney damage several years later — the result of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. “There is now a well-organized public health programme to ensure that children with scabies are identified early and treated,” Hay said. Other issues that have the potential to be addressed locally through education or improved management include, he said, the problem of actinic dermatitis (a type of photosensitivity dermatitis) in rural indigenous populations in Mexico and Latin America; and the use of skin bleaching agents, which results in scarring. The latter, Hay said, is a “huge problem” in Africa, where women use such creams to lighten their skin. According to the forthcoming chapter in the Disease Control Priorities Project report, the skin conditions that comprise most of the cases presenting in the community are: scabies, pyoderma, fungal infections, tropical ulcer, AIDS-related dermatoses and pigmentary disorders. Focusing on these conditions could significantly reduce the burden of skin disease in developing countries, the paper concludes. Hay agreed. He said: “The core to tackling these problems is proper training at primary care level. Many of these conditions have comparatively simple treatments, and these are often not that expensive. Treatment will confer significant gains to both personal and public health.”",{},"['countries', 'awareness', 'problem', 'growing', 'skin', 'conditions', 'flurry', 'disease', 'training', 'developing', 'diseases', 'initiatives', 'international', 'starts', 'dermatology', 'united']","Skin diseases in developing countries have a serious impact on people’s quality of life, causing lost productivity at work and school, and discrimination due to disfigurement.

Lots of things can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty, and sore. But dry eyes can also be related to a medical condition that affects your immune system like diabetes, lupus, or HIV. And sometimes dry eyes are the first sign of a deeper problem. Inflammation can be a root cause There are more than 80 autoimmune diseases. Theyre called that because your immune system attacks your healthy tissue by mistake instead of invading germs and viruses. One thing all these diseases have in common is inflammation, which can lead to pain, swelling, and other trouble. This inflammation can show up almost anywhere in your body. Sometimes thats far away from a diseases main target of, for example, your skin or your joints. Inflammation can damage your tear glands, so they dont make enough fluid. Or it can target oil glands in your eyelids; without oil, your tears evaporate too soon. Either way, your eyes get dry. Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Most people with diabetes know that it can cause eye problems like retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Yet about half of all people with diabetes have dry eyes, and many dont know it. Thats because the nerve damage that causes you to lose feeling in your hands, legs, and feet -- so you dont notice cuts and sores -- can also affect your eyes. Severe dryness thats not treated can damage your cornea, the dome that covers the front part of your eye. If you have diabetes, get your eyes checked regularly, perhaps every year, including the corneas. If you dont have it and you have dry eyes, especially if your vision is blurry and youre often thirsty, too, you may want to get tested for diabetes. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) This type of arthritis can target almost any part of your body, including your eyes. Some people with RA have a second autoimmune disease called Sjogrens syndrome, which dries out both your eyes and mouth. Lupus Having lupus makes you more likely to get many eye problems, but the most common is dry eye. Inflammation damages your tear-making glands, so they cant make enough moisture to keep your eyes healthy. Graves Disease The inflammation with this thyroid disease pulls and stretches the muscles around your eyes, so they bulge out a bit. When you cant shut your eyes tight, your tears will evaporate too fast. Treatment How autoimmune problems are treated depends on the disease, but keeping inflammation under control is key. If you have very dry eyes, you may need short-term prescription eye drops, too.",{},"['disorders', 'dont', 'diabetes', 'immune', 'glands', 'problems', 'target', 'inflammation', 'dry', 'eye', 'diseases', 'eyes']","But dry eyes can also be related to a medical condition that affects your immune system like diabetes, lupus, or HIV.

WHO on oral health,,,,,"WHO on oral health WHO Key facts • Worldwide, 60–90% of school children and nearly 100% of adults have dental cavities. • Dental cavities can be prevented by maintaining a constant low level of fluoride in the oral cavity. • Severe periodontal (gum) disease, which may result in tooth loss, is found in 15–20% of middle-aged (35-44 years) adults. • Globally, about 30% of people aged 65–74 have no natural teeth. • Oral disease in children and adults is higher among poor and disadvantaged population groups. • Risk factors for oral diseases include an unhealthy diet, tobacco use, harmful alcohol use and poor oral hygiene, and social determinants. Oral health is essential to general health and quality of life. It is a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual’s capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing. Oral diseases and conditions The most common oral diseases are dental cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, oral cancer, oral infectious diseases, trauma from injuries, and hereditary lesions. Dental cavities Worldwide, 60–90% of school children and nearly 100% of adults have dental cavities, often leading to pain and discomfort. Periodontal disease Severe periodontal (gum) disease, which may result in tooth loss, is found in 15–20% of middle-aged (35-44 years) adults. Tooth loss Dental cavities and periodontal disease are major causes of tooth loss. Complete loss of natural teeth is widespread and particularly affects older people. Globally, about 30% of people aged 65–74 have no natural teeth. Oral cancer The incidence of oral cancer ranges from one to 10 cases per 100 000 people in most countries. The prevalence of oral cancer is relatively higher in men, in older people, and among people of low education and low income. Tobacco and alcohol are major causal factors. Fungal, bacterial or viral infections in HIV Almost half (40–50%) of people who are HIV-positive have oral fungal, bacterial or viral infections. These often occur early in the course of HIV infection. Oro-dental trauma Across the world, 16-40% of children in the age range 6 to12 years old are affected by dental trauma due to unsafe playgrounds, unsafe schools, road accidents, or violence. Noma Noma is a gangrenous lesion that affects young children living in extreme poverty primarily in Africa and Asia. Lesions are severe gingival disease followed by necrosis (premature death of cells in living tissue) of lips and chin. Many children affected by noma suffer from other infections such as measles and HIV. Without any treatment, about 90% of these children die. Cleft lip and palate Birth defects such as cleft lip and palate occur in about one per 500–700 of all births. This rate varies substantially across different ethnic groups and geographical areas. Common causes Risk factors for oral diseases include an unhealthy diet, tobacco use and harmful alcohol use. These are also risk factors for the four leading chronic diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – and oral diseases are often linked to chronic disease. Poor oral hygiene is also a risk factor for oral disease. The prevalence of oral disease varies by geographical region, and availability and accessibility of oral health services. Social determinants in oral health are also very strong. The prevalence of oral diseases is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, and in all countries, the oral disease burden is significantly higher among poor and disadvantaged population groups. Prevention and treatment The burden of oral diseases and other chronic diseases can be decreased simultaneously by addressing common risk factors. These include: decreasing sugar intake and maintaining a well-balanced nutritional intake to prevent tooth decay and premature tooth loss; consuming fruit and vegetables that can protect against oral cancer; stopping tobacco use and decreasing alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of oral cancers, periodontal disease and tooth loss; ensuring proper oral hygiene; using protective sports and motor vehicle equipment to reduce the risk of facial injuries; and safe physical environments. Dental cavities can be prevented by maintaining a constant low level of fluoride in the oral cavity. Fluoride can be obtained from fluoridated drinking water, salt, milk and toothpaste, as well as from professionally-applied fluoride or mouth rinse. Long-term exposure to an optimal level of fluoride results in fewer dental cavities in both children and adults. Most oral diseases and conditions require professional dental care, however, due to limited availability or inaccessibility, the use of oral health services is markedly low among older people, people living in rural areas, and people with low income and education. Oral health care coverage is low in low- and middle- income countries. Traditional curative dental care is a significant economic burden for many high-income countries, where 5–10% of public health expenditure relates to oral health. In low- and middle-income countries, public oral health programmes are rare. The high cost of dental treatment can be avoided by effective prevention and health promotion measures. WHO response Public health solutions for oral diseases are most effective when they are integrated with those for other chronic diseases and with national public health programmes. The WHO Global Oral Health Programme aligns its work with the strategy of chronic disease prevention and health promotion. Emphasis is put on developing global policies in oral health promotion and oral disease prevention, including: building oral health policies towards effective control of risks to oral health; stimulating development and implementation of community-based projects for oral health promotion and prevention of oral diseases, with a focus on disadvantaged and poor population groups; encouraging national health authorities to implement effective fluoride programmes for the prevention of dental caries; advocacy for a common risk factor approach to simultaneously prevent oral and other chronic diseases; and providing technical support to countries to strengthen their oral health systems and integrate oral health into public health.",{},"['risk', 'tooth', 'oral', 'chronic', 'low', 'health', 'dental', 'diseases', 'children', 'disease']","Oral health is essential to general health and quality of life.

Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake. Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 920 136 children under the age of 5 in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under five years old. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care. Causes Pneumonia is caused by a number of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are: Streptococcus pneumoniae – the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children; Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) – the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia; respiratory syncytial virus is the most common viral cause of pneumonia; in infants infected with HIV, Pneumocystis jiroveci is one of the most common causes of pneumonia, responsible for at least one quarter of all pneumonia deaths in HIV-infected infants. Transmission Pneumonia can be spread in a number of ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a childs nose or throat, can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this is of critical importance for treatment and prevention. Presenting features The presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more numerous than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under 5 years of age, who have cough and/or difficult breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing where their chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections. Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience unconsciousness, hypothermia and convulsions. Risk factors While most healthy children can fight the infection with their natural defences, children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. A childs immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or undernourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed. Pre-existing illnesses, such as symptomatic HIV infections and measles, also increase a childs risk of contracting pneumonia. The following environmental factors also increase a childs susceptibility to pneumonia: indoor air pollution caused by cooking and heating with biomass fuels (such as wood or dung) living in crowded homes parental smoking. Treatment Pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin dispersable tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia. Prevention Preventing pneumonia in children is an essential component of a strategy to reduce child mortality. Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. Adequate nutrition is key to improving childrens natural defences, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In addition to being effective in preventing pneumonia, it also helps to reduce the length of the illness if a child does become ill. Addressing environmental factors such as indoor air pollution (by providing affordable clean indoor stoves, for example) and encouraging good hygiene in crowded homes also reduces the number of children who fall ill with pneumonia. In children infected with HIV, the antibiotic cotrimoxazole is given daily to decrease the risk of contracting pneumonia. Economic costs The cost of antibiotic treatment for all children with pneumonia in 66 of the countdown to 2015 countries for maternal, newborn and child survival is estimated at around US$ 109 million per year. The price includes the antibiotics and diagnostics for pneumonia management. WHO response The WHO and UNICEF integrated Global action plan for pneumonia and diarrhoea (GAPPD) aims to accelerate pneumonia control with a combination of interventions to protect, prevent, and treat pneumonia in children with actions to: protect children from pneumonia including promoting exclusive breastfeeding and adequate complementary feeding; prevent pneumonia with vaccinations, hand washing with soap, reducing household air pollution, HIV prevention and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected and exposed children; treat pneumonia focusing on making sure that every sick child has access to the right kind of care -- either from a community-based health worker, or in a health facility if the disease is severe -- and can get the antibiotics and oxygen they need to get well; A number of countries including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia have developed district, state and national plans to intensify actions for the control of pneumonia and diarrhoea.

UNAIDS launches new Data Hub“Data Dashboard” to promote data use and Fast-Track the AIDS response in the region,,,,,"UNAIDS launches new Data Hub“Data Dashboard” to promote data use and Fast-Track the AIDS response in the region UNAIDS Recently, UNAIDS Asia and the Pacific Data Hub launched the “Data Dashboard” for Asia and the Pacific, an additional data visualization tool that enhances the array of strategic information products that are already available on the AIDS Data Hub website. The platform is developed as part of the “Regional Strategic Information Hubs” initiative by UNAIDS that aims to facilitate the dissemination of data products tailored to the region and the local audience. The new platform allows the users to visualize data and indicators related to HIV epidemiology and the response in the region through customizable maps, graphs, tables and factsheets by indicator, country, and key populations, facilitating integrated analysis, strategic intelligence and access to granular data. Accurate and credible data on the HIV epidemic are the cornerstone of the AIDS response. Over the years, a detailed understanding of the HIV epidemic has built through the collection, analysis and dissemination of data, helping programmes to reach the right people in the right place and at the right time. Having high-quality data on the AIDS response coupled with cutting edge analysis by the Data Hub has been inspirational for the countries to track the progress towards Fast-Track and Ending AIDS targets. “With concrete targets to be met on the way to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, it is vital to have the right data tracking whether Asia and the Pacific is on course to meet the commitments made in the 2016 United Nations Political Declaration on Ending AIDS. Data shows us how far we have come and how far we have to go,” says Eamonn Murphy, UNAIDS Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific. UNAIDS Asia Pacific Data Hub is not only the largest HIV data repository in the region but also the trendsetter in strategic information generation and use. UNAIDS Asia Pacific and the Data Hub work with all countries in the region to collect and analyse data on their AIDS responses and to help build the capacity to generate and use strategic information. “Data tells the story of the past, current and future. Without data, we are blind, and we would have to make our decisions by betting on the luck of our guess and speculations. UNAIDS Data Hub is helping us finding our way to ending AIDS,” comments Dr Anita Suleiman, Head of HIV/STI/Hepatitis C Sector, Disease Control Division, Ministry of Health Malaysia. In the region, no major report, speech or policy initiative on HIV is launched or made without referring to data collected and released by UNAIDS. “The Data Hub is a timely resource with reliable and timely data that meet our needs. At UNICEF, we have relied on the Data Hub for both country and regional data,” says Shirley Mark Prabhu, Regional EMTCT, Adolescent Health and HIV Specialist, UNICEF East and Pacific Regional Office, Bangkok. UNAIDS Data Hub in Asia and the Pacific is tri faceted model - the website; data repository; technical assistance and capacity building. The Data Hub team has been working closely with community particularly on the strengthening capacity of young community members on data literacy, data interpretation and use. ""Research and data, coupled with the lived experience of our community, provide the evidence we need for an effective response to HIV. UNAIDS Data Hub is an essential tool for helping community-based HIV workers across the Asia Pacific region access relevant research and data to amplify their advocacy for better services, more funding, and the scaling up of programming. Other stakeholders such as government and development agencies can also use the information to respond better to the needs of our communities in local contexts to ensure resources are maximized,"" explains Midnight Poonkasetwattana, APCOM Executive Director.

The World Hepatitis Day activities are designed to: showcase emerging national responses to hepatitis in heavy burden countries; to encourage actions and engagement by individuals, partners and the public. Global Health Sector Strategy report on viral hepatitis Overview In May 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on viral hepatitis 2016–2021. The GHSS calls for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (reducing new infections by 90% and mortality by 65%). This WHO Global hepatitis report describes, for the ﬁrst time, the global and regional estimates on viral hepatitis in 2015, setting the baseline for tracking progress in implementing the new global strategy. The report focuses on hepatitis B and C, which are responsible for 96% of all hepatitis mortality. It presents data along the ﬁve strategic directions (strategic information, interventions, equity, ﬁnancing and innovation) – key pillars of the GHSS to facilitate monitoring of progress in countries, regions and globally, and to measure the impact of interventions on reducing new infections and saving lives between 2015 and 2030. New hepatitis data highlight need for urgent global response New WHO data reveal that an estimated 325 million people worldwide are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The WHO Global hepatitis report, 2017 indicates that the large majority of these people lack access to life-saving testing and treatment. As a result, millions of people are at risk of a slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer, and death. ""Viral hepatitis is now recognized as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. ""Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist, and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them."" Increasing mortality, new infections Viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths in 2015, a number comparable to deaths caused by tuberculosis and HIV. But while mortality from tuberculosis and HIV has been declining, deaths from hepatitis are on the increase. Approximately 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015, bringing the global total of people living with hepatitis C to 71 Although overall deaths from hepatitis are increasing, new infections of HBV are falling, thanks to increased coverage of HBV vaccination among children. Globally, 84% of children born in 2015 received the 3 recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Between the pre-vaccine era (which, according to the year of introduction can range from the 1980s to the early 2000s) and 2015, the proportion of children under 5 years of age with new infections fell from 4.7% to 1.3%. However, an estimated 257 million people, mostly adults born before the introduction of the HBV vaccine, were living with chronic hepatitis B infection in 2015. Epidemics in regions and ""hotspots"" Hepatitis B levels vary widely across WHO regions with the WHO African Region and WHO Western Pacific Region sharing the greatest burden. WHO Western Pacific Region: 6.2% of population (115 million people) WHO African Region: 6.1% of population (60 million people) WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 3.3% of population (21 million people) WHO South-East Asia Region: 2% of population (39 million people) WHO European Region: 1.6% of population (15 million people) WHO Region of the Americas: 0.7% of population (7 million people) Today, unsafe injections in health care settings and injecting drug use are considered to be the most common routes of HCV transmissions. HCV prevalence by WHO region is: WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: 2.3% of population (15 million people) WHO European Region: 1.5% of population (14 million people) WHO African Region: 1% of population (11 million people) WHO Region of the Americas: 1% of population (7 million people) WHO Western Pacific Region: 1% of population (14 million people) WHO South-East Asia Region: 0.5% of population (10 million people) Treatment access is low There is currently no vaccine against HCV, and access to treatment for HBV and HCV is still low. WHOs Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis aims to test 90% and treat 80% of people with HBV and HCV by 2030. The report notes that just 9% of all HBV infections and 20% of all HCV infections were diagnosed in 2015. An even smaller fraction – 8% of those diagnosed with HBV infection (1.7 million people) were on treatment, and only 7% of those diagnosed with HCV infection (1.1 million people) had started curative treatment during that year. HBV infection requires lifelong treatment, and WHO currently recommends the medicine tenofovir, already widely used in HIV treatment. Hepatitis C can be cured within a relatively short time using the highly effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). ""We are still at an early stage of the viral hepatitis response, but the way forward looks promising,"" said Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHOs Department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme. ""More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need – a diagnostic test costs less than US$ 1 and the cure for hepatitis C can be below US$ 200. But the data clearly highlight the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment."" Country progress WHOs Global hepatitis report, 2017 demonstrates that despite challenges, some countries are taking successful steps to scale-up hepatitis services. China achieved high coverage (96%) for the timely birth dose of HBV vaccines, and reached the hepatitis B control goal of less than 1% prevalence in children under the age of 5 in 2015. Mongolia improved uptake of hepatitis treatment by including HBV and HCV medicines in its National Health Insurance scheme, which covers 98% of its population. In Egypt, generic competition has reduced the price of a 3-month cure for hepatitis C, from US$ 900 in 2015, to less than US$ 200 in 2016. Today in Pakistan, the same course costs as little as US$ 100. Improving access to hepatitis C cure received a boost at the end of March 2017, when WHO prequalified the generic active pharmaceutical ingredient of sofosbuvir. This step will enable more countries to produce affordable hepatitis medicines. Baseline for elimination WHOs Global hepatitis report, 2017 aims to provide a starting point for hepatitis elimination by indicating baseline statistics on HBV and HCV infections, including mortality, and coverage levels of key interventions. Hepatitis B and C – the 2 main types out of 5 different hepatitis infections – are responsible for 96% of overall hepatitis mortality.

US biologist: Gene-editing work a failure of self-regulation,,,,,"US biologist: Gene-editing work a failure of self-regulation Independent Online Desk/AP Feng Zhang, center, an institute member of Harvard and MITs Broad Institute, is surrounded by reporters while speaking on the issue of worlds first genetically edited babies after the Human Genome Editing Conference in Hong Kong, Tuesday, Nov. 27, 2018. Photo: AP A leader of an international conference on gene editing said Wednesday that the work of a Chinese scientist who claims to have helped make the worlds first gene-edited babies showed a failure of self-regulation among scientists. Nobel laureate David Baltimore said the work of the scientist who made the claim would ""be considered irresponsible"" because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered. Baltimore spoke at an international conference in Hong Kong, where the Chinese scientist, He Jiankui (HEH JEE-ahn-qway) of Shenzhen, made his first public comments since his work was revealed. He said the twin girls were born this month. He said they were conceived to try to help them resist possible future infection with the AIDS virus. Baltimore said he didnt think that was medically necessary. He said the case showed ""there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community"" and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field. Another prominent American scientist speaking at the conference, Harvard Medical School dean Dr. George Daley, warned against a backlash to Hes claim. Daley said it would be unfortunate if a misstep with a first case led scientists and regulators to reject the good that could come from altering DNA to treat or prevent diseases. He has said his lab used the powerful gene-editing tool CRISPR to alter the DNA of human embryos. There is not yet independent confirmation of his claim, but scientists and regulators have been swift to condemn the experiment as unethical and unscientific. The National Health Commission has ordered local officials in Guangdong province to investigate Hes actions, and his employer, Southern University of Science and Technology, is investigating as well. The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods. He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.

This is so because it concerns the population pattern and survival of humankind on the planet. Since the latter part of the twentieth century and in the new millennium, considerable focus has been placed on this crucial issue in developed and developing countries. Sensitization of the people through behaviour change communications, advocacy measures, dissemination of information about reproductive health, gender empowerment and safe motherhood, campaign for containment of AIDS/HIV/STDS, improved drugs, to fight these and others. Kwasi Odoi Agyarko, winner of the 2002 United Nations’ Population Award defines reproductive health as a marriage between social sciences and medical sciences because it affects everybody. It reflects health in childhood and sets the stage for health even beyond the reproductive years for both women and men. The five core areas of reproductive health are healthy child bearing, fertility regulation, maintenance of a healthy reproductive system, sexuality and sexual behaviour and the social and cultural context within which reproductive behaviour and ill health take place. Cost effective service-based strategies for preventing or treating reproductive health problems exist among many leading issues in this field. Preventive approaches in the form of family planning, safe sex, immunization and breast feeding promotion programmes are at the heart of efforts to combat unwanted and unplanned pregnancy, STDs, HIV/ AIDS, induced abortion, maternal morbidity and mortality and general ill-health.",{},"['safe', 'crucial', 'sciences', 'social', 'healthy', 'medical', 'editor', 'health', 'reproductive', 'population', 'behaviour']","From the EditorOur cover this week is Reproductive Health.

The public inquiry into the scandal is not due to look at financial support until 2020. Campaign group Tainted Blood said, at the current rate, 112 more people would die before the issue was resolved. The Cabinet Office said it ""will consider"" calls for improved support. Labour MP Diana Johnson - co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Haemophilia and Contaminated Blood - told the BBCs Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""The state has harmed these people, and the state now needs to step up and compensate them properly."" Decisive action A public inquiry opened last month looking into how thousands of people in the 1970s and 80s were given blood products infected with hepatitis viruses and HIV. It is thought more than 2,400 people have died, while many others have been left in very poor health. Last week, inquiry chairman Sir Brian Langstaff wrote to the Cabinet Office describing how some families had ""lost everything"" and ""had to live on the breadline"". He asked the government to take ""decisive action"" to tackle the issue of financial compensation. The Cabinet Office has said it ""will consider"" the recommendations and ""respond as soon as possible"". UK-wide disparity Tainted Blood, the largest support group for victims, has now written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock asking the government to address what it says is an ""unacceptable delay"" in dealing with finances. In the letter, seen by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, it calls for support payments in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to be increased to the level received by Scottish victims of the scandal. ""I believe it will be a matter of deep and future shame for this government if it fails to act, and act quickly,"" said Andrew Evans, chairman of the group. As it stands there are a number of complex financial support schemes running across the UK. Payments can range from under £5,000 a year to more than £36,000. In most cases, Scottish victims of the scandal and their families receive more than victims living in Wales, with those in Northern Ireland and England receiving the least. The campaign group says someone infected with both HIV and early-stage hepatitis C in Scotland can receive a lump sum of £50,000 plus £37,000 a year in support payments. In England a victim in a similar condition would receive around £26,500 a year with no lump sum. The widow of someone infected in a Scottish hospital can receive an annual support payment of £27,250 compared with a single one-off payment of £10,000 in England. The group is now asking asking for parity with the Scottish system, for payments to be backdated, and all widows payments to be paid regardless of whether the victim has remarried or formed a civil partnership. Labour MP Diana Johnson said there was ""no reason at all why our government couldnt decide now, even though the public inquiry is under way, to say, Right, were going to compensate these people and pay them properly"". She said that as an interim measure, payments in other parts of the UK should be brought up to the same level as those in Scotland, but that she ""still [doesnt] think thats enough"". She said in ""many cases"" the lives of those affected had been ""destroyed"". What is the contaminated blood scandal about? Around 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with hepatitis viruses in the 1970s and 80s. It is thought more than 1,250 were also infected with HIV. Nearly 3,000 of them have since died. They were injected with a treatment - either Factor VIII or IV - used to help their blood clot. But Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment and so supplies were imported from the US. Much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. Other victims who had blood transfusions after surgery were also exposed to contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the blood products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk.",{},"['scottish', 'increase', 'infected', 'group', 'contaminated', 'blood', 'victims', 'scandal', 'receive', 'payments', 'support']","Jim Reed­­­Victims of the NHS contaminated blood scandal have written to the health secretary asking for an immediate increase in support payments, the BBC has learned.

Oral health is essential to general health and quality of life. It is a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual’s capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing. Oral diseases and conditions The most common oral diseases are dental cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, oral cancer, oral infectious diseases, trauma from injuries, and hereditary lesions. Dental cavities Worldwide, 60–90% of school children and nearly 100% of adults have dental cavities, often leading to pain and discomfort. Periodontal disease Severe periodontal (gum) disease, which may result in tooth loss, is found in 15–20% of middle-aged (35-44 years) adults. Tooth loss Dental cavities and periodontal disease are major causes of tooth loss. Complete loss of natural teeth is widespread and particularly affects older people. Globally, about 30% of people aged 65–74 have no natural teeth. Oral cancer The incidence of oral cancer ranges from one to 10 cases per 100 000 people in most countries. The prevalence of oral cancer is relatively higher in men, in older people, and among people of low education and low income. Tobacco and alcohol are major causal factors. Fungal, bacterial or viral infections in HIV Almost half (40–50%) of people who are HIV-positive have oral fungal, bacterial or viral infections. These often occur early in the course of HIV infection. Oro-dental trauma Across the world, 16-40% of children in the age range 6 to12 years old are affected by dental trauma due to unsafe playgrounds, unsafe schools, road accidents, or violence. Noma Noma is a gangrenous lesion that affects young children living in extreme poverty primarily in Africa and Asia. Lesions are severe gingival disease followed by necrosis (premature death of cells in living tissue) of lips and chin. Many children affected by noma suffer from other infections such as measles and HIV. Without any treatment, about 90% of these children die. Cleft lip and palate Birth defects such as cleft lip and palate occur in about one per 500–700 of all births. This rate varies substantially across different ethnic groups and geographical areas. Common causes Risk factors for oral diseases include an unhealthy diet, tobacco use and harmful alcohol use. These are also risk factors for the four leading chronic diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – and oral diseases are often linked to chronic disease. Poor oral hygiene is also a risk factor for oral disease. The prevalence of oral disease varies by geographical region, and availability and accessibility of oral health services. Social determinants in oral health are also very strong. The prevalence of oral diseases is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, and in all countries, the oral disease burden is significantly higher among poor and disadvantaged population groups. Prevention and treatment The burden of oral diseases and other chronic diseases can be decreased simultaneously by addressing common risk factors. These include: decreasing sugar intake and maintaining a well-balanced nutritional intake to prevent tooth decay and premature tooth loss; consuming fruit and vegetables that can protect against oral cancer; stopping tobacco use and decreasing alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of oral cancers, periodontal disease and tooth loss; ensuring proper oral hygiene; using protective sports and motor vehicle equipment to reduce the risk of facial injuries; and safe physical environments. Dental cavities can be prevented by maintaining a constant low level of fluoride in the oral cavity. Fluoride can be obtained from fluoridated drinking water, salt, milk and toothpaste, as well as from professionally-applied fluoride or mouth rinse. Long-term exposure to an optimal level of fluoride results in fewer dental cavities in both children and adults. Most oral diseases and conditions require professional dental care, however, due to limited availability or inaccessibility, the use of oral health services is markedly low among older people, people living in rural areas, and people with low income and education. Oral health care coverage is low in low- and middle- income countries. Traditional curative dental care is a significant economic burden for many high-income countries, where 5–10% of public health expenditure relates to oral health. In low- and middle-income countries, public oral health programmes are rare. The high cost of dental treatment can be avoided by effective prevention and health promotion measures. WHO response Public health solutions for oral diseases are most effective when they are integrated with those for other chronic diseases and with national public health programmes. The WHO Global Oral Health Programme aligns its work with the strategy of chronic disease prevention and health promotion. Emphasis is put on developing global policies in oral health promotion and oral disease prevention, including: building oral health policies towards effective control of risks to oral health; stimulating development and implementation of community-based projects for oral health promotion and prevention of oral diseases, with a focus on disadvantaged and poor population groups; encouraging national health authorities to implement effective fluoride programmes for the prevention of dental caries; advocacy for a common risk factor approach to simultaneously prevent oral and other chronic diseases; and providing technical support to countries to strengthen their oral health systems and integrate oral health into public health.",{},"['risk', 'tooth', 'oral', 'chronic', 'low', 'health', 'dental', 'diseases', 'children', 'disease']","Oral health is essential to general health and quality of life.

Pneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake. Pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in children worldwide. Every year, it kills an estimated 1.1 million children under the age of five years, accounting for 18% of all deaths of children under five years old worldwide. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care. Causes Pneumonia is caused by a number of infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are: Streptococcus pneumoniae – the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children; Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) – the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia; respiratory syncytial virus is the most common viral cause of pneumonia; in infants infected with HIV, Pneumocystis jiroveci is one of the commonest causes of pneumonia, responsible for at least one quarter of all pneumonia deaths in HIV-infected infants. Transmission Pneumonia can be spread in a number of ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a childs nose or throat, can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this has critical importance for treatment and prevention. Presenting features The presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more numerous than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under five years of age, who have cough and/or difficult breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing where their chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections. Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience unconsciousness, hypothermia and convulsions. Risk factors While most healthy children can fight the infection with their natural defences, children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. A childs immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or undernourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed. Pre-existing illnesses, such as symptomatic HIV infections and measles, also increase a childs risk of contracting pneumonia. The following environmental factors also increase a childs susceptibility to pneumonia: indoor air pollution caused by cooking and heating with biomass fuels (such as wood or dung) living in crowded homes parental smoking. Treatment Pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia, and for all cases of pneumonia in infants younger than two months of age. Prevention Preventing pneumonia in children is an essential component of a strategy to reduce child mortality. Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. Adequate nutrition is key to improving childrens natural defences, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. In addition to being effective in preventing pneumonia, it also helps to reduce the length of the illness if a child does become ill. Addressing environmental factors such as indoor air pollution (by providing affordable clean indoor stoves, for example) and encouraging good hygiene in crowded homes also reduces the number of children who fall ill with pneumonia. In children infected with HIV, the antibiotic cotrimoxazole is given daily to decrease the risk of contracting pneumonia. Economic costs The cost of antibiotic treatment for all children with pneumonia in 66 of the countdown to 2015 countries for maternal, newborn and child survival is estimated at around US$ 109 million per year. The price includes the antibiotics and diagnostics for pneumonia management. WHO response WHO and UNICEF launched the integrated Global action plan for pneumonia and diarrhoea (GAPPD) in 2013. The aim is to accelerate pneumonia control with a combination of interventions to protect, prevent, and treat pneumonia in children with actions to: protect children from pneumonia include promoting exclusive breastfeeding and adequate complementary feeding; prevent pneumonia with vaccinations, hand washing with soap, reducing household air pollution, HIV prevention and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected and exposed children; treat pneumonia which are focused on making sure that every sick child has access to the right kind of care -- either from a community-based health worker, or in a health facility if the disease is severe -- and can get the antibiotics and oxygen they need to get well.

However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. Women who have been physically or sexually abused by their partners are more than twice as likely to have an abortion, almost twice as likely to experience depression, and in some regions, 1.5 times more likely to acquire HIV, as compared to women who have not experienced partner violence. Although little data is available—and great variation in how psychological violence is measured across countries and cultures—existing evidence shows high prevalence rates. Forty-three per cent of women in the 28 European Union Member States have experienced some form of psychological violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. It is estimated that of all women who were the victims of homicide globally in 2012, almost half were killed by intimate partners or family members, compared to less than six per cent of men killed in the same year. More than 1 in 4 women in Washington DC, United States, have experienced some form of sexual harassment on public transportation, according to a survey conducted in 2016. Worldwide, almost 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18thbirthday. Child marriage is more common in West and Central Africa, where over 4 in 10 girls were married before age 18, and about 1 in 7 were married or in union before age 15. Child marriage often results in early pregnancy and social isolation, interrupts schooling, limits the girl’s opportunities and increases her risk of experiencing domestic violence. Around 120 million girls worldwide (slightly more than 1 in 10) have experienced forced intercourse or other forced sexual acts at some point in their lives. By far the most common perpetrators of sexual violence against girls are current or former husbands, partners or boyfriends. At least 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone female genital mutilation in the 30 countries with representative data on prevalence. In most of these countries, the majority of girls were cut before age 5. Adult women account for 51 per cent of all human trafficking victims detected globally. Women and girls together account for 71 per cent, with girls representing nearly three out of every four child trafficking victims. Nearly three out of every four trafficked women and girls are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. One in 10 women in the European Union report having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15 (including having received unwanted, offensive sexually explicit emails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on social networking sites). The risk is highest among young women between 18 and 29 years of age. An estimated 246 million girls and boys experience school-related violence every year and one in four girls say that they never feel comfortable using school latrines, according to a survey on youth conducted across four regions. The extent and forms of school-related violence that girls and boys experience differ, but evidence suggests that girls are at greater risk of sexual violence, harassment and exploitation. In addition to the resulting adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences, school-related gender-based violence is a major obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls. Twenty-three per cent of female undergraduate university students reported having experienced sexual assault or sexual misconduct in a survey across 27 universities in the United States in 2015. Rates of reporting to campus officials, law enforcement or others ranged from 5 to 28 per cent, depending on the specific type of behavior. Eighty-two per cent of women parliamentarians who participated in a study conducted by the Inter-parliamentary Union in 39 countries across 5 regions reported having experienced some form of psychological violence while serving their terms. Psychological violence was defined as remarks, gestures and images of a sexist or humiliating sexual nature made against them or threats and/or mobbing to which they might have been subjected. They cited social media as the main channel through which such psychological violence is perpetrated; nearly half of those surveyed (44 per cent) reported having received death, rape, assault or abduction threats towards them or their families. Measures to address violence In the majority of countries with available data, less than 40 per cent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort. Among women who do, most look to family and friends and very few look to formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than 10 per cent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police. At least 140 countries have passed laws on domestic violence, and 144 have laws on sexual harassment. However, even when laws exist, this does not mean they are always compliant with international standards and recommendations or implemented. Still, 37 countries exempt rape perpetrators from prosecution when they are married to or subsequently marry the victim. Availability of data on violence against women has increased significantly in recent years. Since 1995, more than 100 countries have conducted at least one survey addressing the issue. More than 40 countries conducted at least two surveys in the period between 1995 and 2014, which means that, depending on the comparability of the surveys, changes over time could be analysed. Violence among vulnerable groups Evidence suggests that certain characteristics of women, such as sexual orientation, disability status or ethnicity, and some contextual factors, such as humanitarian crises, including conflict and post-conflict situations, may increase women’s vulnerability to violence. In 2014, 23 per cent of non-heterosexual women (those who identified their sexual orientation as lesbian, bisexual or other) interviewed in the European Union indicated having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by both male and female non-partner perpetrators, compared with five per cent of heterosexual women. In a survey of 3,706 primary schoolchildren from Uganda, 24 per cent of 11 to 14-year-old girls with disabilities reported sexual violence at school, compared to 12 per cent of non-disabled girls.",{},"['sexual', 'countries', 'having', 'figures', 'survey', 'violence', 'women', 'girls', 'experienced', 'ending', 'facts', 'union', 'cent']","Various forms of violenceIt is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives.

Oral health is essential to general health and quality of life. It is a state of being free from mouth and facial pain, oral and throat cancer, oral infection and sores, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay, tooth loss, and other diseases and disorders that limit an individual’s capacity in biting, chewing, smiling, speaking, and psychosocial wellbeing. Oral diseases and conditions The most common oral diseases are dental cavities, periodontal (gum) disease, oral cancer, oral infectious diseases, trauma from injuries, and hereditary lesions. Dental cavities Worldwide, 60–90% of school children and nearly 100% of adults have dental cavities, often leading to pain and discomfort. Periodontal disease Severe periodontal (gum) disease, which may result in tooth loss, is found in 15–20% of middle-aged (35-44 years) adults. Tooth loss Dental cavities and periodontal disease are major causes of tooth loss. Complete loss of natural teeth is widespread and particularly affects older people. Globally, about 30% of people aged 65–74 have no natural teeth. Oral cancer The incidence of oral cancer ranges from one to 10 cases per 100 000 people in most countries. The prevalence of oral cancer is relatively higher in men, in older people, and among people of low education and low income. Tobacco and alcohol are major causal factors. Fungal, bacterial or viral infections in HIV Almost half (40–50%) of people who are HIV-positive have oral fungal, bacterial or viral infections. These often occur early in the course of HIV infection. Oro-dental trauma Across the world, 16-40% of children in the age range 6 to12 years old are affected by dental trauma due to unsafe playgrounds, unsafe schools, road accidents, or violence. Noma Noma is a gangrenous lesion that affects young children living in extreme poverty primarily in Africa and Asia. Lesions are severe gingival disease followed by necrosis (premature death of cells in living tissue) of lips and chin. Many children affected by noma suffer from other infections such as measles and HIV. Without any treatment, about 90% of these children die. Cleft lip and palate Birth defects such as cleft lip and palate occur in about one per 500–700 of all births. This rate varies substantially across different ethnic groups and geographical areas. Common causes Risk factors for oral diseases include an unhealthy diet, tobacco use and harmful alcohol use. These are also risk factors for the four leading chronic diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – and oral diseases are often linked to chronic disease. Poor oral hygiene is also a risk factor for oral disease. The prevalence of oral disease varies by geographical region, and availability and accessibility of oral health services. Social determinants in oral health are also very strong. The prevalence of oral diseases is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, and in all countries, the oral disease burden is significantly higher among poor and disadvantaged population groups. Prevention and treatment The burden of oral diseases and other chronic diseases can be decreased simultaneously by addressing common risk factors. These include: decreasing sugar intake and maintaining a well-balanced nutritional intake to prevent tooth decay and premature tooth loss; consuming fruit and vegetables that can protect against oral cancer; stopping tobacco use and decreasing alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of oral cancers, periodontal disease and tooth loss; ensuring proper oral hygiene; using protective sports and motor vehicle equipment to reduce the risk of facial injuries; and safe physical environments. Dental cavities can be prevented by maintaining a constant low level of fluoride in the oral cavity. Fluoride can be obtained from fluoridated drinking water, salt, milk and toothpaste, as well as from professionally-applied fluoride or mouth rinse. Long-term exposure to an optimal level of fluoride results in fewer dental cavities in both children and adults. Most oral diseases and conditions require professional dental care, however, due to limited availability or inaccessibility, the use of oral health services is markedly low among older people, people living in rural areas, and people with low income and education. Oral health care coverage is low in low- and middle- income countries. Traditional curative dental care is a significant economic burden for many high-income countries, where 5–10% of public health expenditure relates to oral health. In low- and middle-income countries, public oral health programmes are rare. The high cost of dental treatment can be avoided by effective prevention and health promotion measures. WHO response Public health solutions for oral diseases are most effective when they are integrated with those for other chronic diseases and with national public health programmes. The WHO Global Oral Health Programme aligns its work with the strategy of chronic disease prevention and health promotion. Emphasis is put on developing global policies in oral health promotion and oral disease prevention, including: building oral health policies towards effective control of risks to oral health; stimulating development and implementation of community-based projects for oral health promotion and prevention of oral diseases, with a focus on disadvantaged and poor population groups; encouraging national health authorities to implement effective fluoride programmes for the prevention of dental caries; advocacy for a common risk factor approach to simultaneously prevent oral and other chronic diseases; and providing technical support to countries to strengthen their oral health systems and integrate oral health into public health.

Dr Ashish Kumar Shaha said the existing challenges of Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) tuberculosis should be faced collectively as its consequences are very dangerous. He said there is no alternative to concerted efforts to check the contagious disease as all the MDR TB patients always breed more other identical category of patients through quick transmission. TB is an infectious disease that usually spreads out through breathing of the affected patients. He underscored the need for conducting massive awareness and searching programmes to detect the TB in the slum and char areas of the district without further delay.

Officials said plans were being chalked up to start a massive motivational campaign among the Rohingyas to keep their family size smaller alongside providing them kits containing birth control pills and other contraceptives also to prevent outbreak of sexually transmitted diseases (STD). ""We have already mobilised 6 medical teams, three in Teknaf and three others are operating in Ukhia to create awareness among Rohingyas about sexual transmitted diseases and birth control methods,"" Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammed Nasim told BSS. He said the ministry took initiatives to provide them short term birth control kits which were expected to protect them from STDs as well. Officials and experts said the initiative appeared crucial as the reproduction rate amongthe backward Rohingya community was high while they lacked ideas of birth control systems. Director general of Health Services Professor Dr Abul Kalam Azad said a team led by the director general of family planning already visited the makeshift Rohingya camps earlier this week and developed a strategy to launch the campaign. Primarily, he said, the ministry planned to provide them short-term family planning kits containing condoms, birth control pills and birth control injections. ""They are not familiar with the methods of controlling birth . . . as a result most of the families have five to seven children,"" the health services chief said.

FDA approves Genvoya,,,,,"FDA approves Genvoya The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Genvoya (elvitegravir 150 mg/cobicistat 150 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg or E/C/F/TAF) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Although Genvoya has efficacy comparable to Stribild (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or E/C/F/TDF), the tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) combination demonstrated an improved safety profile compared to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) combination in clinical trials. Important information Genvoya can cause serious side effects, including: Build-up of lactic acid in your blood (lactic acidosis). Lactic acidosis may happen in some people who take Genvoya. Lactic acidosis is a serious medical emergency that can lead to death. Lactic acidosis can be hard to identify early, because the symptoms could seem like symptoms of other health problems. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms which could be signs of lactic acidosis: feel very weak or tired have unusual (not normal) muscle pain have trouble breathing have stomach pain with nausea vomiting feel cold, especially in your arms and legs feel dizzy or lightheaded have a fast or irregular heartbeat Severe liver problems. Severe liver problems may happen in people who take Genvoya. In some cases, these liver problems can lead to death. Your liver may become large (hepatomegaly) and you may develop fat in your liver (steatosis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms of liver problems: your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice) dark ""tea-colored"" urine light-colored bowel movements (stools) loss of appetite for several days or longer nausea stomach pain You may be more likely to get lactic acidosis or severe liver problems if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking Genvoya for a long time. Worsening of Hepatitis B infection. Genvoya is not for use to treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. If you have hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and take Genvoya, your HBV may get worse (flareup) if you stop taking Genvoya. A “flare-up” is when your HBV infection suddenly returns in a worse way than before. Do not run out of this medicine. Refill your prescription or talk to your healthcare provider before your Genvoya is all gone. Do not stop taking this medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. If you stop taking Genvoya, your healthcare provider will need to check your health often and do blood tests regularly for several months to check your HBV infection. Tell your healthcare provider about any new or unusual symptoms you may have after you stop treatment. Genvoya is a prescription medicine that is used without other antiretroviral medicines to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) in people 12 years of age and older: who have not received anti-HIV-1 medicines in the past, or to replace their current anti-HIV-1 medicines: in people who have been on the same anti-HIV-1 medicine regimen for at least 6 months, and who have an amount of HIV-1 in their blood (this is called viral load) that is less than 50 copies/mL, and have never failed past HIV-1 treatment. HIV-1 is the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Genvoya contains the prescription medicines elvitegravir (Vitekta), cobicistat (Tybost), emtricitabine (Emtriva) and tenofovir alafenamide. It is not known if Genvoya is safe and effective in children under 12 years of age. When used to treat HIV-1 infection, Genvoya may: Reduce the amount of HIV-1 in your blood. This is called ""viral load"". Increase the number of CD4+ (T) cells in your blood that help fight off other infections. Reducing the amount of HIV-1 and increasing the CD4+ (T) cells in your blood may help improve your immune system. This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak (opportunistic infections). Genvoya does not cure HIV-1 infections or AIDS. You must stay on continuous HIV-1 therapy to control HIV-1 infection and decrease HIV-related illnesses. Avoid doing things that can spread HIV-1 infection to others. Do not share or re-use needles or other injection equipment. Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, like toothbrushes and razor blades. Do not have any kind of sex without protection. Always practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen, vaginal secretions, or blood. Ask your healthcare provider if you have any questions about how to prevent passing HIV-1 to other people. Do not take Genvoya if you also take a medicine that contains: alfuzosin hydrochloride (Uroxatral) carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol, Tegretol-XR, Teril) cisapride (Propulsid, Propulsid Quicksolv) ergot-containing medicines, including: dihydroergotamine mesylate (D.H.E. 45, Migranal) ergotamine tartrate (Cafergot, Migergot, Ergostat, Medihaler Ergotamine, Wigraine, Wigrettes) methylergonovine maleate (Ergotrate, Methergine) lovastatin (Advicor, Altoprev, Mevacor) midazolam, when taken by mouth phenobarbital (Luminal) phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek) pimozide (Orap) rifampin (Rifadin, Rifamate, Rifater, Rimactane) sildenafil (Revatio), when used for treating the lung problem, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) simvastatin (Simcor, Vytorin, Zocor) triazolam (Halcion) St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) or a product that contains St. John’s wort Before taking Genvoya, tell your healthcare provider if you: have liver problems, including hepatitis B infection have kidney problems have bone problems have any other medical conditions are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if Genvoya can harm your unborn baby. Tell your healthcare provider if you become pregnant during treatment. Pregnancy registry: There is a pregnancy registry for women who take antiviral medicines during pregnancy. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about how you can take part in this registry. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Do not breastfeed if you take Genvoya. You should not breastfeed if you have HIV-1 because of the risk of passing HIV-1 to your baby. At least one of the medicines in Genvoya can pass to your baby in your breast milk. It is not known if the other medicines in Genvoya can pass into your breast milk. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Some medicines may interact with Genvoya. Keep a list of your medicines and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with Genvoya. Do not start a new medicine without telling your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can tell you if it is safe to take Genvoya with other medicines. Genvoya side effects Genvoya may cause serious side effects, including: Changes in body fat can happen in people who take HIV-1 medicine. These changes may include increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck (“buffalo hump”), breast, and around the middle of your body (trunk). Loss of fat from the legs, arms and face may also happen. The exact cause and long-term health effects of these conditions are not known. Changes in your immune system (Immune Reconstitution Syndrome) can happen when you start taking HIV-1 medicines. Your immune system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV-1 medicine. New or worse kidney problems, including kidney failure. Your healthcare provider should do blood and urine tests to check your kidneys before you start, and during treatment. Your healthcare provider may tell you to stop treatment if you develop new or worse kidney problems. Bone problems. May include bone pain, softening or thinning (which may lead to fractures). Your healthcare provider may need to do tests to check your bones. The most common side effect is nausea. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

The…",,2019-04-19,Public health issues in Bangladesh  | theindependentbd.com,"In South-East Asia the main public health issues are infectious diseases and communicable diseases. Public health has improved markedly in Bangladesh over the past three decades. Nevertheless, Bangladesh faces major health challenges. A scoping study was performed according to York methodology. The study was aimed to find out the major public health issues and challenges in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has one of the worst burdens of childhood malnutrition in the world. Communicable diseases are a major cause of death and disability in Bangladesh. Unsafe food remains a major threat to public health each year, citizens suffer from the acute effects of food contaminated by microbial pathogens, chemical substances and toxins. Bangladesh still ranks among the top ten countries in the world with the highest TB burden. Pneumonia and other infections are major causes of death among young children. In Bangladesh only one per cent of the population is reported to be HIV-positive, but rates are much higher among high-risk populations: injecting drug users, sex workers, and men who have sex with men. The toll of non-communicable diseases chronic diseases, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic respiratory diseases is increasing in Bangladesh as the population becomes more urbanized. The converging pressures of global climate change and urbanisation have a devastating effect on Bangladesh’s most vulnerable populations.The disease burden Bangladesh is further exacerbated by unsanitary living conditions that underscore the poor economic conditions of both urban and rural home dwellers. There are still several issues that Bangladesh health care system is yet to tackle, governance, accessibility and affordability are key issues that are preventing the implementation of solutions to the public health issues in Bangladesh. Unsafe food remains a major threat to public health each year; citizens suffer from the acute effects of food contaminated by microbial pathogens, chemical substances and toxins. There is a need to minimize the consumers exposure to unhygienic, contaminated and adulterated food and drinks through strict laws to control marketing of such products. One such factor is violence against women. This is a widespread social problem that causes mental stress, physical suffering and even death, and is believed to be grossly underreported. One study reveals that in Bangladesh about 52 per cent of men in both urban and rural sites reported ever physically assaulting female intimate partners. However the disease burden in Bangladesh has shifted from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases. Over the past 45 years, Bangladeshs health and nutrition policies and programmes have focused largely on rural health services and outcomes.The rural population, particularly the poor, can go to the community clinics at the village and ward levels for treatment of basic diseases and maternal health care. Unfortunately for the urban poor, especially those living in slums, these facilities are non-existent. Often the only option these residents have is to either visit expensive private facilities or oft-neglected public hospitals. Thus, unless you have money and a good amount at that, there arent many places you can go to for treatment and relief. Equitable access to quality health and nutrition services for the urban poor has emerged as a major and pressing development issue. Hospitals and clinics are not necessarily physically distant, but they are socially and financially distant from poor urban populations. Government facilities that are meant to cater to the poor are functioning badly. A recent investigation from the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) revealed an astonishingly sad scenario. About 40 per cent of doctors in 11 public hospitals and health centres were found to be absent from their workplaces. Due to lack of supervision from the authorities, the doctors and nurses are often found to be very inefficient and this further weakens the prospect of poor people being unable to get access to proper health care services from public hospitals. Bangladesh is being urbanised at a rapid pace, fuelled by rural poverty, climate change and the promise of a better economic future.It is estimated that 300,000 to 400,000 new migrants leave their rural homesteads annually, heading for Dhaka. Dhaka is overwhelmed by urban poverty and slums. Very high population densities and deteriorating city infrastructures worsen the already difficult living conditions of poor people living in Dhaka. Issues of urbanisation have been taking centre stage, as traditional focus of economic policymakers has been relegated to the rural front. Experts concur that the quality of life of the urban poor is also worse than that of the rural poor. The factors that differentiate the urban poor from the rural also include transient living, environmental hazards, social fragmentation, exposure to crimes, violence and accidents. Therefore, the transition from rural to urban life is far from linear and usually a complex process. Often, the urban poor living in slums bear the largest burden of such hazards and the evidence suggest that slum-dwellers are considerably worse off in almost every aspect of life. Within this framework of multidimensional poverty, health remains at the forefront of deprivations faced by the urban poor. While health shocks are a major source of vulnerability among low-income urban households, it is also important to recognise ill health as a chronic condition emerging from adverse living and working conditions that often require greater resources to manage over the medium- to long term.Additionally, changing lifestyles, malnutrition, persistent social inequality, economic insecurity, and unstable social life have given rise to new health challenges non-communicable diseases, substance misuse, and mental health problems. Strengthening and reinforcing local-level involvement by urban governments to be responsible for their health services, with support from the two relevant central ministries Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is required to resolve the health issues arising from rapid urbanisation. Also, aligning donor support from international organisations such as USAID and World Bank with the central governments urban health strategy is important to bring about viable change. Overall, unless a strong government institutional mechanism is established, it is difficult to envision the urban poors equitable access to primary health care services any time soon. Failure to improve urban health could undermine and erode the gains that Bangladesh has achieved as the country continues to urbanise, not only in terms of health but in terms of the growth in consumption. NGOs and private providers such as NGO Health Service Delivery Project, the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project, Marie Stopes Clinics, and BRAC Manoshi project fill in some of the gap in urban primary health. Yet, their scope and coverage are limited.In the first national survey to measure blood pressure and blood glucose, about one in three women and about one in five men age 35 and older has elevated blood pressure and roughly one in ten has elevated blood glucose, an indication of diabetes. Cancer is the sixth leading cause of death in Bangladesh, accounting for more than 150,000 deaths annually. Nevertheless, Bangladesh faces major health challenges. The national population is projected to grow to between 200 to 225 million over the next four decades. While fertility has declined, women have on average 2.3 children, and only about half use modern and effective contraceptive methods. Despite improvements in maternal health, Bangladesh still ranks in the bottom fourth of countries worldwide with approximately 240 deaths per 100,000 live births. Only one-in-four births takes place in a health care facility, putting both mothers and babies at risk. Although infant and child mortality is decreasing, poor nutrition is a critical health problem in Bangladesh. About half of children age 6-59 months suffers from anemia; four-in-ten are stunted; and one in three is underweight. Bangladesh has one of the worst burdens of childhood malnutrition in the world. In Bangladesh, close to 50 per cent of children under-five are stunted due to poor nutrition. It is reducing Bangladeshs chances of reaching its goal of achieving middle income country status by 2021 and is preventing millions of children from reaching their potential. According to UNICEF Bangladesh, malnutrition is caused by multiple factors.

The need for blood transfusion may arise at any time in both urban and rural areas. The unavailability of blood has led to deaths and many patients suffering from ill-health. Around 107 million units of blood donations are collected globally every year. Nearly 50% of these blood donations are collected in high-income countries, home to 15% of the world’s population. An adequate and reliable supply of safe blood can be assured by a stable base of regular, voluntary, unpaid blood donors. Regular, voluntary, unpaid blood donors are also the safest group of donors as the prevalence of bloodborne infections is lowest among these donors. Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health Many patients requiring transfusion, however, do not have timely access to safe blood and blood products. Every country needs to ensure that supplies of blood and blood products are sufficient and free from HIV, hepatitis viruses and other infections that can be transmitted through transfusion. Transfusions are used to support various treatments In high-income countries, the most frequently transfused patient group is over 65 years of age, accounting for up to 76% of all transfusions. The transfusion is most commonly used for supportive care in cardiovascular surgery, transplant surgery, massive trauma, and therapy for solid and haematological malignancies. In low- and middle-income countries it is used more often for management of pregnancy-related complications, childhood malaria complicated by severe anaemia, and trauma-related injuries. Adequate supply of safe blood can only be assured through regular voluntary unpaid donation Adequate and reliable supply of safe blood can only be assured through a stable base of regular, voluntary, unpaid blood donors. They are the safest group of donors because the prevalence of bloodborne infections is lowest among them. WHO urges Member States to develop national blood systems based on voluntary, unpaid blood donations to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency in safe blood and blood products. Voluntary unpaid donors account for 100% of blood supplies in 60 countries In 2012, 73 countries reported collecting more than 90% of their blood supply from voluntary, unpaid blood donors, among them 60 countries collect 100% of blood supply from voluntary unpaid blood donors. But in 72 countries, less than 50% of blood supplies come from voluntary unpaid donors, with much of their blood supply still dependent on family/ replacement and paid blood donors. Around 108 million blood donations are collected globally every year About 50% of these are donated in low- and middle-income countries where nearly 80% of the world’s population lives. The average blood donation rate is more than 9 times greater in high-income countries than in low-income countries. Collections at blood centres vary according to income group About 10 000 blood centres in 168 countries report collecting a total of 83 million blood donations. The median annual blood donations per centre is 15 000 in high-income countries, as compared to 3100 in middle- and low-income countries. More people in high-income countries donate blood than in other countries The median blood donation rate in high-income countries is 36.8 donations per 1000 people. This compares with 11.7 donations per 1000 people in middle-income countries and 3.9 donations in low-income countries. Donated blood should always be screened All donated blood should always be screened for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis prior to transfusion. Yet 25 countries are not able to screen all donated blood for one or more of these infections. Testing is not reliable in many countries because of staff shortages, poor quality test kits, irregular supplies, or lack of basic quality in laboratories. A single unit of blood can benefit several patients Separating blood into its various components allows a single unit of blood to benefit several patients and provides a patient only the blood component which is needed. About 95% of the blood collected in high-income countries, 80% in middle-income countries and 45% in low-income countries is separated into blood components. Unnecessary transfusions expose patients to needless risk Often transfusions are prescribed when simple and safe alternative treatments might be equally effective. As a result such a transfusion may not be necessary. An unnecessary transfusion exposes patients to the risk of infections such as HIV and hepatitis and adverse transfusion reactions.",{},"['countries', 'voluntary', 'safe', 'donors', 'donations', 'highincome', 'transfusion', 'blood', 'facts', 'unpaid', 'supply']","Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood.

They stated that the universal access is a commitment to scale up access to health rights, HIV treatment, prevention, care and support with the cooperation from government development partners and civil society. Terming the rights-based responses to the population as practical and effective they observed that universal access will never be achieved without ensuring human rights because human rights violations increase social marginalisation and risk of sexual transmitted diseases. In his presentation, Moshiur Rahman mentioned that the stigma and negative attitude towards the vulnerable population remained as main challenges to prevent the HIV/AIDS. Exploring ideas and developing stories Akhil Podder underscored the need for substantial and sustainable reduction of the existing human rights violation.

However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. Women who have been physically or sexually abused by their partners are more than twice as likely to have an abortion, almost twice as likely to experience depression, and in some regions, 1.5 times more likely to acquire HIV, as compared to women who have not experienced partner violence. Although little data is available—and great variation in how psychological violence is measured across countries and cultures—existing evidence shows high prevalence rates. Forty-three per cent of women in the 28 European Union Member States have experienced some form of psychological violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. It is estimated that of all women who were the victims of homicide globally in 2012, almost half were killed by intimate partners or family members, compared to less than six per cent of men killed in the same year. In 2012, a study conducted in New Delhi found that 92 per cent of women reported having experienced some form of sexual violence in public spaces in their lifetime, and 88 per cent of women reported having experienced some form of verbal sexual harassment (including unwelcome comments of a sexual nature, whistling, leering or making obscene gestures) in their lifetime. Worldwide, more than 700 million women alive today were married as children (below 18 years of age). Of those women, more than 1 in 3—or some 250 million—were married before 15. Child brides are often unable to effectively negotiate safe sex, leaving them vulnerable to early pregnancy as well as sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Around 120 million girls worldwide (slightly more than 1 in 10) have experienced forced intercourse or other forced sexual acts at some point in their lives. By far the most common perpetrators of sexual violence against girls are current or former husbands, partners or boyfriends. At least 200 million women and girls alive today have undergone female genital mutilation/cutting in 30 countries, according to new estimates published on the United Nations’ International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation in 2016. In most of these countries, the majority of girls were cut before age 5. Adult women account for almost half of all human trafficking victims detected globally. Women and girls together account for about 70 per cent, with girls representing two out of every three child trafficking victims. One in 10 women in the European Union report having experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15 (including having received unwanted, offensive sexually explicit emails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on social networking sites). The risk is highest among young women between 18 and 29 years of age. An estimated 246 million girls and boys experience school-related violence every year and one in four girls say that they never feel comfortable using school latrines, according to a survey on youth conducted across four regions. The extent and forms of school-related violence that girls and boys experience differ, but evidence suggests that girls are at greater risk of sexual violence, harassment and exploitation. In addition to the resulting adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences, school-related gender-based violence is a major obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls. Measures to address violence In the majority of countries with available data, less than 40 per cent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort. Among women who do, most look to family and friends and very few look to formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than 10 per cent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police. At least 119 countries have passed laws on domestic violence, 125 have laws on sexual harassment and 52 have laws on marital rape. However, even when laws exist, this does not mean they are always compliant with international standards and recommendations or implemented. Availability of data on violence against women has increased significantly in recent years. Since 1995, more than 100 countries have conducted at least one survey addressing the issue. Forty-four countries undertook a survey in the period between 1995 and 2004, and 89 countries did so in the period between 2005 and 2014, suggesting growing interest in this issue. More than 40 countries conducted at least two surveys in the period between 1995 and 2014, which means that, depending on the comparability of the surveys, changes over time could be analysed. Violence among vulnerable groups Evidence suggests that certain characteristics of women, such as sexual orientation, disability status or ethnicity, and some contextual factors, such as humanitarian crises, including conflict and post-conflict situations, may increase women’s vulnerability to violence. In 2014, 23 per cent of non-heterosexual women (those who identified their sexual orientation as lesbian, bisexual or other) interviewed in the European Union indicated having experienced physical and/or sexual violence by both male and female non-partner perpetrators, compared with five per cent of heterosexual women. Also, 34 per cent of women with a health problem or disability reported having experienced any physical or sexual violence by a partner in their lifetime, compared to 19 per cent of women without a health problem or disability, also based on data from the European Union. Source: UN WOMEN",{},"['sexual', 'countries', 'having', 'figures', 'violence', 'women', 'girls', 'experienced', 'ending', 'facts', 'cent', 'partner', 'experience']","It is estimated that 35 per cent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or sexual violence by a non-partner at some point in their lives. However, some national studies show that up to 70 per cent of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime. By far the most common perpetrators of sexual violence against girls are current or former husbands, partners or boyfriends. The extent and forms of school-related violence that girls and boys experience differ, but evidence suggests that girls are at greater risk of sexual violence, harassment and exploitation. Less than 10 per cent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police.",http://m.theindependentbd.com/arcprint/details/69237/2016-11-21

According the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, chronic kidney disease was ranked 27th in the list of causes of total number of deaths worldwide in 1990, but rose to 18th in 2010. This degree of movement up the list was second only to that for HIV and AIDs. Over 2 million people worldwide currently receive treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant to stay alive, yet this number may only represent 10% of people who actually need treatment to live. Of the 2 million people who receive treatment for kidney failure, the majority are treated in only five countries – the United States, Japan, Germany, Brazil, and Italy. These five countries represent only 12% of the world population. Only 20% are treated in about 100 developing countries that make up over 50% of the world population. More than 80% of all patients who receive treatment for kidney failure are in affluent countries with universal access to health care and large elderly populations. It is estimated that number of cases of kidney failure will increase disproportionately in developing countries, such as China and India, where the number of elderly people are increasing. In middle-income countries, treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation creates a huge financial burden for the majority of the people who need it. In another 112 countries, many people cannot afford treatment at all, resulting in the death of over 1 million people annually from untreated kidney failure. In the US, treatment of chronic kidney disease is likely to exceed $48 billion per year. Treatment for kidney failure consumes 6.7% of the total Medicare budget to care for less than 1% of the covered population. In China, the economy will lose US$558 billion over the next decade due to effects on death and disability attributable to heart disease and kidney disease. In Uruguay, the annual cost of dialysis is close to $ US 23 million, representing 30% of the budget of the National Resources Fund for specialized therapies. In England, according to a recent report published by NHS Kidney Care, chronic kidney disease costs more than breast, lung, colon and skin cancer combined. In Australia, treatment for all current and new cases of kidney failure through 2020 will cost an estimated $12 billion. In people aged 65 through 74 worldwide, it is estimated that one in five men, and one in four women, have CKD. Noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, diabetes, or kidney disease) have replaced communicable diseases (such as influence, malaria, or AIDs) as the most common causes of premature death worldwide. An estimated 80% of this burden occurs in low- or middle-income countries, and 25% is in people younger than 60 years. Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide health crisis. For example, in the year 2005, there were approximately 58 million deaths worldwide, with 35 million attributed to chronic disease, according to the World Health Organization. Chronic kidney disease can be treated. With early diagnosis and treatment, its possible to slow or stop the progression of kidney disease.",{},"['countries', 'worldwide', 'chronic', 'failure', 'number', 'estimated', 'facts', 'treatment', 'million', 'disease', 'global', 'kidney']","According the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, chronic kidney disease was ranked 27th in the list of causes of total number of deaths worldwide in 1990, but rose to 18th in 2010.

The infection may be in one or both of your lungs and it can be caused by bacteria or a virus. Anyone at any age can get pneumonia, but it can be particularly serious and even life threatening in babies, young children, older people and people with other illnesses who may have weakened lungs or immune systems as a result (e.g. people with asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV or type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes). Symptoms: The common symptoms of pneumonia include: a cough, which can be dry, or may produce thick mucus fever (a temperature of 38.5°C or higher), sweating and shivering chest pain breathing problems (e.g. breathlessness) feeling generally unwell loss of appetite. Your cough may last for 2–3 weeks after your infection has cleared up. Some people may also experience: headaches coughing up blood or blood-stained mucus nausea vomiting muscle and joint pain tiredness confusion and disorientation (mainly in older people). Pneumonia can share some of the symptoms of a cold, acute bronchitis and asthma. If your doctor thinks you have pneumonia, you may need to have a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis. Find out more about how pneumonia is diagnosed. Children and adults who are at increased risk of pneumonia will need antibiotic treatment and possibly hospitalisation as they are more likely to have severe illness and to develop other complications. Prevention: There are some very simple things you can do to avoid catching a respiratory tract infection (RTI) or spreading the infection to others if you do have one. Stay at home if you are unwell: If you have a cold, flu (influenza), pneumonia or any respiratory tract infection (RTI) — see your doctor if necessary and stay at home until you feel better. This helps you to get over the infection faster, and will also mean that you won’t come into contact with others and spread your infection. Simple ways to stop the spread of infection Help to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by: regularly washing your hands with soap and running water, particularly before preparing and eating food and after coughing or blowing your nose coughing and sneezing into a tissue then throwing it away covering your mouth when sneezing or coughing keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth avoiding sharing cups, glasses and cutlery when eating or drinking Keeping your household surfaces clean. Vaccination There are vaccines available called the pneumococcal vaccines — that can help protect children and adults against the bacteria that cause pneumonia, meningitis and many other serious illnesses (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Being vaccinated not only protects you from infection (i.e. makes you immune to the disease), but also protects the community as a whole, by reducing the number of people who can catch the infections and pass them on to others. This is called ‘herd immunity’. Who is the pneumococcal vaccine recommended for? Vaccination with a pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults and children for whom catching pneumonia would be very serious and even life threatening, including: all adults who are 65 years or older people with kidney failure people who have had an organ transplant people who have had their spleen removed, or who have a spleen that doesn’t function properly people who are HIV positive people with certain cancers that affect the immune system (including myeloma, lymphoma, Hodgkins disease) people with long-term illnesses including type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, alcohol dependence, heart, kidney or lung disease people who smoke.(Reprint) Courtesy: AsiaMed Connect in partnership with Apollo Hospitals",{},"['spread', 'adults', 'immune', 'diabetes', 'management', 'pneumococcal', 'illnesses', 'pneumonia', 'serious', 'type', 'infection']","Pneumonia is an inflammation of your lung tissue that is caused by an infection. people with asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV or type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes).

Photo: AP A leader of an international conference on gene editing said Wednesday that the work of a Chinese scientist who claims to have helped make the worlds first gene-edited babies showed a failure of self-regulation among scientists. Nobel laureate David Baltimore said the work of the scientist who made the claim would ""be considered irresponsible"" because it did not meet criteria many scientists agreed on several years ago before gene editing could be considered. Baltimore spoke at an international conference in Hong Kong, where the Chinese scientist, He Jiankui (HEH JEE-ahn-qway) of Shenzhen, made his first public comments since his work was revealed. He said the twin girls were born this month. He said they were conceived to try to help them resist possible future infection with the AIDS virus. Baltimore said he didnt think that was medically necessary. He said the case showed ""there has been a failure of self-regulation by the scientific community"" and said the conference committee would meet and issue a statement on Thursday about the future of the field. Another prominent American scientist speaking at the conference, Harvard Medical School dean Dr. George Daley, warned against a backlash to Hes claim. Daley said it would be unfortunate if a misstep with a first case led scientists and regulators to reject the good that could come from altering DNA to treat or prevent diseases. He has said his lab used the powerful gene-editing tool CRISPR to alter the DNA of human embryos. There is not yet independent confirmation of his claim, but scientists and regulators have been swift to condemn the experiment as unethical and unscientific. The National Health Commission has ordered local officials in Guangdong province to investigate Hes actions, and his employer, Southern University of Science and Technology, is investigating as well. The Chinese researcher said he practiced editing mice, monkey and human embryos in the lab for several years and has applied for patents on his methods. He said he chose embryo gene editing for HIV because these infections are a big problem in China. He sought to disable a gene called CCR5 that forms a protein doorway that allows HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to enter a cell.

widespread | theindependentbd.com","The millions of Americans caught in the grip of an addiction to opioids -- prescription painkillers or heroin -- remained the leading health news story of the past year. The scourge is now so widespread that, just last week, research suggested that deaths from opioid overdoses may be the biggest factor driving a decline in overall US life expectancy. If the trend holds, ""we could have more than two years of declining life expectancy in a row, which we havent seen since the influenza pandemic of 1918,"" said Bob Anderson, a statistician at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recently released the 2016 data. Overall, 63,600 Americans -- many in young adulthood or middle age -- died from an opioid overdose in 2016. Thats higher than the 40,000 annual deaths lost to AIDS at the height of the 1990s HIV crisis. The advent of extremely powerful opioids such as fentanyl is only compounding the problem, experts say. But a turnaround is possible. ""Its important to remember these deaths are preventable,"" said Lindsey Vuolo, associate director of health law and policy with the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. ""If we start treating addiction the way we treat other diseases, with a health-based approach funded at a level commensurate with the size and scope of the problem, we will overcome this crisis,"" Vuolo told HealthDay. In other health news, Trump administration efforts to repeal and replace the controversial health reform law known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) -- or ""Obamacare"" -- also dominated headlines in 2017. But holdouts from both the moderate and far right of the political spectrum doomed such efforts in the House and Senate, despite repeated attempts from the White House to push legislation through. However, just before Christmas Congress dealt a blow to the program, as the elimination of the ACAs so-called ""individual mandate"" became part of major tax reform. The individual mandate forced healthy-but-uninsured Americans to join ACA insurance pools or face a fine. Many experts believe the mandate is crucial to the financial health of Obamacare. In other news, the exposure and disgrace of men such as movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, TV personalities Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose, and others in the world of entertainment and politics, brought the age-old scourge of sexual harassment in the workplace out from the shadows. Legions of empowered female (and some male) victims joined the ranks of the #MeToo movement, perhaps hailing a turnaround in societys tolerance for these physically and mentally assaultive behaviors. Medical science made strides in 2017, too, with the first three approvals of gene-based therapies by the US Food and Drug Administration. In August, the agency approved Kymriah, a treatment that tweaks an aberrant gene responsible for a form of the blood cancer acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At the time, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the advent and approval of these life-saving therapies will ""change the face of modern medicine and drug development. Gene therapy products are now being studied in many diseases and conditions, including genetic disorders, autoimmune diseases, heart disease, cancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS."" Since then, two more gene therapies -- one against a rare eye disease and another against a form of lymphoma -- have received FDA approval. Forget to take your meds? This year the FDA also approved the first of what could be many ""digital pills"" -- medicines designed to alert patients and doctors if and when they have been taken. Abilify MyCite, the newly approved drug, is meant for patients with schizophrenia and depression, where medication compliance is often key to successful treatment. The pill contains a sensor that can send messages to devices such as smartphones to relay information on whether or not its been taken.

 | theindependentbd.com","Noted social scientist Profulla C Sarker has recently published a book, titled ‘Socio-cultural parameters of health and diseases’. The research-based work, published by Mothers Publications, provides a real scenario on traditional customs, culture of pluralism, maternal, child and mental health, human development, arsenicosis, ecological adaptation of people, community medicine, ethno-medicine, infertility, HIV/AIDS, gender inequality, food security and nutrional status of women and children. In 16 chapters, the writer in easy language covers areas of sociology, anthropology, public health, environmental science, social demography and development studies. The author discusses different dimensions of health _ physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, social, spiritual and environmental _ and their interconnection. The relationship between social and environmental health can sometimes affect our physical health (cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive and nervous system), and mental health (feelings, behaviour, psychological challenge of life). In addition, intellectual health has a capacity to solve the other problems. The slim volume highlights that health and diseases are not only related to biological factors, but also to culture, economic ability and psycho-social behaviour of people. As a result, alternative treatment systems are popular in countries like Bangladesh, India and China. The writer mentions traditional treatments available in developing countries like kabiraji (herbal medicine), and religious practitioners like ojhas who are consulted for snake bites. There are also people who use native plants to cure diseases, like sajna (moringa) for blood pressure, telakucha for diabetes, papaya for liver diseases, datura for skin conditions and pineapple for fevers. Moreover, infertile couples, who may face socio-economic problems like old-age insecurity, often turn to traditional or herbal medicines for a cure, he adds. Sarker provides real evidence of progress in mother and child health, and how a mother’s food habit determines her child’s health status. He explains food security and nutritional status of women and children. Illiteracy, fewer calories, iodine deficiency, and use of chemicals in crops may affect a mother’s health and affect a child’s height, weight, morbidity, etc. Though there are some effects of vaccination on a mother’s health, if a pregnant woman takes nutritious food timely, the child would be free from diseases like measles, tuberculosis, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and whooping cough. The writer also discusses maternal mortality due to obstetric complications and infections, and lack of antenatal care. The impacts of marriage between cousins are also discussed here. Through gene mutation and kinship network systems, children of consanguineous married couples can be affected by genetic disorders like mongolism, haemophilia and galactosaemia. The writer explores the importance of rainwater harvesting in rural areas to reduce arsenicosis, or arsenic poisoning from drinking tainted ground water. Hygiene practices are also essential for human health, and the writer suggests that village development committees can be very effective in that area, with the cooperation of government, private and non-government sectors. The book addresses physical and psychological effects of lathyrism, and rehabilitation criteria. Lathyrism is a debilitating neurotoxic disease that results from consuming certain legumes like chick peas or khesari. The author also argues that gender inequality, human trafficking, sexual abuse and erratic lifestyles can spread sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS, Apart from that, the writer identifies causes and consequences of child abuse in our society. As causes, he lists ineffective law and order, impunity of perpetrators, patriarchal society, etc, while consequences may include anger, depression, isolation, suicidal thoughts and insecurity. Finally, it is expected that the book, a collection of ‘inclusive thoughts’, would be useful to policymakers, planners, researchers, practitioners and students.

Infectious diseases,,,,,"Infectious diseases WHO Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi; the diseases can be spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another. Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of animals that can cause disease when transmitted to humans. What is TB? How does it spread? How is it treated? Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable. TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected. About one-third of the worlds population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with disease and cannot transmit the disease. People infected with TB bacteria have a lifetime risk of falling ill with TB of 10%. However persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill. When a person develops active TB (disease), the symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss etc.) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People ill with TB can infect up to 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. Without proper treatment up to two thirds of people ill with TB will die. Since 2000, 53 million lives have been saved through effective diagnosis and treatment. Active, drug-sensitive TB disease is treated with a standard 6-month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs that are provided with information, supervision and support to the patient by a health worker or trained volunteer. The vast majority of TB cases can be cured when medicines are provided and taken properly. What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and how do we control it? The bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) can develop resistance to the antimicrobial drugs used to cure the disease. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is TB that does not respond to at least isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful anti-TB drugs. The 2 reasons why multidrug resistance continues to emerge and spread are mismanagement of TB treatment and person-to-person transmission. Most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed, 6-month drug regimen that is provided to patients with support and supervision. Inappropriate or incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs, or use of ineffective formulations of drugs (such as use of single drugs, poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions), and premature treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and hospitals. In some countries, it is becoming increasingly difficult to treat MDR-TB. Treatment options are limited and expensive, recommended medicines are not always available, and patients experience many adverse effects from the drugs. In some cases even more severe drug-resistant TB may develop. Extensively drug-resistant TB, XDR-TB, is a form of multidrug-resistant TB with additional resistance to more anti-TB drugs that therefore responds to even fewer available medicines. It has been reported in 117 countries worldwide. Drug resistance can be detected using special laboratory tests which test the bacteria for sensitivity to the drugs or detect resistance patterns. These tests can be molecular in type (such as Xpert MTB/RIF) or else culture-based. Molecular techniques can provide results within hours and have been successfully implemented even in low resource settings. New WHO recommendations aim to speed up detection and improve treatment outcomes for MDR-TB through use of a novel rapid diagnostic test and a shorter, cheaper treatment regimen. At less than US$ 1000 per patient, the new treatment regimen can be completed in 9–12 months. Not only is it less expensive than current regimens, but it is also expected to improve outcomes and potentially decrease deaths due to better adherence to treatment and reduced loss to follow-up. Solutions to control drug-resistant TB are to: cure the TB patient the first time around provide access to diagnosis ensure adequate infection control in facilities where patients are treated ensure the appropriate use of recommended second-line drugs. In 2016, an estimated 490 000 people worldwide developed MDR-TB, and an additional 110 000 people with rifampicin-resistant TB were also newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment. The countries with the largest numbers of MDR/RR-TB cases (47% of the global total) were China, India and the Russian Federation. It is estimated that about 6.2% of these cases were XDR-TB. Polio is a disease you read about in history books. Does it still exist? Is it curable? Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases to 22 reported cases in 2017. This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease. Today, only 3 countries in the world have never stopped transmission of polio (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria). Despite the progress achieved since 1988, as long as a single child remains infected with poliovirus, children in all countries are at risk of contracting the disease. The poliovirus can easily be imported into a polio-free country and can spread rapidly amongst unimmunized populations. Failure to eradicate polio could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world. There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus interferes with the functions of the liver and causes pathological damage. A small percentage of infected people cannot get rid of the virus and become chronically infected – these people are at higher risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. How do you get hepatitis B? HBV is spread by contact with blood or body fluids of an infected person – the same way as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, HBV is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV. The main ways of getting infected with HBV are: from mother to baby at the birth (perinatal) from child-to-child unsafe injections and transfusions unprotected sexual contact. Worldwide, most infections occur from mother-to-child, from child-to-child (especially in household settings), and from reuse of unsterilized needles and syringes. Before the widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine, almost all children in developing countries used to become infected with the virus. How is Hepatitis B NOT spread? Hepatitis B virus is NOT spread by sharing eating utensils, breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, sneezing or by recreational use of public pools or the like. How can I protect myself? You can protect yourself against hepatitis B by being vaccinated. The hepatitis B vaccine has an outstanding record of safety and effectiveness, and since 1982, over 1 billion doses have been used worldwide. The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing chronic infections from developing. Protection lasts for 20 years at least, no booster is recommended by WHO as of today. What is vaccine-derived polio? Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out. On rare occasions, if a population is seriously under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for an extended period of time. The longer it is allowed to survive, the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse – this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses. Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases. Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the risk of cases of cVDPV2. The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. Well over 10 million cases have been averted since large-scale administration of OPV began 20 years ago. Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of the virus. Do all mosquitoes transmit malaria? Only certain species of mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus—and only females of those species—can transmit malaria. Malaria is caused by a one-celled parasite called a Plasmodium. Female Anopheles mosquitoes pick up the parasite from infected people when they bite to obtain blood needed to nurture their eggs. Inside the mosquito the parasites reproduce and develop. When the mosquito bites again, the parasites contained in the salivary gland are injected and pass into the blood of the person being bitten. Malaria parasites multiply rapidly in the liver and then in red blood cells of the infected person. One to two weeks after a person is infected the first symptoms of malaria appear: usually fever, headache, chills and vomiting. If not treated promptly with effective medicines, malaria can kill by infecting and destroying red blood cells and by clogging the capillaries that carry blood to the brain or other vital organs. There are four types of human malaria: Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. P. vivaxand P. falciparum are the most common forms. Falciparum malaria—the most deadly type—is most common in sub-Saharan Africa, where it causes more than 400 000 deaths a year. In recent years, some human cases of malaria have also occurred with Plasmodium knowlesi – a species that causes malaria among monkeys and occurs in certain forested areas of South-East Asia. What is dengue and how is it treated? Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected female Aedes mosquito. There are four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Symptoms appear in 3–14 days (average 4–7 days) after the infective bite. Dengue fever is a flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults. There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication but early clinical diagnosis and careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses often save lives. More than 70% of the disease burden is in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the incidence and severity of disease have increased rapidly in recent years. The African and Eastern Mediterranean regions have also recorded more outbreaks of the disease in the last ten years. Since 2010 indigenous transmission of dengue has also been reported in Europe. Urbanization, rapid movement of people and goods, favorable climatic conditions and lack of trained staff have all contributed to the global increase of dengue.",{},"['infected', 'polio', 'spread', 'disease', 'person', 'cases', 'opv', 'drugs', 'tb', 'diseases', 'treatment', 'infectious']","Infectious diseasesWHOInfectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi; the diseases can be spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another.

"Addiction could stem from ancient retrovirus, study suggests",,,,,"Addiction could stem from ancient retrovirus, study suggests Independent Online Desk An ancient retrovirus that predates modern humans may explain why people suffer from addiction, scientists have said. Researchers studied drug users in two cities and found they were up to about three times more likely than the general population to have remnants of the HK2 virus within a particular gene in their DNA.The virus dates back at least to Neanderthals and is present in the RASGRF2 gene — which a researcher called the “pleasure gene” because it increases the activity of dopamine in the brain — in about 5% to 10% of people. That proportion of the population could therefore be more disposed to addictive behavior, the scientists said. The team, from the universities of Oxford and Athens, found the virus in 34% of drug users tested in Glasgow, Scotland, compared to 9.5% of the local population, and in 14% of Greek patients, compared to 6% of that country’s population. Retroviruses are viruses that have the capacity to inject their DNA into the genome of the host. This is the third time they have been strongly linked with a harmful effect in humans, after the discoveries of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), according to the researchers. HK2 is present in all humans, but appears in the RASGRF2 gene in up to one in 10 people. The study suggests that these people “could be prone to any sort of addictive behavior, even beneficial in some sense,” Gkikas Magiorkinis of the University of Athens told CNN. The same gene was linked to binge-drinking in an earlier study in 2012. And the researchers said that studying the rarely analyzed, “dark” part of the genome that they looked at “will unlock more genomic secrets.” “Human endogenous retroviruses comprise 8% of the genome and have not been linked with human disease until now,” Magiorkinis said. “I believe that a significant part of this unexplained disease diversity will be understood by studying this difficult-to-understand ‘dark’ genome,” he added.",{},"['studying', 'suggests', 'study', 'retrovirus', 'humans', 'gene', 'users', 'human', 'addiction', 'virus', 'genome', 'stem', 'linked', 'ancient', 'population']","Addiction could stem from ancient retrovirus, study suggestsIndependent Online DeskAn ancient retrovirus that predates modern humans may explain why people suffer from addiction, scientists have said.
