Number of HIV/AIDS cases continues to fall,"The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Việt Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health.",[],2018-12-03,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY– The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Việt Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health. Minister of Health Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến, however, said that more than 8,000 new HIV cases were detected every year. ""Between 3,000 and 4,000 people die due to AIDS each year,"" Tiến said at a meeting held last Saturday to respond to World AIDS Day and the 2018 national action month on HIV/AIDS prevention (November 11 to December 12). ""The country has nearly 50,000 people with HIV in the community, but does not know their status. These are challenges which we still face,” Tiến said. The rate of HIV infection among users who inject drugs, especially among youth, has seen an upward trend, according to the ministry. The shortage of capital for HIV/AIDS prevention is one of many challenges as the coverage of preventive and treatment services remains limited. Discrimination against people with HIV also continues. “HIV/AIDS could break out again if we ignore prevention or have irrational attitudes,” Tiến said. Mary Tarnowka, US Consul General, said that through the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the US government had invested over $800 million to support the HIV/AIDS response in Việt Nam. Nearly 80,000 people with HIV/AIDS, including more than 2,800 children, had been given life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. “Việt Nam has shown global leadership by making the HIV response sustainable through the social health insurance platform. Valued at nearly $6 million, social health insurance’s first ARV procurement will cover medication for 33 per cent of all ARV treatment patients in 2019,” she said. Last Friday, the Ministry of Health, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and global health non-profit organization PATH launched pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services for HIV prevention. PrEP is a way for people, who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of contracting it, to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day as part of a combination HIV prevention strategy. If someone who is on PrEP is exposed to HIV, the medication can work to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection. PrEP is extremely effective when taken correctly, and can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 92 per cent or more. The scaling up of PrEP is essential to Việt Nam being able to dramatically bend down the curve of new HIV infections, according to the press release from the US Consulate. Dr. Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of Vietnam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control, said: “We’re proud that Việt Nam is the second country in Asia, after Thailand, to roll out PrEP nationwide.” “PrEP will be made available in 11 provinces by 2020. With a target of 7,300 people enrolled, we aim to provide these services to all those who need them nationwide,” Long said. VAAC, USAID, and PATH launched pilot PrEP services in June 2017 through the USAID/PATH Healthy Markets project. Healthy Markets has worked with community groups led by people at risk of HIV, provincial health leaders, private sector partners, and private and public outpatient clinics to provide PrEP for 1,895 people at risk of HIV in HCM City and Hà Nội. This includes men who have sex with men, transgender women, and HIV-negative partners of people living with HIV who are not viral load suppressed. PrEP was also made available through a pilot project run by UNAIDS. The USAID/PATH Healthy Markets project has also worked with the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNAIDS and PEPFAR partners to support VAAC to develop a comprehensive package of national policies, guidelines and training materials that will support the scaling up of PrEP. – VNS",Society,"['cases', 'number', 'prep', 'services', 'việt', 'nam', 'fall', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'prevention', 'risk', 'continues', 'health', 'tiến']","HCM CITY– The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Việt Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health.

HIV increase sparks free tests,The Ministry of Health has asked the northern province of Phú Thọ to conduct HIV/AIDS tests free of charge for local people in Kim Thượng Commune and those living in surrounding areas.,[],2018-08-17,vietnamnews.vn,"A delegation from the health ministry visits residents in Kim Thượng Commune to inspect HIV/AIDS situation in the area. — VNA/VNS Photo Trung Kiên PHÚ THỌ — The Ministry of Health has asked the northern province of Phú Thọ to conduct HIV/AIDS tests free of charge for local people in Kim Thượng Commune and those living in surrounding areas. The move comes after an outbreak of HIV in Kim Thượng Commune, where 42 residents, including a 18-month-old baby girl, were found to be infected last month. These newly-recorded cases were among 500 residents were tested after two people died of HIV/AIDS disease and four newly-infected cases were reported between February and June. A private health clinic owner, which has been found to operate without permission, was suspected to have shared the same dirty needle to multiple patients, causing the medical disaster. The man denied the allegation. PhD Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of the Ministry of Health’s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said the number of infected people at Kim Thượng Commune was high - about 2.5 times higher than the average rate of the country. The situation was serious and immediate measures were needed to control the outbreak, Long said. He said the blood tests for HIV/AIDS infection was simple and could be conducted at patients’ homes or the communal health centre. Those who were found to be positive with the virus would be consulted, supported and given anti-retrovirus (ARV) medical treatment for free. In reply to suspicions on the possibility of HIV transmission by sharing the same needle, Long said based on the initial investigation, the source of infection in the commune could not be determined. HIV is a chronic disease and takes patients between five and seven years to experience the transition from HIV to AIDS. Among 42 infected patients, some of whom have full blown AIDS, a number visited the private health clinic six months ago. So, it was impossible to conclude the nurse practitioner was the one causing the HIV transmission to all these patients. In order to assess the HIV infection in the commune, the Ministry of Health has asked the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology to conduct a survey and investigate the causes of high transmission rate. However, the task could take several months to complete. It was necessary to consider comprehensive transmission routes and related factors, such as the number of local residents working as migrant labourers in other localities, the number of prostitutes and drug addicts. The task was assigned to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, in collaboration with the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, the World Health Organisation and related agencies in Phú Thọ Province. In addition, the provincial health sector should strengthen education to improve knowledge on HIV/AIDS prevention. Infected patients receiving ARV treatment could stay healthy and have long life. ARVs are provided free of charge at districts or communes’ health clinics. — VNS",Society,"['ministry', 'thượng', 'patients', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'sparks', 'residents', 'transmission', 'increase', 'number', 'free', 'tests', 'health', 'commune']","A delegation from the health ministry visits residents in Kim Thượng Commune to inspect HIV/AIDS situation in the area.

HIV testing and treatment for an AIDS-free world,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is spread through contaminated blood, unprotected sex, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Healthy skin and other bodily fluids like saliva and tears do not transmit HIV.",[],2018-06-25,vietnamnews.vn,"By Dr Mathieu Nalpas* The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is spread through contaminated blood, unprotected sex, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Healthy skin and other bodily fluids like saliva and tears do not transmit HIV. Six to 10 years after contamination and without treatment, HIV infection leads to AIDS and death by general failure of the immune system. Since antiretroviral therapy treatment became widely available in the late 90s, HIV has become a chronic infection. People on treatment do not die from AIDS anymore and are able to live with the virus for the rest of their lives. However, there is still no vaccine against the virus available today. Since 1981, the HIV epidemic killed 36 million people around the world. In 2016, the total number of infected people stood at 36 million people, while 1.2 million died and 1.8 million were newly infected. Despite these terrible numbers, there is hope for the near future. The end of HIV epidemic is possible to happen within the next few decades. In 2011, Scientists from Switzerland showed that persons living with HIV who were taking effective antiretroviral therapy were not contagious for their sexual partner. The so-called “treatment as prevention” concept became fundamental in the fight against HIV. Therefore, a new consensus emerged – the more people living with HIV will take treatment, the less contagious they will become and the less new contaminations will occur. A maximum of people who are living with HIV and who ignore there status must be tested. If they know they are HIV positive they are more unlikely to continue risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and unsafe intravenous drug injection, and they can access treatment There is strong evidence to show that if enough persons living with HIV know their status by being tested and if enough people get treated, the HIV epidemic could be stopped. It is based on this new hope that international HIV expert institutions have developed a new model of its goals called the 90-90-90 programme. The 90-90-90 programme aims to ensure that 90 per cent of people living with HIV are aware of their infection, 90 per cent of people who know about their infection are given treatment, and 90 per cent of individuals receiving treatment do not have detectable virus in their blood. If these goals are reached, the proportion of HIV-positive individuals who cannot infect others would increase immensely and the current epidemic would then be stopped, in the same way that the measles epidemic in young children was stopped through vaccination. A number of cases would still persist, but the scourge of AIDS would come to an end. Access to generalised HIV testing and treatment are fundamental in reaching that goal. In Việt Nam, where 260,000 persons live with HIV, the virus has become a public health threat. In addition to that figure, there were 11,000 new infections and 7,800 AIDS-related death in the country in 2016. According to the Ministry of Health, AIDS is one of the top 10 causes of death in Việt Nam. The majority of Vietnamese living with HIV are residents of large cities and mountainous areas. Drug use through injections is the main mode of transmission in Vietnam and the epidemic remains concentrated in some key population groups, including female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. These population groups face strong stigma and discrimination from their families and society in general, making access to screening and treatment a tough challenge for them. According to social research, recurrent barriers to HIV testing and treatment access in these populations include the dual stigmatisation of homosexuality, prostitution, and drug use with HIV/AIDS, as well as failure to protect patient confidentiality, difficulty for health providers to discuss certain issues such as sexual identity, lack of clear referral pathways and peer support, and low access to services in remote areas. In this context, HIV testing and disclosure of HIV status is often not an option for these persons. In 2014, Việt Nam was the first country in Asia to adopt and commit to the 90-90-90 target. The Vietnamese government has set a target where 90 per cent of people living with HIV must know their status, 90 per cent of people who know their HIV-positive status must be on treatment and 90 per cent of people on treatment must have undetectable virus in their blood. If this goal can finally be reached in the near future, it will mean the end of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Việt Nam. — Family Medical Practice * Dr. Mathieu Nalpas has been working at Family Medical Practice Ha Noi since 2016.

Localities to strengthen HIV/AIDS control and prevention,The Ministry of Health has asked provinces and cities to strengthen HIV/AIDS control and prevention activities as part of the Central Party Steering Committee’s goal of eliminating HIV/AIDS in the country by 2030.,[],2018-10-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — The Ministry of Health has asked provinces and cities to strengthen HIV/AIDS control and prevention activities as part of the Central Party Steering Committee’s goal of eliminating HIV/AIDS in the country by 2030. The health ministry asked localities to improve HIV preventive measures, especially distribution of syringes and condoms to high-risk groups like drug addicts and prostitutes. Methadone programmes will be maintained and expanded to treat drug addicts. Communication activities will strengthen the community’s awareness and eliminate stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS. To strengthen HIV supervision and detection activities, HIV consultation, test and screening forms will be diversified at medical facilities, community and households. HIV test programmes should be carried out at the district level in mountainous and remote and ethnic minority areas, especially residential clusters with many people living with HIV/AIDS. The health sector encouraged localities to also establish HIV test laboratories at the district level in remote and mountainous regions for early detection of new HIV cases in the area. The ARV treatment programme will be expanded widely as soon as possible to reach HIV carriers. HIV treatment facilities will be strengthened to meet the regulations of the health sector. The expense of ARV drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment will be covered by the health insurance fund from the beginning of 2019, according to the instruction. The ministry also suggested provinces and cities allocate more local budget for HIV/AIDS prevention and control with the goal of providing health insurance cards to all people living with HIV/AIDS. Human resources specialising in HIV/AIDS prevention should be maintained and strengthened for the establishment of the provincial and city disease control centres. The Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) director Hoàng Đình Cảnh said that HIV/AIDS epidemic is still widespread and with a high fatality rate. Việt Nam has about 10,000 new HIV cases and around 2,000 deaths by AIDS yearly. “The increasing number of drug addicts and prostitutes has made the epidemic situation more complicated and out of control.

Only 130,000 patients receive sustainable anti-virus (ARV) treatments. In the first six months of 2018, 3,500 new cases of HIV infection were found, more than 1,800 of which turned to AIDS. 814 HIV-positive people died. Compared to the same period last year, the number of new HIV infections, new AIDS patients and deaths from HIV decreased by 30 per cent, 27 per cent and two per cent, respectively.

For patients who do not have health insurance, they will continue to receive free medicine at health facilities where they are being treated, Dr Văn Hùng, the centre’s vice director, told Việt Nam News Agency. Forty health facilities that provide HIV treatment have signed contracts with the city-based Việt Nam Social Security to accept health insurance. These facilities belong to city- and district-level hospitals, as well as health centres’ community counselling and support divisions. Dr Nguyễn Trung Hòa, director of the Gò Vấp District Health Centre, said that it would be providing counselling and tests as well as treatment for people with HIV/AIDS. In the first quarter of the year, the centre conducted 14,981 examinations for people with HIV/AIDS, including 8,614 exams for people who had health insurance this year. The centre has provided antiretroviral drugs to 1,481 people with HIV. More than 1,300 people with HIV/AIDS treated at the centre have health insurance, accounting for 88.5 per cent of the total. Dr Kim Chi Na, head of the Health Centre in District 11’s community counselling and support division, said that it was now treating more than 2,700 people with HIV/AIDS. The division admits 70 new cases with HIV each month, Na said, adding that most of them are from other provinces. The division has only two doctors, but only one doctor is allowed to examine 65 people per day under national healthcare regulations. The division needs to employ more doctors so that it will comply with the regulation next year when it begins providing treatment to people with HIV/AIDS. However, because of a shortage of funds, more doctors cannot be hired, Na said. HCM City has one private general clinic, Galant, in District 5, to treat people with HIV/AIDS under health insurance coverage. Charity health facilities which provide treatment to people with HIV/AIDS have been upgraded to meet the insurance coverage criteria of the Việt Nam Social Security agency.

City takes steps to achieve UN 90-90-90 goals in HIV control,"An additional 2,430 people with HIV were diagnosed in the first six months of the year, an increase of 732 compared to the same period last year, according to the HCM City Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.",[],2018-09-05,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — An additional 2,430 people with HIV were diagnosed in the first six months of the year, an increase of 732 compared to the same period last year, according to the HCM City Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, the centre’s head, told Việt Nam News Agency that most of these people had had HIV for a rather long time, but had never been tested. In recent years, Việt Nam has enhanced screening and testing for high-risk people to achieve the UN’s 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020. Under the goals, by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. Ninety per cent of people with a diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, while 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. In the first half of the year, nearly 287,000 people were tested and 95 per cent of them were positive for HIV. They were brought to outpatient examination clinics in the city for treatment. “Detecting more people with HIV and taking them to the city’s treatment programmes is very important because many of them do not know their status and they are at a high risk of transmission to others. They are difficult to access. However, now many of them can be detected, so transmission should stop,” Vân told Việt Nam News Agency. The city has more than 40,000 people with HIV and nearly 10,000 have not yet been detected because agencies have not had access to them, she said. Dr Nguyễn Trung Hòa, director of the Preventive Health Centre in Gò Vấp District, told Sài Gòn Giải Phóng (Liberated Sài Gòn) newspaper that if people with HIV are detected early, they will receive antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in time and be able to live like healthy people. HCM City is one of 30 cities worldwide that were the first to commit to the UN 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020, she said. The US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is the US government’s response to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, has provided sponsorship for the city so that it could reach its goals quickly. The donated funds have been used for peers to access groups of high-risk people such as prostitutes and drug injectors, especially the group of men who have sex with men. It also has been used to buy rapid test kits for HIV detection and other activities related to HIV prevention and control. Moreover, the city’s agencies have expanded communication to reduce discrimination against people with HIV, Vân said. The city also will improve quality of preventive and treating services in order to ensure that people with HIV have opportunities for detection and treatment, she added. The city Department of Health has co-operated with the Centre for Reproductive Healthcare to carry out programmes on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV at 58 health facilities for pregnant women. In the first six months of the year, 44,500 pregnant women were provided counselling and testing. At least 93 per cent of pregnant women with HIV received ARV therapy, which helps prevent transmission of the virus to their baby. The women’s newborns also continue to receive treatment for mother-to-child transmission services. Challenges Currently, patients with HIV receive free treatment, but next year they will have to cover the costs as funding for treatment is drying up from international sources. Health insurance will cover the costs, but 10 per cent of these patients do not have health insurance. Vân said this was a challenge for the UN 90-90-90 goals. If no financial sponsorship can be found, the city will spend part of its budget to buy health insurance cards for people with HIV. Another challenge is the upward trend of HIV drug resistance among people with HIV, with the rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent who have HIV. The cost for treatment for people with HIV drug resistance is five or 10 times higher than normal treatment, Vân said, adding that non-adherence to treatment regimens results in resistance. To improve surveillance and treatment, the city plans to strengthen co-ordination with other neighbouring provinces and cities in HIV prevention and control to avoid losing contact with people with HIV. — VNS",Society,"['treatment', 'goals', 'city', 'vân', 'hiv', '909090', 'steps', 'takes', 'transmission', 'cent', 'prevention', 'control', 'achieve', 'health', 'therapy']","In recent years, Việt Nam has enhanced screening and testing for high-risk people to achieve the UN’s 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020.

Health ministry investigates HIV incident in Phú Thọ,Dozens of residents of a mountainous commune in the northern province of Phú Thọ fear they might have contracted HIV after receiving from a local doctor injections that were allegedly contaminated.,[],2018-08-13,vietnamnews.vn,"PHÚ THỌ — Dozens of residents of a mountainous commune in the northern province of Phú Thọ fear they may have contracted HIV after receiving allegedly contaminated injections at a private clinic. Residents of Kim Thượng Commune in Tân Sơn District will receive free screening and free HIV/AIDS treatment if they test positive, Dr Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy head of Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), said. Yesterday morning, a working group – including health ministry officials and doctors from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology – arrived at the scene to investigate and calm residents. Hà Kế San, vice chairman of Phú Thọ People’s Committee told the media that there were 42 HIV cases newly recorded at Kim Thượng Commune out of nearly 500 who underwent HIV testing after the rumours started. “The HIV/AIDS authority deemed the rate to be quite high in a population of 6,000, but not especially so, since there are at least 61 communes in the country with even higher rate of HIV/AIDS infection,” San said in a press conference held yesterday afternoon. San said it is still too early to determine the reason behind this high infection rate, but the health ministry has already started working on the case. “The most important point is to provide counselling and support for the unfortunate patients. We must ensure that the people are aware of the fact that there are now treatment methods for the disease, the Government-supplied anti-retrovirus ARV can enable a healthy long life,” San said. The counselling is supposed to be done first before telling the patients of their situation as well as treatment. “The investigation is not easy and needs a lot of time. Based on our previous experience in similar incidents, it will take as long as two months to arrive at a definitive conclusion,” Dr Cảnh told Vietnam News Agency. Kim Thượng is an underdeveloped locality, with Mường ethnicity people making up 85 per cent of the population. In recent weeks, the quiet commune descended into panic as several people needed to take HIV tests, after a middle-aged female tested positive for the virus. She said she had gone to the private residence of nurse-practitioner Hà Trần Thảo, who is currently working at Tân Sơn General Hospital, to get an injection. Rumours started circulating that Thảo might have reused dirty needles on multiple patients, resulting in the spread of infection, however, in a written statement, Thảo denied the allegations. The mass blood tests were part of a research on communicable and non-communicable diseases in the community conducted by Tân Sơn health clinic and not mass HIV tests, according to authorities. The results of the survey have not been publicly made available as they contain sensitive and private information. “Given the travelling difficulties and scattered clusters of residence in the commune, locals often opted to visit houses of doctors residing in the area instead of going to proper health clinics. The doctor in question is not licenced to operate a private clinic. But the cause is still needed to be studied,” Lê Quang Thọ, deputy head of Phú Thọ’s health department said, not ruling out the possibility that the patients themselves might have covered up their own risky behaviour or made false statements due to mental duress. — VNS",Society,"['ministry', 'investigates', 'patients', 'incident', 'working', 'private', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'tests', 'tho', 'tân', 'thảo', 'commune', 'health', 'phu']","PHÚ THỌ — Dozens of residents of a mountainous commune in the northern province of Phú Thọ fear they may have contracted HIV after receiving allegedly contaminated injections at a private clinic.

Đồng Nai Province makes it easier for people with HIV/AIDS to access treatment,People with HIV/AIDS in the south-eastern province of Đồng Nai who have public health insurance can now go to any medical facility for treatment without requiring a transfer order from their designated hospital.,[],2018-07-11,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — People with HIV/AIDS in the south-eastern province of Đồng Nai who have public health insurance can now go to any medical facility for treatment without requiring a transfer order from their designated hospital. Until now they could only go to the health facility registered in their health insurance card. If they wanted to go to other places including higher-level hospitals, they had to obtain a transfer order from the facility. The new system makes it easier for them to their hospital of choice, Dr Nguyễn Giỏi, deputy head of the province HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre, said. The province’s website cites the case of a woman from Vĩnh Cửu District who tested positive for HIV eight years ago and developed pneumonia and candidiasis and needed to go to a province-level hospital for treatment. It took a long time to get the transfer paper from the Biên Hòa city Preventive Health Centre, she complained. Two medical facilities, the province HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre and the Long Khánh town Health Centre, have yet to sign up for the new system with Việt Nam Social Security, but are expected to come on board this month. Dr Trương Văn Rạng, deputy head of the latter, said the centre has all the facilities needed to examine and treat people with HIV/AIDS. It now provides free ant-retroviral (ARV) drugs to 412 people with HIV/AIDS. Dr Nguyễn Thi Văn Văn, head of the Long Thành District Health Centre, said the ARV drugs are sponsored by the Global Fund and provided free. The Global Fund is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and people affected by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, designed to accelerate the end of the diseases as epidemics. Of 486 people with HIV treated at her centre, Văn said 112 do not have health insurance cards. The Ministry of Health has warned that if health facilities do not sign up with Việt Nam Social Security to cover HIV treatment for insured people, the province would have to cover the cost of ARV therapy for them and the Global Fund would stop its assistance from next year. Đồng Nai Province has seen a decrease in the incidence of new HIV cases in recent years from more than 300 in 2015 to 200 last year and 60 so far this year. But the incidence among men who have sex with men has increased sharply. As of the beginning of this month the province has issued for free health insurance cards to more than 2,600 people with HIV/AIDS. It is likely to issue another 300 soon. Its goal is to ensure everyone with the disease is covered by the beginning of next year.

HIV aid to be cut in 2017,Medical experts are concerned that many people with HIV in the country will be forced to drop their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment in 2017.,[],2015-08-22,vietnamnews.vn,"A HIV patient receives treatment at the 09 Hospital in Ha Noi. Medical experts say that many people with HIV in the country will drop their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment in 2017 when it will no longer be free. — VNS Photo Doan Tung HA NOI (VNS) — Medical experts are concerned that many people with HIV in the country will be forced to drop their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment in 2017. This is because international aid, which covers all medical fees for people with HIV, will cease, according to the Nong thon ngay nay (Countryside Today) newspaper. The funding stoppage will be fully introduced in 2017 because Viet Nam has now been classed as a middle-income country. Until then, international aid will cease for new cases. Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the Health Ministrys Administration of HIV/AIDS Control said ARV drugs could suppress the HIV virus, stop the progression of HIV and reduce HIV infections in the community. Long said about 98,000 people with HIV had received free ARV treatment in the country to date. He said it cost about VND420 billion (US$19 million) a year to treat 98,000 people with HIV. Thus, the cost for medical treatment fee for one person treated with ARV was about VND4 million (US$181) a year. In response to the situation, the health ministry has issued circular no 15/2015/TT-BYT saying that the health insurance agency will cover all costs for ARV treatment, but only for pregnant woman and children under the age of six with HIV. The circular added that from 2017, the agency would cover 80 to 95 per cent of medical fees for ARV treatment for other people. They will have to contribute about 5-20 per cent of total fees. Do Thi Nhan, head of the departments HIV/AIDS Examination and Care Office said that this was a significant effort by the national health sector. Grant support The US Agency for International Development (USAID) yesterday launched the Healthy Markets Innovation Fund to support innovative social enterprise ideas for HIV-related commodities and services in Viet Nam. The fund offers opportunities for organisations, non-profits, and businesses in Viet Nam to engage in HIV response by contributing and investing in innovative ideas to increase the supply of HIV goods and services. Promising ideas chosen by a panel of HIV and social impact experts will compete for award packages of financial and in-kind support, such as business mentoring and technical assistance for implementation. ""The Healthy Markets Innovation Fund is a new exciting opportunity to engage and support private sector and community entrepreneurs with enterprising ideas that can contribute to the HIV response,"" she said. The fund is implemented under the umbrella of Healthy Markets, a five-year project that aims to leverage private sector and social enterprise skills, resources, and innovation to contribute to a sustained HIV response for populations facing the greatest risks. About 80 per cent of funding for HIV response in Viet Nam comes from external donors. Domestic resources are declining as international donors withdraw from Viet Nam. Finding alternative sources to maintain the provision of HIV related goods and services is crucial. ""In the coming years, as Viet Nam looks for novel ways of sustaining the HIV response, it will need to reach out to new partners and find new methods of providing goods and services,"" said US Consul-General Rena Bitter. — VNS",Society,"['response', 'medical', 'aid', 'arv', 'international', '2017', 'hiv', 'nam', 'viet', 'cut', 'ideas', 'treatment', 'health']","Medical experts say that many people with HIV in the country will drop their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment in 2017 when it will no longer be free. — VNS Photo Doan TungHA NOI (VNS) — Medical experts are concerned that many people with HIV in the country will be forced to drop their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment in 2017.

"1,200 people take oral prophylaxis to reduce risk of HIV infection","Nearly 1,200 people at high risk of HIV have enrolled in a pilot oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programme in Việt Nam to reduce their risk of infection, according to the Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC).",[],2018-05-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — Nearly 1,200 people at high risk of HIV have enrolled in a pilot oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programme in Việt Nam to reduce their risk of infection, according to the Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC). PrEP is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs, which, if taken daily as prescribed, can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 92-99 per cent for people who are at high risk, including men who have sex with men, transgender women, and HIV-negative partners of those diagnosed with HIV. Since 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended the use of PrEP as part of a combination HIV prevention strategy that includes the use of condoms for people at substantial risk of HIV. Since March 2017, pilot interventions supported by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through USAID/PATH’s Healthy Markets project and the US Agency for International Development (AID) through the Centre for Applied Research for Men And Community Health have made PrEP available to men who have sex with men, transgender women, and HIV-negative partners of those diagnosed with HIV in HCM City and Hà Nội, according to Vũ Ngọc Bảo of USAID/PATH’s Healthy Markets project. These PrEP services are being provided by public outpatient clinics, private clinics and associated key population-led civil society organisations, Bảo said at a workshop reviewing the PrEP programme held yesterday in HCM City. Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of VAAC, said that results had enabled VAAC to collaborate with all partners to expand PrEP services, starting with 11 cities with a target of 5,610 PrEP clients by the end of 2019 and 7,300 by the end of 2020. “PrEP is a game-changer for Việt Nam in its efforts to achieve the 90-90-90 goals,” said Mei Mei Peng, deputy director of USAID’s Health Department. The numbers mean 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. USAID supports Việt Nam, the second country to adopt PrEP in Southeast Asia, to expand options for people at risk of HIV to protect themselves and work toward HIV elimination, she said. Methadone therapy Huỳnh Thanh Khiết, deputy director of the city’s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affair, said HIV prevalence among high-risk groups, including drug users, men who have sex with men, prostitutes, remained high. Last year, the city reported more than 5,800 new HIV infections, Khiết said at a meeting held on Monday (May 28) in HCM City. The rising number of young addicts taking methamphetamine and other types of drugs poses challenges for rehab programmes and management of former addicts, Khiết said. More than 9,500 drug addicts are taking part in detoxification and rehabilitation programmes at rehabilitation facilities in the city and more than 1,300 addicts are undergoing rehab at home. The city is home to 19 State-owned and three private rehab facilities offering compulsory and voluntary rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts. Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến, Minister of Health, said the city had made constant efforts to manage drug addicts who do not have residential permits. However, the cost of detoxification and rehabilitation for injections is high, while relapse is common, Tiến said. The city should learn from rehabilitation models in other countries and use the services of the private sector to operate voluntary rehabilitation models. Methadone maintenance therapy remains a key approach to help addicts quit their use of drugs and it should be expanded to wards and communes, she said. She said that rehab facilities should take into account the 90-90-90 treatment target by UNAIDS. Nguyễn Thị Thu, deputy chairwoman of the city’s People’s Committee, said the high rate of relapse was the most serious challenge faced by rehab programmes.

HIV/AIDs treatment costs to spike,"People with HIV and AIDS are expecting medical costs to soar when international health aid is cut off next year, participants at a policy dialogue said yesterday.",[],2016-06-28,vietnamnews.vn,"People with HIV/AIDS receives consulting at a medical station. People with HIV and AIDS are expecting medical costs to soar when international health aid is cut off next year. — Photo kenh13.info HÀ NỘI — People with HIV and AIDS are expecting medical costs to soar when international health aid is cut off next year, participants at a policy dialogue said yesterday. Further complicating the issue, this demographic has found it difficult to secure health insurance. The dialogue on a health insurance policy for people living with HIV/AIDS was co-organised by The Việt Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations and the Health Ministry’s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. Health insurance is expected to be a life preserver for HIV/AIDS patients in Việt Nam, particularly when international aid, which covers almost all medical fees for HIV-positive patients in the country, will cease next year because Việt Nam has now been categorised as a middle-income country. Deputy head of the AIDS Department Hoàng Đình Cảnh said that when HIV/AIDS patients pay for health insurance, they would be held accountable to the medical treatment scheme. As a result, they would avoid skipping treatment or shifting to other medical treatment schemes, which are usually more expensive, he said. Trịnh Thị Lê Trâm, director of the Hà Nội-based Centre for Law, Healthcare and HIV/AIDS Policies under the Việt Nam Bar Association, said HIV/AIDS patients are usually poor, unemployed or have unstable incomes. “They usually fail to afford health insurance cards, and they need significant medical care to treat opportunistic infections in addition to their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment,” Trâm said. Despite the fact that under the Law on Health Insurance, poor households were granted free health insurance cards and near-poor households had to pay only half of health insurance fees, people with HIV/AIDS still struggled to gain health insurance coverage. Đỗ Đăng Đông, a representative from the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (VNP+), said that besides administrative difficulties in applying for health insurance, societal stigma and discrimination were major barriers that prevented HIV/AIDS carriers from seeking insurance. Those who left their hometowns to live in other localities also find it difficult to obtain insurance because only residents with permanent or temporary registration can apply for health insurance, he said. HIV/AIDS children born overseas to mothers who were trafficked or married foreigners could not apply for health insurance either because they did not have birth certificates, he added. Đông said that many people with HIV/AIDS also suffer from cancers that require expensive medicines. Under a circular issued by the Health Ministry guiding the revised Law on Health Insurance, 25 types of expensive medicines used to treat cancer were paid for by both health insurance agencies and patients, Đông said, adding that it was a big burden for HIV/AIDS patients. An HIV/AIDS carrier in Hà Nội’s Gia Lâm District said he had to take a medicine that cost VNĐ1.35 million (US$60.70) daily to prevent the development of cancer cells. Previously, health insurance paid for the medicine in whole, but since 2015 he has paid half, which created a large financial burden for him and his family, he said. —VNS",Society,"['medical', 'spike', 'patients', 'việt', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'usually', 'costs', 'paid', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","The dialogue on a health insurance policy for people living with HIV/AIDS was co-organised by The Việt Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations and the Health Ministry’s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.

VN contestant raises HIV awareness,Miss Universe Việt Nam H’Hen Nie has called for reducing stigma and discrimination against HIV patients at the Miss Universe 2018 contest that is now being held in Bangkok.,[],2018-12-04,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — Miss Universe Việt Nam H’Hen Nie has called for reducing stigma and discrimination against HIV patients at the Miss Universe 2018 contest that is now being held in Bangkok. H’Hen Nie is participating in the United Nations’ Global Campaign on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as part of the effort to create “a red ribbon wave” at this year’s beauty pageant. By wearing a red ribbon on her arms during the beauty event, which ends on December 17, H’Hen Nie is showing her support to the campaign. “With support from the international community at the Miss Universe contest this year, I do believe in a more civilised attitude for the future of the community of HIV/AIDS patients,” she told Việt Nam News. The campaign, which marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day (December 1), aims to protect patients and stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. Since being crowned Miss Universe Việt Nam last year, H’Hen Nie, who is from the Ê Đê ethnic group of the Central Highlands province of Đắk Lắk, has taken part in many social activities, especially those related to HIV/AIDS. H’Hen Nie has also been involved in the U=U campaign (undetectable=untransmittable) funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The U=U statement has been recognised or endorsed by more than 782 medical and community-based organisations in more than 95 countries. The statement builds on evidence-based research demonstrating that HIV treatment is highly effective in reducing HIV transmission and that people living with HIV on ARV (antiretroviral) treatment with an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexual transmission. Việt Nam has consistently shown strong leadership in responding to HIV in the world and the region. In recent years, Việt Nam has enhanced screening and testing for high-risk people to achieve the UN’s 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020. Under the goals, by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. Ninety per cent of people with a diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained ARV therapy, while 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Việt Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health. Speaking at a recent meeting to respond to World AIDS Day, Nguyễn Thị Kim Tiến, health minister, said more than 8,000 new HIV cases were detected every year in Việt Nam. “The country still has nearly 50,000 people with HIV who do not know their status. These are challenges which we still face,” she said. The rate of HIV infection among users who inject drugs, especially among youth, has seen an upward trend, according to the ministry.

In the near future, international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention will be cut. Three assistance projects operated by Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be withdrawn by the end of 2017. Additionally, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has announced that it will stop offering services by the end of 2018 and only support us with technical issues. At present, we are requesting money from the Global Fund since several international projects will end their service assistance, putting more burden on the AIDS fight in Việt Nam. How does the MoH deal with this situation? Since 2013, the ministry has consulted the government developing financial plans for HIV/AIDS prevention. We recommend the Government effectively mobilise domestic resources including the State budget, local budgets and socialised sources. On the other hand, the Government is encouraged to seek and maintain international aid if possible. Additionally, it is necessary to identify and focus on priority groups. In the context of reduced support, the efficient use of resources is especially important. Besides, the government has directed local authorities to make their own financial plans for HIV/AIDS prevention. Until now, more than 50 provinces have had their plans approved while only 8 others are building or proposing plans. Some provinces have allocated sufficient resources to maintain treatment practices, but it is not always sufficient. However, we recognise their efforts in the AIDS fight. The Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) has conducted several field trips in some provinces of the Cửu Long River Delta, one of the country’s areas most affected by AIDS. What do you think about their work on HIV/AIDS prevention? We just came back from two field trips in Cần Thơ City and Bến Tre Province. They are sharing some common issues in the AIDS fight. Unlike in the North, in Cửu Long River Delta’s provinces, HIV/AIDS is commonly transmitted through sexual contact. For example, in Cần Thơ City and Bến Tre Province, 80 per cent of people are infected due to unsafe sex. Therefore, the two provinces need to promote practicing safe sex, including the use of condoms. Besides organic drugs such as heroin or morphine, synthetic drugs are increasingly being abused, especially among the youth. While methadone can be used to treat opioid dependence, there is no treatment offered to synthetic drug abusers. Moreover, synthetic drug abusers experience illusions, leading to the loss of control and unsafe sex. According to a report by VAAC, gay and bisexual groups (MSM) in the two provinces are witnessing an increase in HIV-infected people. We have not yet controlled HIV transmission through sex acts in this group. How is HIV/AIDS prevention in the two provinces? We think that both localities have made huge efforts in preventing HIV. However, Cần Thơ City has been enjoying more favourable conditions since it is the key area of the drug fight in Southern provinces. The city has received support from international organisations to enhance human resources and infrastructure for fighting against HIV/AIDS. Bến Tre Province does not have these opportunities; however, it has efficiently implemented prevention solutions, including public communications, preventive treatment for mother-to-child transmission and voluntary counselling and testing. – VNS",Society,"['running', 'international', 'city', 'resources', 'việt', 'hivaids', 'sources', 'prevention', 'aids', 'tre', 'funding', 'treatment', 'provinces']","Now, the country’s efforts to fight the disease are running into financial obstacles as aid from international organisations—the key funding source for HIV/AIDS prevention—runs out.

The event was organised by the Hà Nội Medical University in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Partnership for Health Advancement in Việt Nam (HAIVN). The toolkit is based on the idea K=K – (Không phát hiện = Không lây truyền) or U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable in English) – with the core message: “I’m positive, he/she will never be.” The toolkit includes a K=K logo, posters, videos, infographics and handbook for sharing in print and through social media. The U=U statement has been recognised or endorsed by more than 782 medical and community-based organisations in more than 95 countries. The statement builds on evidence-based research demonstrating that HIV treatment is highly effective in reducing forward HIV transmission and that people living with HIV on ARV (antiretroviral) treatment with an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexual transmission. “This is a truly transformational message which will change the lives of people living with HIV around the world. The K=K toolkit is expected to be shared widely among the community and be effective in combatting HIV-related stigma and discrimination,” said Dr Todd Pollack, Country Director of HAIVN. “We’ve long known that with effective treatment, people living with HIV can live full, healthy productive lives. We now know—conclusively—that daily adherence to this therapy means that HIV cannot be transmitted to sexual partners. This is joyful, life-altering information for persons with HIV, their sexual partners, and their families,” said Dr John Blandford, Country Director of CDC in Việt Nam.

Lê Văn Phúc, head of the pharmacy and medical supply department at Việt Nam Social Security talks to Thời Báo Kinh Tế Việt Nam (Việt Nam Economic Times). What has been prepared to ensure health insurance coverage for HIV treatment expenses? The health insurance fund along with other State budget sources have been contributing to ensuring HIV drug supplies. The health insurance fund has so far covered HIV opportunistic infections and other testing for HIV patients who hold health insurance cards. It is estimated that by the end of this year, about 48,000 HIV patients who hold health insurance cards will have their ARV drug covered by the fund. The rest of the patients will be covered by 2020. Việt Nam Social Security (VSS) has worked with the health ministry to sign healthcare contracts with HIV treatment facilities and set up a database to manage patients who are on ARV. The VSS and the health ministry also provide ARV drugs to HIV treatment facilities. The health insurance fund covers a first-class ARV treatment regimen. It is estimated that more than VNĐ600 billion (US$25.5 million) is needed to provide treatment for more than 100,000 HIV/AIDS patients. What solutions should be taken to ensure health insurance coverage for them? It is estimated to cost VNĐ6 million ($255) per year to provide healthcare check-ups and treatment for each HIV patient. We need solutions to ensure the fund is capable of covering health insurance card holders including HIV patients. We need to step up management on using the insurance fund in an effective way. Quality and prices of drugs, management and use must be ensured. We should make plans to adjust health insurance premiums and taxes on alcohol and cigarettes to contribute to the health insurance fund. How are you planning to convince more HIV patients to sign up for the health insurance programme in order to ensure better treatment for them? Việt Nam is now the only country mobilising domestic sources for HIV/AIDS treatment. The VSS and the health ministry have created the most favourable conditions for HIV patients to access health insurance. The number of HIV patients who hold health insurance card holders has increased. The coverage rate for HIV patients in many localities has reached 100 per cent. However, the health insurance coverage rate in some localities remains low because patients are afraid of being discriminated against and do not want to reveal their personal information. The VSS and the health ministry will step up communication campaigns on HIV and ARV patients to share the importance of health insurance. We expect authorities will continue to improve HIV treatment service quality and create a friendly environment for HIV carriers by changing medical staff’s attitudes towards patients as well as their consultation and communication skills.

"VN aims to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis","Children and pregnant women lack access to health services in remote, border and island areas, creating a major challenge for the national programme to eliminate the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis from mothers to children, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Viết Tiến said in Hà Nội on May 22.",[],2018-05-23,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — Children and pregnant women lack access to health services in remote, border and island areas, creating a major challenge for the national programme to eliminate the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis from mothers to children, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyễn Viết Tiến said in Hà Nội on May 22. He told a consultation workshop on developing a National Action Plan to eliminate the mother-to-child transmission of such diseases in the 2018-30 period, co-organised by Ministry of Health’s Maternal and Child Health Department in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO). Tiến said that the goal of complete elimination of mother-to-child transmission of these diseases is clear, and the whole health sector is working to make it happen. ""The transmission of these diseases from mother to child causes many consequences, greatly affecting the health of mothers and children,"" Tiến said. The department reported that the rate of HIV infection among the country’s two million pregnant women every year is 0.25 per cent. At the same time, Việt Nam is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of hepatitis B virus in the world, at 10-20 per cent, according to the health ministry. Therefore, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus among pregnant women is also high. According to the Central Dermatology Hospital ’s latest report, the incidence of congenital syphilis in newborns is on the rise. A draft on the National Action Plan to eliminate the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis from mother to child in the 2018-30 period has been completed by the Ministry of Health. The plan will focus on key solutions: strengthening communication and finance, innovating new methods of treatment and enhancing the quality of health services such as screening, diagnosis, care and treatment for mothers and children. At the workshop, participants discussed issues such as antenatal care and pre-testing for disease discovery, interventions for pregnant women, mother-to-child transmission, funding for the implementation of the plan, inter-sector coordination and monitoring. According to WHO, in the western Pacific Region, every year, about 180,000 people are infected with hepatitis B, 13,000 children are infected with syphilis and 1,400 children are infected with HIV. These diseases can be prevented through simple and accessible interventions, including pre-testing for pregnant women and vaccination of infants after birth. Participants at the workshop agreed that in Việt Nam , there is a lack of coordination between medical service providers such as clinics, hospitals and grass-roots health centres. This restricts mothers and infants from accessing advanced medical services and limits the effectiveness of medical intervention. WHO has developed a framework for the elimination of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis from mother to child in the Asia-Pacific region for the 2018-30 period and recommended member states develop national action plans to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of the three diseases by 2030. — VNS",Society,"['syphilis', 'plan', 'diseases', 'women', 'vn', 'mothertochild', 'hiv', 'children', 'hepatitis', 'transmission', 'aims', 'health', 'pregnant', 'eliminate', 'b']","The department reported that the rate of HIV infection among the country’s two million pregnant women every year is 0.25 per cent.

Dr Trương Hữu Khanh, the department’s head, told Việt Nam News that the mothers were not provided counselling about HIV tests during pregnancy. Many of them were examined periodically at private health facilities, he said. “If they know their HIV status, they are prescribed medicines during pregnancy and childbirth, which can prevent more than 98 per cent of mother-to-child transmission of HIV,” he added. The programme for prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been carried out since 2005, Nguyễn Đức Vinh, head of the Ministry of Health’s maternal and child health department, said. Vinh spoke at a conference on a national action plan on eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis by 2030, held in HCM City on Wednesday. The rate of women receiving HIV screening before and during pregnancy is 38.5 per cent, while the rate of pregnant women receiving HIV tests during labour is 57.6 per cent. The country has nearly 2 million pregnant women every year, and of those, more than 3,800 have HIV. Between 1,140 and 1,520 children are born from women infected with HIV. Health staff’s counselling on HIV tests and other issues related to HIV for pregnant women is limited, according to Vinh. In addition, health insurance does not cover the fee for HIV tests, and there are not enough free HIV tests to serve demand. Many pregnant women are afraid of discrimination if they test positive for HIV, Vinh said. The rate of pregnant women infected with hepatitis B accounts for 10 per cent to 20 per cent of all pregnant women. Ninety per cent of children born from these women will be infected with hepatitis B. The Ministry of Health has plans to improve health care at grassroots-level health facilities with better communication and broader access to preventive services related to HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. The rate of mother-to-child syphilis transmission is 40 per cent to 70 per cent, while the rate of pregnant women getting syphilis tests accounts for only around 16 per cent. Tests for the three diseases will be included in pregnancy examinations at grassroots-level health facilities. This will help the country eliminate mother-to-child HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis transmission by 2030. — VNS",Society,"['rate', 'tested', 'women', 'hiv', 'mothertochild', 'hepatitis', 'transmission', 'health', 'low', 'cent', 'tests', 'pregnant']","The rate of women receiving HIV screening before and during pregnancy is 38.5 per cent, while the rate of pregnant women receiving HIV tests during labour is 57.6 per cent.

HIV response must cover women,"With women facing increased risks of HIV infection, experts are calling for greater emphasis on addressing the needs of women and girls in the national HIV response.",[],2016-11-02,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — With women facing increased risks of HIV infection, experts are calling for greater emphasis on addressing the needs of women and girls in the national HIV response. Speaking yesterday at a Hà Nội workshop on the importance of mainstreaming gender into HIV work, Shoko Ishikawa, UN Women Country Representative said women and girls living with HIV ""now face extraordinary, and often intersecting, forms of discrimination. Many face losing their home, custody of their children and property and inheritance rights.” Women who engaged in sex work also suffer high levels of discrimination, she said. In 2014 an estimated 240,000 adults were living with HIV in Việt Nam. Although the number of new infections had remained high at 14,000 a year, the proportion of infected women increased from one in four in 2007 to one in three by 2014. More than half of women living with HIV reported their only possible exposure to HIV being through a husband or long-term sex partner who had engaged in high-risk behaviour, according to the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC). VAAC deputy general director Phạm Đức Mạnh said there is ""limited awareness and legal and policy framework which focus on women and girls living with HIV at the moment.” “Only very few existing indicators are women-focused, and the review system focuses on quantitative data and case studies, which provide quite limited insights into the response of women, and more generally, the quality and effectiveness of the programme. Together with the lack of gender knowledge, these are becoming major barriers to an effective national response to HIV,” he said. In Việt Nam, sexual transmission is the most common means of transmission of HIV. Half of all people who were infected with HIV in 2014 were infected sexually compared to one in 10 in 2000. But only 40 per cent of young women have accurate knowledge about preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, according to the VAAC. The VAAC is now revising the HIV National Work Plan 2016-20 and preparing 2017 work plans. 12,000 free tests The HCM City-based Centre for Promotion of Quality of Life (LIFE) is providing 12,000 sets of rapid HIV tests free to high-risk groups, including men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women, drug users and prostitutes via community-based organisations. Counseling on the free service is provided via the centre’s hotline 0943 108 138 and community-based organisations. The service is a part of the international PATH organisation’s Healthy Markets project, a five-year initiative which aims to provide a viable market for HIV-related goods and services capable of meeting the needs of populations facing the greatest risks. The service is funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). At the end of August, the Ministry of Health in co-operation with the US Embassy officially launched the first-ever HIV self-testing services, which use oral fluids, in Việt Nam. Last December, counselling and rapid testing for HIV that takes blood from a person’s finger was provided free to MSM and transgender women in a pilot programme. These activities are efforts of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control and the US government to increase access to HIV tests among high-risk groups in the country. The groups can self test or receive assistance from the staff of community-based organisations who are trained in testing and will maintain patients’ confidentiality. The rapid HIV tests have helped reduce overcrowding at health facilities, according to the centre. The VAAC reports that more than 200,000 people have been diagnosed with HIV infection in the country. Of these, 110,000 have received anti-retroviral therapy. — VNS",Society,"['response', 'women', 'việt', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'cover', 'transmission', 'sex', 'work', 'free', 'tests']","HÀ NỘI — With women facing increased risks of HIV infection, experts are calling for greater emphasis on addressing the needs of women and girls in the national HIV response.

According to Việt Nam’s Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, from 2015, the anti-retroviral drugs were usually provided as drug aid by foreign organisations, including US government-backed President’s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as support from the Clinton Foundation. Since these organisations have run programmes to provide ARV drugs in large amounts to a lot of countries over a long time, in order to ensure the same quality of drugs for all recipient countries, they would bulk purchase from the producers for a slightly better price. From 2015, to make sure that the supply of ARV drugs would not be interrupted, the Government has tasked the health ministry with procuring ARV drugs, using the State budget. Việt Nam’s Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, with the help of international organisations, has managed to negotiate and win bids to buy ARV drugs in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. In 2016, for the first time ever, the department bought 6.4 million 3-in-1 ARV pills – a single one of these 1200mg pills would contain the three types of medications that patients needed – for the price of VNĐ7.299, or US$0.32 (5 per cent VAT already included). Việt Nam has managed to secure a better deal, buying the pills 16.6 per cent cheaper compared with the Global Fund’s purchase price of $0.3681, or 17.8 cheaper against the purchase price of PEPFAR’s $0.3728. Moving on to 2017, Việt Nam managed to buy 3 million 3-in-1 ARV pills at an even lower price, $0.268, 15 per cent cheaper compared to 2016 and still lower than the purchase prices from the two abovementioned aid agencies. The HIV/AIDS Control department said that towards the goal of covering 90 per cent of HIV/AIDS patients with affordable treatment regimes, the financial sum would be a burden on the State budget, and any cut would be appreciated. Dr Kato Masaya, Coordinator for Communicable Disease Group at the WHO Việt Nam Country Office, said WHO considers Việt Nam a highlight in the region in treating HIV/AIDS with ARV, especially its vigorous efforts in implementing WHO’s recommendations on diagnostics and maximising coverage of ARV treatment. Currently, there are 130,000 Vietnamese patients under treatment with ARV drugs.

Khmer soldier adopts comrade’s HIV-infected kid,"Despite fully knowing that HIV/AIDS, dangerous as it may be, can not be easily transmitted just by touching or direct talking, but in most people’s minds, it’s better just to stay as far away from the ‘doomed’ patients. Worse, those open-minded unaffiliated ones who don’t shy away from such common ‘interactions’ with HIV/AIDS patients could, in turn, face some wariness from the less open-minded crowds.",[],2017-12-28,vietnamnews.vn,"Lục Tùng KIÊN GIANG — Most people know now that HIV/AIDS cannot be transmitted easily. They know that it cannot spread by merely touching or talking to an infected person. However, the ostracism of people with HIV/AIDS has persisted in Vietnamese society, despite many awareness campaigns, as people adopt a better safe than sorry attitude. Not only do such people decide it’s better to stay as far away from the “doomed” people, they are even wary of those who interact normally with HIV/AIDS infected people. The fear and ostracism is even more difficult to overcome in rural areas where misunderstandings and fear continue to surround the condition. Danh Trường Danh, a Khmer solider, is an exception. The resident of the Mekong Delta Province of Kiên Giang has braved all the ostracism and fears, adopting two children, one with HIV, of a comrade who succumbed to the dreaded disease. Not only has Danh adopted the children, he has lavished as much care on them as his own offspring, if not more. The Khmer border guard looks older than his 50-something years, the tough life having taken its toll, but a smile never deserts his face. He happily introduces the joys of his life, the two adopted orphans, the boy, Quốc Bảo, and the younger girl, K.C. – to anyone visiting his humble home. “K.C. is in 9th grade, and Quốc Bảo has grown into quite a beefy man. He now works with the military command of Gành Dầu Commune.” It is hard for anyone to believe that the healthy-looking secondary school student was at death’s door 14 years ago, with everyone assuming she had no chance to survive. “The whole thing started in 2004. I adopted the children after my comrade died of AIDS. At my commanding officer’s suggestion, I got blood tests done at the provincial hospital. It was very painful to learn that K.C. was in the final stage of AIDS.” At the final stage of the ‘disease of the century’ where the body’s immune system is heavily compromised - boils, scabs, swellings and wounds oozing blood and yellow puss start to pop up more frequently and do not heal. Danh was not put off. He still bathed her, washed her clothes, taught her, took her to school, and hugged her tightly to calm her down during nights when her body was racked by searing pain. Reminiscing about those difficult days, Danh said be believes his love and unwavering care for his child carried her through. It was not just taking care of her daily needs, medicines or treatment, it was giving her the will to live, though love. Overcoming discrimination “One must really understand the social context and Danh’s own family situation back then to fully appreciate the silent sacrifices Danh has made,” said Major Dương Thanh Hoàng, deputy political commissar of the border post and Danh’s colleague. In the rural community they are based in, understanding of HIV/AIDS was really limited. In addition, just four days before K.C.’s biological father breathed his last, Danh’s own first-born son, Danh Trường Quốc, 12 years old then, drowned in a stream on his way home. Danh’s wife, Lê Thị Ngọc Bích, was also expecting, and the child was just a few months away. In the midst of such a tragedy, no one would have Danh to keep a promise he made to his dying comrade, and have the children, who’d also lost their mother to AIDS, cared for by an orphanage. Danh, however, welcomed the two children into his family despite his personal grief. “Of course, bringing up two additional children began a period of serious struggle for me,” Danh said. Since depending on support from relatives on both his and his wife’s side was not a long-term solution, since nobody was very well off, the couple decided to open a small groceries store. After K.C. tested positive for HIV/AIDS, Danh had to seek support from colleagues to cover medical treatment for the little girl. But misfortune never comes singly. When word got around that the adopted daughter was an HIV/AIDS patient, people in the area practically shunned the couple’s store. Witnessing Danh’s struggle, many advised him to send K.C. to an HIV/AIDS centre, where she would be cared for by professional medical workers and the “burden on his family would be lifted.” Danh confessed that at first, he thought it was actually a sound idea, and did some preparations. But, in the end, he changed his mind. “Seeing her own relatives, my relatives, the community at large, all shunning her, I felt like I was the last emotional support for her. If I failed her, no medicine could possibly help her,” Danh said. So he continued to tirelessly do his official work and take care of the girl. Countless times Danh had to cross the forest in the middle of night to get from Gành Dầu post to the provincial hospital when K.C. caught raging fevers. Promise to a dying comrade “It’s comradeship that pulled me through,” Danh said. Born to a working Khmer family in Gò Quao District of Kiên Gaing Province, Danh easily made friends with other officers, the majority of whom shared his poor background. When one of them, D.T.G., was on his deathbed, he pleaded with Danh to take care of Quốc Bảo and K.C., and the friend followed through the promise, even managing to convince his wife and biological children to help him care for the two adopted ones. When his biological daughter grew up and K.C.’s health started to stabilise after gaining access to ARV therapy under the national HIV/AIDS care and treatment programme, Danh’s wife Bích could go work for an aquaculture company. When the fishing season ended, she took up all sorts of odds-and-ends jobs, including opening up a makeshift ‘daycare centre’ right at her home to care for local children, to share the financial burden with Danh. Fortunately, since K.C.’s health has gotten better, locals are no longer shunning the family. Danh’s family is still poor and barely making ends meet, but a certain sense of reassuring stability has come. However, the future is still rife with uncertainties. As Việt Nam has entered the middle-income group of countries, international support for HIV/AIDS treatment, which has allowed patients to enjoy free medicines – has started to dwindle. Now, treatment and medicines will be available only through the government-sponsored health insurance starting from 2018, which would require monthly premiums that may be too much for struggling families like Danh’s. The Health Ministry has said that it is revising regulations to make sure that HIV/AIDS patients in the country are given health insurance cards, and thus be eligible for heavily subsidised medicines. Today, Major Danh Trường Danh, deputy head of Gành Dầu border post, is clear about on thing, no matter what the situation is with government support. “My wife and I will still carry on, until we are no longer able to do so. “I have never thought of what I have been doing as an achievement, although I have been praised a lot by people. I believe that raising orphaned children of comrades is what any solider would do if they were in my shoes.” — VNS",Society,"['comrades', 'adopted', 'care', 'hivaids', 'kc', 'danhs', 'health', 'adopts', 'khmer', 'danh', 'kid', 'hivinfected', 'treatment', 'children', 'soldier', 'family']","Danh Trường Danh, a Khmer solider, is an exception.

The forum was held in Hà Nội to discuss the potential of Việt Nam’s growing social media ecosystem to boost HIV control. The workshop brought the government, the private sector, and communities together to discuss how to further integrate HIV services and support into the digital age. Dr Phan Thị Thu Hương, vice director of Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said that over 50 per cent of Vietnamese people have access to the internet, and a majority of them use social media. “We need to find creative ways to reach them through new and exciting social media channels,” she said. Lê Minh Thành, director of social enterprise G-link, said that our online community on social media provides a safe space for people at risk of HIV to learn and talk about safe sex and services such as HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). “We can reach more people online and especially those who are afraid to discuss these topics publicly. We can then translate these online conversations into offline action,” Thành said. “For example, we share online booking tools to link people at risk of HIV directly to services, guide them to our e-stores to purchase essentials such as condoms and lubricants, and help them to manage adherence to long-term prevention methods such as PrEP with the iPrEP app on their mobile phones,” he added. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and PATH, an international non-profit health organization, initiated a Healthy Markets project that aims to grow a viable market for HIV-related goods and services capable of meeting the needs of people facing the greatest risks. The project is working with local civil society organizations such as G-link, Lighthouse and Vsmile to test and scale online tools such as the Rainbow Village and Be Me.Be Sexy! Facebook communities and the I Reserve app. I Reserve app, for example, has helped nearly 500 people make appointments for HIV testing and counselling since last year. Among those who use the app, 12.5 per cent were diagnosed with HIV—an HIV-positive rate that is twice as high as that seen through face-to-face referrals. This demonstrates that online tools offer effective ways to engage those most at risk of HIV. Dr John Eyres, USAID Health Office Director, believed that with the introduction of forward-thinking methods such as community-based HIV testing and PrEP, Việt Nam is known as an early adopter of innovative ways to prevent and manage HIV. Cutting edge online initiatives that are driven by communities, civil society groups, entrepreneurs, and businesses are boosting the uptake of HIV testing, PrEP, and essential products such as condoms, and are playing a critical role in Việt Nam’s efforts to achieve the 90-90-90 goals, he said. – VNS",Society,"['testing', 'social', 'media', 'services', 'việt', 'vn', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'takes', 'online', 'control', 'risk', 'ways', 'tools']","The forum was held in Hà Nội to discuss the potential of Việt Nam’s growing social media ecosystem to boost HIV control.

Co-organised by Vietnam Authority for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), Ministry of Health and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the events mark an important milestone in securing domestic sustainable financing for the HIV response in Việt Nam and ensuring that people living with HIV access treatment services. Over 400 representatives from government agencies, international organisations, community-based organisations working with HIV patients, people living with HIV, and media agencies attended the four events. HIV patients need lifelong treatment that can be costly and early and continuous treatment enables them to lead healthy lives and effectively eliminates the risk of sexual transmission to their partners, says a press release issued by the US embassy on Friday. Historically, ARVs were provided free-of-charge in Việt Nam through international donors. However, over the last five years, the PEPFAR programme, through its activities, has been working with the Government of Việt Nam to transition the responsibility for financing the country’s HIV response from donors to SHI. Key in the transition was revising the Social Health Insurance Law and benefit package to include funding for HIV treatment; integrating HIV clinics in the public health system; increasing the number of HIV patients enrolled in SHI from 40 per cent in 2014 to 89 per cent in 2018; procuring ARVs through SHI; and creating procedures for HIV services reimbursement by SHI. Across the world, very few developing countries are applying their SHI programmes to cover HIV treatment services. Among the PEPFAR focused countries, Việt Nam is the only country mobilising domestic resources through SHI to cover HIV treatment services. This can be attributed to the Government of Việt Nam’s strong commitment to the long-term sustainability of its HIV/AIDS response. Việt Nam is also a global leader in achieving viral suppression, at 93 per cent. Viral suppression is a measurement of the degree to which the HIV virus is in a person’s bloodstream. When an HIV positive patient achieves viral suppression and has an undetectable viral load, not only do they have a significantly increased likelihood of improved health outcomes, but it also eliminates their likelihood of transmitting HIV. — VNS",Society,"['social', 'covered', 'shi', 'suppression', 'patients', 'receiving', 'services', 'việt', 'events', 'hiv', 'mark', 'nam', 'antiretrovirals', 'viral', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","HÀ NỘI — Simultaneous events were held in Hà Nội, Nghệ An, HCM City, and Hải Phòng on Friday to celebrate the first patients receiving antiretroviral (ARV) drugs covered by social health insurance (SHI).

Lack of knowledge results in unfortunate HIV/AIDS cases,A lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest causes of cases in the northern mountainous province of Son La.,[],2015-12-30,vietnamnews.vn,"A mother gets consultation service on HIV/AIDS prevention in the northern mountainous Son La Province. A lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest causes of cases in the province. — Photo tiengchuong.vn SON LA (VNS) — A lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest causes of cases in the northern mountainous province of Son La. A 33-year-old local woman, who asked to keep her name anonymous, did not know what HIV/AIDS was and what happened to her husband when he died of the fatal disease eight years ago. She also did not think she needed to have her health checked until she suffered from continuous sickness and blurry vision. Not until she went to a clinic and got advice from doctors did she know about transmission risks and basic knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A situation like this is not uncommon in Son La. Many residents have been ""victims"" of HIV/AIDS in unexpected cases. Tong Van Su, deputy head of Infection Department of General Hospital of Muong La District said that among the ten HIV infected children under treatment at the hospital, there is a child who tested positive for HIV after sucking breast milk of the aunt when the mother was away. Even the childs aunt did not know she was living with HIV. HIV/AIDS now not only focuses in the provinces urban areas but tends to spread to mountainous areas where travelling by vehicles is difficult and the information level remains low. Meanwhile, drug smuggling and abusing were popular, especially in border areas, said Son Las HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Dam Van Huong. About 10,500 HIV/AIDS carriers have been reported in the province so far, according to the provincial HIV/AIDS control and prevention centre. In the first ten months of this year, the province diagnosed 405 HIV infected cases. Up to 525 cases have developed full-blown AIDS and 110 people have died of AIDS. The majority of HIV infected cases belong to patients aged 20 to 39. Cases with women and children are reportedly on the increase. It is estimated that in 2020, the number of females infected will make up 55 per cent of the total while the figure on children is predicted to reach roughly 11 per cent. Huong said that facing these statistics, the province was striving to eradicate the epidemic. However, HIV/AIDS fighting and prevention in the province had faced many difficulties, he said, adding that many infected cases were diagnosed too late, which is one of the reasons for the rapid spread of the disease. A shortage of employees to monitor patients had also limited efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS, he said. Many infected children living in remote mountain areas have faced great difficulties in accessing health care services, which pose challenges to predicting infected cases as well as treatment and caring of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. The governmental health programme in the province, which encourages the use of methadone therapy to curb drug addicts reliance on certain drugs through 2020 has been slowly implemented and has faced obstacles. About 6,000 drug addicts are expected to be under treatment under this programme, however, until now, only about 10 per cent are under treatment. — VNS",Society,"['cases', 'province', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'results', 'unfortunate', 'infected', 'son', 'prevention', 'la', 'treatment', 'children']","A mother gets consultation service on HIV/AIDS prevention in the northern mountainous Son La Province.

Hoàng Đình Cảnh, the department’s deputy director, said Hưng Yên province’s investigative police of social order arrested 42-year-old Tạ Văn Lý, living in Khoái Châu District, for storing drugs. He confessed to purchasing the drugs from a woman named Huyền. The police then went to search Huyền’s house. Her elder brother, 46-year-old Nguyễn Văn T., who is a HIV carrier, used a knife to cut his wrist and fought with the police. The eight police officers received scratches from the knife, coming into contact with T.’s HIV+ blood. All the police officers received post-exposure treatment through anti-retroviral drugs (ARV) within 20 hours of the exposure. Cảnh said since the police received the treatment early, the possibility of contracting HIV infection was not high. The treatment will last for 28 days. The police will be tested for HIV after three months. Doctors warned them not to donate blood during the three months of undergoing treatment. T. was reported to have taken ARV since 2010. A virus test in late 2017 indicated a low presence of the HIV virus in his blood. ""Studies show that the possibility of virus transmission to other people remains low if the carrier is treated with ARV and has low level of the HIV virus,"" Cảnh said. According to him, anyone who gets exposed to HIV should remain calm, wash the infected spot with clean water, let the blood flow for some time, not squeeze it and then wash the wound again carefully with soap and clean water.

"Stigma hurts HIV diagnosis, treatment","As the HIV response is being integrated into the general healthcare system, improving awareness of healthcare workers is important in addressing discrimination and stigma.",[],2017-12-02,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — As the HIV response is being integrated into the general healthcare system, raising awareness of healthcare workers is important in addressing discrimination and stigma. “Stigma and discrimination related to HIV remain among the biggest barriers to universal access to HIV health services, and this leads to a high number of AIDS-related deaths,” said Marie-Odile Emond, country director of UNAIDS (United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS) Việt Nam. Despite great efforts from the Government and affected communities over the years, discrimination still exists in schools, workplace, family, community and healthcare facilities, she said at a conference held yesterday in HCM City. This has hindered Việt Nam’s progress towards achieving testing and treatment 90-90-90 targets (90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression) and the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, she said. People living with HIV in fear or denial are less likely to get tested, disclose their HIV status to intimate partners, families and caregivers, and often will seek treatment late and at times even too late. People at higher risks of HIV infection, including users of injected drug, sex workers and men who have sex with men, face even double stigma and discrimination in accessing HIV and other health services. Việt Nam has a clear supportive legal framework that addresses HIV stigma and discrimination, including the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and many sub-law instruments. “The challenge often lies in inconsistent enforcement of these across all sectors and at all levels, and as the law cannot cover all situations,” she added. In 2015, UNAIDS launched a fast-track approach, focusing on innovative interventions to reduce discrimination in healthcare settings in large cities, including HCM City. The pilot project was implemented between September 2016 and December 2017 in three health facilities in HCM City: Phạm Ngọc Thạch Hospital in HCM City, District 6 Hospital, and District 4 Preventive Medical Centre. The project includes two major components: assessment of sigma and discrimination in healthcare settings and interventions to reduce HIV related sigma and discrimination. After more than a year of implementation, the results and useful lessons learned from the project will inform the national policy to reduce discrimination in healthcare settings and expand this effort in other high-burden provinces, with support from development partners. Findings from the project show that it was necessary to measure stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings to develop evidence-based interventions that would improve the quality of health care services. A participatory training approach with healthcare workers to share views and agree on action, as well as dialogue between patients and health care providers to better understand stigma and discrimination issues and health facilities’ procedures, are critical factors to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Discrimination comes from limited awareness and knowledge of HIV, HIV transmission, and lack of universal precautions among healthcare workers, said Lê Tiến Dũng, deputy director of Phạm Ngọc Thạch Hospital. The programme’s participatory training with healthcare workers proved useful and led to initial changes, according to Dũng. — VNS",Society,"['project', 'hcm', 'diagnosis', 'hiv', 'settings', 'healthcare', 'discrimination', 'stigma', 'workers', 'reduce', 'treatment', 'health', 'hurts']","HCM CITY — As the HIV response is being integrated into the general healthcare system, raising awareness of healthcare workers is important in addressing discrimination and stigma.

Community-based organisations make significant contributions to HIV/AIDS response,A system of more than 30 local community-based organisations (CBOs) has played an important role in healthcare and HIV prevention for HIV-positive people in Việt Nam over the past 10 years.,[],2018-09-26,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — A system of more than 30 local community-based organisations (CBOs) has played an important role in healthcare and HIV prevention for HIV-positive people in Việt Nam over the past 10 years. Last week, CBOS met to discuss the status of healthcare for HIV patients with representatives from the Centre for Promotion of Quality of Life (LIFE) and local businesses, with support from USAID and the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Fund (PEPFAR) in Việt Nam. The meeting was part of LIFE’s Community HIV Link-Southern project (C-Link) on enhancing capacity for CBOs working on HIV/AIDS. Dr. Bùi Đức Dương, deputy head of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), said collaboration between CBOs and the public health system was a key factor to increase the number of key populations using prevention and treatment services. In the last two years, LIFE’s C-Link project helped 32,000 HIV-positive people enroll in care and treatment programmes. This year, the project was able to detect more than 2,380 new HIV cases, or one-third of the number of HIV-positive patients in HCM City. CBOs offer HIV tests and treatment referral for MSMs (men who have sex with men) and transgender people. Their core outreach teams include university students and other youths who work to reach their young peers. Cao Tấn Thành, a member of Vượt Sóng (Overcome Waves), said he formerly used injected drugs and had received LIFE training since 2011. He actively supports his peers to connect to methadone and HIV services. Huỳnh Tiến Đạt, head of CBO Sắc Màu Cuộc Sống (Colours of Life), said: “While conducting lay tests, I always listen and show empathy to my clients, and am ready to support them with care and good services.” CBOs’ members are professionals who collect and use data for service improvement. Driven by increased high-tech demand, the group invented the “THEBOY App”, according to Lê Thanh Phương, head of The Boy CBO. The app features online scheduling with SMS notifications, one-on-one chat functions, and updated HIV information. Meanwhile, AloBoy CBO provides services for MSMs and male sex workers, using project monitoring and evaluation indicators to better understand clients’ needs and appraise team performance. The Nụ Sười (Smile) CBO, which targets persons who use injected drugs (PWID), female sex workers, has established a strong linkage with health centres for treatment referral methadone programmes. It is known for high success in finding drop-outs from the programme and client follow-ups. Self-funding Dr Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, head of the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre, said there was a lack of proper attention from government agencies toward funding. All CBOs will have to mobilise domestic resources when international funding falls, as is expected. The aim is to diversify services to secure financial resources and capacity for sustainability through many approaches. Phạm Hồng Sơn, head of G3VN organisation, said: “We seek the private sector’s support such as calling for donations and subsidised condoms at wholesale rates.” The group also creates online marketing, and door-to-door goods delivery to generate more jobs and incomes for members. Meanwhile, the head of the Glink community-based organisation, said that Glink had opened three juice and coffee shops, and a men’s health clinic with a pharmacy. LIFE is a non-profit Vietnamese social organisation established in 2007 under the Việt Nam Union of Science and Technology Association. Nguyễn Nguyên Như Trang, director of LIFE, said that LIFE training helps CBOs to become more innovative and builds staff capacity. She said that partnerships between CBOs and the government were the key for faster, cost-effective achievement of a national HIV response. The deputy principal officer of the US consulate general in HCM City, Timothy Liston, praised the CBOs’ contributions in fighting HIV/AIDS in Việt Nam and called for more public-private partnerships (PPP) in HIV prevention services. At the event, four comprehensive cooperation agreements were also signed, including one between Khánh Hòa Province’s Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and LIFE, a Public Outpatient Clinic of District 1 in HCM City and community organisation G3VN, Việt Hưng Garment Joint Stock Company and CBO experts, and another between the EasyCare Network and Galant Clinic in HCM City.

Total market strategy could fill gaps in int'l HIV/AIDS funding,A conference held in Hai Phong City last week discussed the promise of a total market approach to Viet Nam's HIV prevention efforts now that foreign HIV-aid to the country will cease in 2017.,[],2015-09-07,vietnamnews.vn,"Viet Nam hopes to reduce the number of people with HIV to 0.3 per cent by 2020. — File Photo HAI PHONG (VNS) — A conference held in Hai Phong City last week discussed the promise of a total market approach to Viet Nams HIV prevention efforts now that foreign HIV-aid to the country will cease in 2017. The cut in international funds comes now that Viet Nam has middle-income country status. A ‘total market approach means the Government would mobilise public and private stakeholders to enhance sustainable access to health products and services for all people, especially, people with HIV. The approach enables government and private donors to prioritise finite resources for populations that need free or subsidised commodities and services, and allows the commercial market to provide options for those that are able and prefer to pay. The approach is seen as key to Viet Nams adaptation to rapidly changing HIV prevention and treatment structures, said Ngo Minh Trang from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Christopher Brady, a market dynamics specialist from PATH – an international non-profit organisation, said that the approach is especially important when government resources are limited and foreign aid declines. He suggested that the Government assess the perspectives of different stakeholders to better attract interest. Secondly, it should evaluate the business environment and market segmentation. Thirdly, establish a technical support group under the Ministry of Health. According to Ministry of Health statistics, over 227,000 people live with HIV in Viet Nam. According to Trang from USAID, nearly 80 per cent of current funding for HIV prevention efforts in the country comes from international donors. These donors have provided free anti-retroviral (ARV) treatments and free condoms to female sex-workers, but that funding would be dropped at the same time the foreign aid is cut. ""It is a challenge but also a chance for the private domestic sector to produce cheap condoms to meet the market demand,"" Trang said. Engaging the private sector would have to play a big role to ensure the sustainability of HIV prevention efforts in Viet Nam, she said. At the conference, a survey conducted across six provinces by Taylor Nelson Sofres Viet Nam – a market research provider - was released which shifted discussion to the topic of condoms, an important preventative measure. The report estimated that a female sex-worker would be willing to pay VND2,000-4,000 (9 -18 US cents) to buy a condom and someone of the MSM group (men who have sex with men) could afford VND3,500-8,000 (15-35 US cents). A person who injects drugs would be willing to pay VND2,000-4,500 per condom. Pham Duc Manh, deputy director of the Ministry of Healths Administration of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said that the conference allowed international and domestic experts, policy-makers and private sector representatives to discuss how to effectively apply the total market approach. Combating stigma More than 18,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV in Ha Noi, and 5,000 people have died from AIDS, making it one of the highest HIV/AIDS localities in the country. The information update came at another conference on combating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV, co-organised by the Ministry of Health, the Ha Noi Health Department and USAID, last Thursday. The city reported 434 new HIV cases and 75 AIDS-related deaths in the first half of the year. Most of the HIV-infected people are between the ages of 20 to 39 and HIV transmission through heterosexual sex is increasing. The rate of HIV transmission through homosexual sex has also begun to rise in the last one to two years. Stigma and discrimination against those suffering from HIV/AIDS hampers the progress of activities to tackle the disease. The Viet Nam National Network of People Living with HIV in 2014 conducted a study of 1,600 respondents to assess stigma and discrimination faced by HIV-infected people. The results revealed unacceptably high rates of many forms of stigma and discrimination. Gossip remained the most commonly reported form of stigma and discrimination, experienced by nearly one-quarter of respondents. Insults and social exclusion were experienced by 5.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively. A total of 6.7 per cent of respondents were refused employment, and 4.2 per cent of them lost their job or source of income. HIV-infected woman were the most likely to report physical assault with the figure hovering at 2.8 per cent. Female sex workers, HIV-infected women and people who inject drugs are the groups whose rights are most often violated. ""HIV-related stigma and discrimination are synonymous with ‘death,"" said Country Director of UNAIDS - Viet Nam, Kristan Schoultz. Schoultz added that stigma and discrimination not only affected individuals with HIV but also increases HIV transmission in the community as fear keeps people from getting tested, treated or use preventative measures. ""We must act now, without delay to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030,"" said deputy head of the Ministry of Healths Administration of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, Hoang Dinh Canh. — VNS",Society,"['total', 'ministry', 'nam', 'hiv', 'intl', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'gaps', 'discrimination', 'private', 'prevention', 'cent', 'strategy', 'stigma', 'funding', 'market']","Viet Nam hopes to reduce the number of people with HIV to 0.3 per cent by 2020.

Life still difficult for HIV/AIDS affected kids,"More than 14,700 children affected by HIV/AIDS have received full healthcare, education and nutritional assistance after a national action plan began implementation three years ago.",[],2016-11-23,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — Children affected by HIV/AIDS continue to face discrimination and other challenges despite significant gains made in efforts to help them, officials said at a meeting yesterday. More than 14,700 children affected by HIV/AIDS have received full healthcare, education and nutritional assistance after a national action plan began implementation three years ago. The 2014-2020 National Action Plan for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS has thus far covered 70 per cent of the targeted children. The plan defines children affected by HIV/AIDS disease as those who have contracted HIV, those whose parents have died of HIV/AIDS, those living with HIV/AIDS parents, and those with high risk of HIV/AIDS because their parents were drug-users or commercial sex workers. The figures were revealed at the meeting organised in Ha Noi by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) to summarise initial results of the action plan. MoLISA Deputy Minister Đào Hồng Lan said 248 of 345 centres across the country have been equipped with essential skills to take care for children affected by HIV/AIDS. At present, 84 per cent of schools in the country were admitting children affected by HIV/AIDS, Lan said. Việt Nam now has about 21,000 children affected by HIV/AIDS, including 6,800 living with HIV/AIDS. Among the goals set in the action plan are to provide healthcare, education and nutritional assistance to 90 per cent of affected children by 2020; to equip 90 per cent of centres with skills needed to care for children affected by HIV/AIDS; and to have 100 per cent of schools in the country admit children affected by HIV/AIDS. Challenges remain Despite the progress made, challenges remained in assisting children affected by HIV/AIDS, Lan said. Public awareness of taking care of and protecting children affected by HIV/AIDS had not improved as expected, she said, adding that children affected by the virus and disease still faced discrimination. Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy head of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said lack of knowledgeable staff at HIV/AIDS child care centres was one of the challenges. The meeting heard that 27 provinces and cities had failed to spend enough money on caring for children affected by HIV/AIDS. Task force Lan said her ministry would work with the Health Ministry and the Ministry of Education and Training to meet the national action plan’s targets. A task force with officials and experts from the three ministries would work to outline the most effective model for supporting children affected by HIV/AIDS in the remaining four years (2017-20), she said. “:There would be more frequent dissemination of information to raise public awareness and reduce discrimination in our society,” she said. 8,000 new HIV patients Meanwhile, the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control has announced that about 8,000 people have contracted HIV in the first ten months of this year. The number marked a slight decline compared to the same period last year, Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the administration that functions under the Health Ministry, told online newspaper Vietnam Plus on Monday. The administration estimates the number of people living with AIDS at 6,500 and HIV-related deaths to reach 2,000 by the end of this year. The death toll was the same as previous years and is set to rise in certain areas in the coming years, he said. Long said sexual intercourse had been identified as the most common cause for HIV/AIDS transmission in Việt Nam now. Earlier, the sharing of syringes by drug abusers had been identified as the main cause of transmission. The most vulnerable groups were wives and partners of HIV/AIDS patients, he said. “This means that although we had curbed the HIV/AIDS disease’s spread over the past 30 years, the potential for recurrence of an outbreak still exists if we fail to take stricter measures,” he added. Therefore, Việt Nam would continue giving top priority to achieving the 90-90-90 targets by 2020 (with vision towards 2030), Long said. The targets are to ensure at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV know their status; 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy diagnosed with viral suppression. According to the Health Ministry, there are over 215,600 people living with HIV in the country, and 88,868 people living with AIDS. The total number of people who’ve died after contracting HIV is 89,412.

Govt to bring all HIV patients into insurance net,"As HIV funding dries up, Govt wants to bring all patients into insurance net",[],2017-07-05,vietnamnews.vn,"San Hà HCM CITY — N.C.T, a 32-year-old man, and his partner, a 38-year-old man, are waiting at the District 11 Preventive Medicine Centre to receive free antiretroviral drugs. With international support, ARV treatment has been made available free of charge in Việt Nam. But from next year the two men will no longer enjoy free medicines and treatment, and health insurance cards will be the lifebuoy for HIV patients like them. They live together in a rented house in Bình Tân District, but have been coming to the centre for HIV treatment for the past three years for fear of being seen in their neighbourhood waiting in a queue to pick up medication for HIV. But since social stigma and discrimination remain widespread in the country, most insured people living with HIV are unwilling to use their health insurance cards for fear of revealing their infection status. “My company buys a health insurance card for me,” N.C.T said. “The company might discover my HIV infection if I register for treatment using the health insurance card.” According to Bùi Thị Tú Anh, deputy head of the centre’s public health consulting and support department, the concern about disclosure of their HIV infection status is very common among patients. Around 2,000 people are being treated at the department, with 74 per cent having insurance. “Many patients are teachers, students, State officials, managers and senior workers in large companies, and all of them have health insurance. But they refuse to use the insurance for HIV treatment due to the fear of leaking their infection status.” Many patients want to buy additional health insurance to exclusively use for their HIV treatment, but one person is allowed to get only one health insurance card. As international donors are phasing out assistance for HIV/AIDS control in Việt Nam, patients have to pay for health checks, regular tests and ARV treatment next year if they do not have national health insurance. 100 per cent insurance coverage With donors phasing out assistance, social health insurance for people living with HIV will become vital to sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services. Between 2008 and 2013 the city received international support for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment from long-term sponsors such as the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the Clinton Foundation. PEPFAR’s aid accounted for 80-85 per cent of the city’s financial resources to combat HIV/AIDS, Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, director of the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, said. ""International financial support has been decreasing since 2011 and is expected to dry up in the next two years,"" she said. Funding from the central budget falls short of the need, plunging from nearly VNĐ7.9 billion (US$349,550) in 2012 to just VNĐ1.7 billion (US$75,220) in 2014. In 2016-20 there is not a single national programme for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. HIV/AIDS work in the city is estimated to require more than VNĐ2.8 trillion (US$123.89 million)in 2014-20. But only VNĐ2.22 trillion (US$98.23 million) is likely to be mobilised, resulting in a shortage of nearly VNĐ579 billion, according to Vân. HCM City has nearly 30,000 people living with HIV, of whom 70 per cent of them were covered by health insurance, according to statistics from the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. ""The city government targets bringing everyone living with HIV into the health insurance net next year,"" Dương Minh Hải, head of the centre’s care and treatment department, said. To achieve the target, the People’s Committee has approved use of the surplus in the health insurance fund last year to buy health insurance cards for disadvantaged HIV patients who cannot afford to pay for them. However, there are nearly 1,000 HIV patients without identity documents such as identity cards, household registration books and residence cards or in jail. “Insured HIV patients without identity documents are ineligible for health insurance as patients are required to furnish identity documents,” Hải said “This is the greatest challenge yet to be addressed.” Kim Chi Na, head of the District 11 Preventive Medicine Centre’s public health consulting and support department, said for people living with HIV, ARV had been a life-saver. Those who do not stick to the ARV regimen prescribed by their doctors might become resistant to the drugs. Resistance increases the risk that the virus will mutate and produce drug-resistant HIV. Patients without identity documents would not be able to adhere to their treatment regime due to a lack of financial support, increasing risk of HIV drug resistance, she said. To address this problem, the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre plans to work with the city Public Security Agency to set up a team dedicated to study specific cases and help such patients get identity documents. Outpatient clinics Since November 2015 the Ministry of Health has ordered local health departments to make payments for the treatment of insured HIV patients as well as expand insurance coverage for people living with HIV. The city has 46 outpatient clinics that provide ARV treatment, according to the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. Outpatient clinics at the HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Phạm Ngọc Thạch Hospital, and Paediatrics Hospital No.1 and No.2 have provided health checks and treatment for HIV patients with insurance. Bùi Đức Dương, deputy director of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said with the current limited resources it was essential for everyone with HIV to sign up for the health insurance scheme. The administration would mobilise all resources and create favorable conditions for people with HIV to be covered by health insurance and help them comply with the ARV regime at any cost, he said. The Vietnamese Government targets bringing 100 per cent of people with HIV into the health insurance net by 2020. It targets the 90-90-90 goal by 2020, which refers to 90 per cent of all people living with HIV knowing their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people diagnosed with HIV getting sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90 per cent of all people receiving the therapy having viral suppression. As of the end of last January, the country had 116,000 people with HIV getting ARV treatment. —VNS",Society,"['bring', 'arv', 'patients', 'city', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'net', 'cent', 'govt', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","But they refuse to use the insurance for HIV treatment due to the fear of leaking their infection status.”Many patients want to buy additional health insurance to exclusively use for their HIV treatment, but one person is allowed to get only one health insurance card. 100 per cent insurance coverageWith donors phasing out assistance, social health insurance for people living with HIV will become vital to sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services.

Enlisting the community in fight with HIV,His plan to study abroad collapsed just a few hours before an interview at the US embassy in Ha Noi after his father caught him using drugs in a hotel restroom.,[],2015-12-01,vietnamnews.vn,"by Luu Van Dat HCM CITY (VNS) — His plan to study abroad collapsed just a few hours before an interview at the US embassy in Ha Noi after his father caught him using drugs in a hotel restroom. Nguyen Thanh Hoa, 36, a former drug user who has HIV and hepatitis B and C, recently recalled the incident from 19 years ago with pain palpable in his eyes. Hoa – he asked not to be identified by his real name since the stigma against HIV/AIDS remains in Viet Nam — saw his life change totally, and he became a peer educator rather than a doctor with a US degree. ""My father was not at all angry when he found me using drugs that day; he was upset. He asked me to suspend the plan to go abroad and go instead to a rehabilitation centre."" At that time his father had hopes that some day his only son would kick his drug addiction and resume his education. But Hoa destroyed all those hopes: he had to be admitted to public and private rehabilitation centres at least 30 times and was later found infected with HIV. Hoa cannot forget how he got caught up in the world of drugs. In 1993, when he was a 14 year-old schoolboy and meritorious student for several consecutive years, he met some strangers from Hai Phong in his neighbourhood. They offered him and some others in the area some free heroin to smoke with cigarettes saying it would make him energetic and smarter. ""At that time I had no idea about the danger of heroin. I thought it was the same as cigarettes. After that time they gave me heroin a couple of times more."" Once his mother found some heroin in a pocket while washing his clothes, and he lied to her that it was a medicine belonging to his friend. Having no idea about drugs, she believed him. From using heroin, he turned to injecting drugs, sharing needles with friends. Little did he or they worry about the risk of contracting HIV this way. But when some of them tested positive for HIV, Hoa began to worry. One day he decided to get himself tested at the Pasteur Institute. His father said he would come along. ""I prepared myself mentally for the worst."" They went to get the test results. He had HIV. ""I felt sad after getting the result, but did not cry at the Pasteur Institute."" But that night he cried alone sitting in his balcony. Worse was to come. He did not stop using drugs or sharing needles. The only concession he made was to shoot himself last, thinking that way he was protecting his friends from his HIV. He ended up contracting both hepatitis B and C. Life with HIV A friend and reformed drug user came to meet Hoa a few months later and suggested he should play online games instead of using drugs, hoping he would become addicted to something less dangerous. He tried but failed to get hooked on games. His life changed when he once went to the District 4 Preventive Health Centres HIV/AIDS Counselling and Community Support. There he got methadone and ARV treatment and met and received support from other former drug users. Gradually he gave up drugs, though there is the occasional recidivism, according to his doctor. Realising that the lack of knowledge about drugs and HIV/AIDS had destroyed his life, Hoa wanted to become a peer educator to provide information to and help other people in a similar situation. He often visits places where people buy drugs and coffee shops to befriend other drug users and warn them about drugs and HIV. ""Most people think I am a policeman. Some run away on seeing me."" But with his looks and needle scars on both arms, Hoa convinces most people enough for them to speak with him. He then meets them several times first before starting to educate them. He works for community-based organisation Cuoc song moi (New life), which helps 200 to 300 drug users. Explaining the motivation for becoming a peer educator, he said: ""Being a drug addict, I brought my parents much misery. I want everyone to avoid the mistakes I made with the help of information. Thanks to the communitys support, I have a wife and a son who do not have HIV."" Hoa is very happy with what he is doing. Gay community Ben Tre native Huynh Tien Dat, 26, a gay man who moved to HCM City in 2007, has helped several HIV-infected people through his community organisation Sac mau cuoc song (Colours of life) , which he founded with a friend. It works with the gay community and focuses on HIV. Dat said: ""I feel very happy when I can introduce one HIV patient to the [District 4] centre for free medicines. I remember my first client. I met him in an online chat forum. After getting the result, he wanted to kill himself. I counselled him."" This inspired the man to help more and more members of the MSM community though he earns little money from his work. This year his organisations 10 peer educators took 560 gay people to the centre for tests and it turned out that 25 had HIV. Dat personally counsels 100 people a year. Dr Le Thu Thuy of the centres HIV/AIDS Counselling and Community Support, said Hoa does well in his job of a peer educator. In recent years peer educators have helped the centre prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, introducing most of the 1,300 patients currently receiving ARV treatment, she said. ""Every month one peer educator is asked to bring eight clients."" During a visit to the centre in October, US ambassador Ted Osius praised the role and contributions of community-based organisations in preventing HIV/AIDS, hailing the ""tremendous progress"" made by Viet Nam in recent years. ""It is very important to involve civil society in the efforts,"" he said. — VNS",Society,"['peer', 'community', 'fight', 'hiv', 'drug', 'hivaids', 'heroin', 'using', 'hoa', 'life', 'drugs', 'enlisting']","""My father was not at all angry when he found me using drugs that day; he was upset.

Funding shortage hinders Viet Nam HIV/AIDS fight,Medical experts are concerned that an outbreak of the HIV virus is likely to return to Vietnam any time due to a lack of funds.,[],2015-09-30,vietnamnews.vn,"Addicted people is treated by methadone in southern Ba Ria Vung Tau Province. Medical experts are concerned that an outbreak of the HIV virus is likely to return to Vietnam any time due to a lack of funds. — Photo baobariavungtau.com.vn HA NOI (VNS) — Medical experts are concerned that an outbreak of the HIV virus is likely to return to Vietnam any time due to a lack of funds. A funding shortage could open the way to a potential health catastrophe, said Nguyen Hoang Long, director of Ministry of Healths Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, at a workshop held in Ha Noi last week to design an HIV/AIDS Prevention for the 2016-2020 period. It is estimated that Viet Nam will need at least VND7.4 trillion (US$329 million) for the programme for 2016-20 period but it will lack about 11 per cent of the capital. Because the HIV prevention programme will not be a national target programme, it will suffer a big reduction in budget allocation. About 80 per cent of funding for HIV response in Viet Nam comes from external donors but the funding will be gradually lowered because Viet Nam has now been classed as a middle-income country. For example, Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS will cease funding by 2015, the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) by 2018. Statistics from the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control showed that as of June, there were 227,114 people living with HIV in Viet Nam. Of these, 71,115 HIV carriers had progressed to AIDS and 76,588 people had died. The HIV epidemic had spread to 99.8 per cent of districts and over 80.3 per cent of wards and communes across the country. Long said ARV drugs could suppress the HIV virus, stop the progression of HIV and reduce HIV infections in the community. During the 2011 to 15 period, the country saved 150,000 people living with HIV from fatalities and helped 400,000 people avoid HIV infection. Long said about 98,000 people with HIV had received free ARV treatment in the country to date. He said it cost about VND420 billion (US$19 million) a year to treat 98,000 people with HIV. Thus, the cost for medical treatment for one person treated with ARV was about VND4 million (US$181) a year. ""As funds dry up, many HIV carriers may abandon treatment because they cannot afford it, raising the risk of those with HIV progressing to AIDS. ""Finding alternative sources to maintain the provision of HIV related goods and services is crucial,"" he said. Long stressed the need for increased budget allocation for HIV/AIDS prevention in the coming years. According to the HIV/AIDs prevention plan for 2016 to 2020, Viet Nam will focus on keeping the rate of new HIV cases below 0.3 per cent by 2020, while reducing the impact of HIV/AID on socio-economic development. The plan includes national targets of 80 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 49 having adequate knowledge of HIV, 80 per cent of the population not discriminating against people living with HIV, and 90 per cent of people living with HIV understanding their condition and receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. HIV/AIDS prevention in the future will focus on providing sterile syringes for drug users, especially those in mountainous and far-flung areas, expanding the use of new and traditional medicine in detoxification. It also concentrates on studying and applying preventive measures against HIV and expanding the number of HIV testing clinics nationwide. — VNS",Society,"['funding', 'arv', 'fight', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'cent', 'prevention', 'virus', 'hinders', 'shortage']","A funding shortage could open the way to a potential health catastrophe, said Nguyen Hoang Long, director of Ministry of Health's Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, at a workshop held in Ha Noi last week to design an HIV/AIDS Prevention for the 2016-2020 period.

Social worker helps fellow gay men recover from HIV,Anh Quốc Kiệt has dedicated his life to helping fellow gay men seek treatment for HIV/AIDS—and overcome discrimination to gain confidence in their lives after what many still see as a shameful diagnosis.,[],2017-11-01,vietnamnews.vn,"KHÁNH HÒA – Anh Quốc Kiệt has dedicated his life to helping fellow gay men seek treatment for HIV/AIDS and overcome discrimination to gain confidence in their lives after what many still see as a shameful diagnosis. Kiệt lives in Ninh Hòa Township in the southern central province of Khánh Hòa. He is a member of Sóng Biển (Sea Waves) group – a community organisation that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention among prostitutes, drug-addicts, and gay men. Over the last three years, Kiệt has built relationships with 180 gay men in the community, 12 of whom are HIV-positive. He encourages them to practice safe sex, provides information about STDs and encourages them to seek testing, and helps them pursue lives of meaning after a diagnosis, online newspaper Vietnamplus reported in a recent story. His work is increasingly important: According to latest figures released by the Health Ministry this year, the proportion of HIV-positive gay men has increased, while the number of HIV-positive prostitutes and drug addicts has declined in recent years. As of May this year, there were 209,754 HIV-positive people and 90,882 died of AIDS since the disease was first diagnosed in the country. In Khánh Hòa Province, gay people accounted for 18.8 per cent out of a total of 101 HIV-positive individuals, increasing 11.3 per cent against 2015, said Dr. Trần Văn Tin, director of the provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. In response, public health officials have dedicated more resources to the high-risk group of gay men. Sóng Biển is one of three such groups in Khánh Hòa Province. The 18-member organisation was established in 2015 with funds from the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. Kiệt and his colleagues work at the grass-roots level. They are in constant contact with individuals at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. They daily lives are occupied with the struggles and fears of others. “Persuading a person who I did not know before to take an HIV test has been a really hard journey”, Kiệt said. “To go from strangers to friends, sometimes becoming even closer than family because I know their secrets, I had to create absolute trust.” Serving his community He feels he is more effective in his work because he understands the continuing difficulty of being gay in a conservative country. “Homosexual men always feel an inferiority complex”, Kiệt said. “They are hardly able to express their real sexuality, even to family members. So many people have been angry and resentful for a long time, and they respond with a promiscuous sexual life”, he said. This makes them more susceptible to HIV/AIDS. “Because I am a homosexual man too, I feel and sympathise with their pains,” Kiệt said. “So I talk with them easily.” Kiệt said many HIV-positive men told him that they felt despair. Sometimes they contemplated taking revenge on life by deliberately infecting their partners with HIV. “I saw many people wanted to kill themselves when they tested positive for HIV,” Kiệt said. “I had to find any way to relieve their fear and bring them back to life.” For the last three years, Kiệt’s life has been full of journeys which he organised for HIV/AIDS-positive men to find encouragement and consolation. The groups take trips to mountains, beaches and islands to help them release their dispiritedness and desperation. He has successfully persuaded hundreds of gay men to complete HIV tests and seek treatment. To do his job effectively, he must reach out to strangers and become a trusted friend. He makes face-to-face contacts at events and introduces himself on Facebook, the messaging app Zalo, and online forums of the gay community. Kiệt recalled one case in which it took a great deal of time to persuade a young man to take an HIV test and seek treatment. “He was a 21-year-old young man. He was a callboy”, Kiệt recalled. “The boy had not used condoms, so he lived under a cloud of fear that he might be infected with HIV, but was not brave enough to do a test. He always wanted to end his life by jumping down from a high mountain”, he said. The boy lived 28km from Kiệt’s house. For a month, Kiệt visited the boy everyday to persuade him to do a test. His efforts were not in vain. After six month’s of treatment, the boy’s health had improved and he had renewed optimism about life. He is now working in a local restaurant. Everyday, Kiệt makes phone calls or attends coffee dates to comfort and advise men living with HIV. Over last three years, Kiệt has successfully convinced seven HIV-positive gay men to obtain treatment. “I just want to tell gay men, ‘You should do everything you like but you should be healthy’”, Kiệt said. – VNS",Society,"['social', 'men', 'kiệt', 'seek', 'lives', 'hòa', 'hiv', 'helps', 'recover', 'hivpositive', 'gay', 'life', 'khánh', 'fellow', 'worker']","He is a member of Sóng Biển (Sea Waves) group – a community organisation that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention among prostitutes, drug-addicts, and gay men.

VN faces big deficit in HIV/AIDS funding,"Việt Nam will face a huge budget deficit in health services for people with HIV/AIDS in the next five years, an official from the HIV/AIDS Prevention Agency, Dương Thúy Anh, said yesterday at a conference on insurance payments for ARV therapy.",[],2016-11-29,vietnamnews.vn,"ĐÀ NẴNG — Việt Nam will face a huge budget deficit in health services for people with HIV/AIDS in the next five years, an official from the HIV/AIDS Prevention Agency, Dương Thúy Anh, said yesterday at a conference on insurance payments for ARV therapy. Anh said the State budget could only reserve VNĐ100 billion (US$4.4 million) for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in 2016-20, but the demand is for about VNĐ600 billion ($27 million). She said most people with HIV/AIDS cannot afford prolonged use of ARV and other drugs for opportunistic infections. Anh said that was why Government and various agencies have been conducting discussions on implementation of the Prime Minister’s decision on payment for ARV and support for ARV users through health insurance. “Only 40 per cent of people with HIV/AIDS have enrolled in social health insurance, while 72 out of 385 (18.7 per cent) of health service centres provided payment for HIV/AIDS patients through insurance,” Anh said. “The decision will help people with HIV access health service and treatment, through different sources, including a fund for the poor,” she said. In some places, AIDS patients had received support through flexible policies of the local administration. Trần Trường Minh, from Vĩnh Phúc Province’s insurance, said the northern province had allocated funds from donations and other sources to enable HIV/AIDS patients to get treatment free of charge. He said people with HIV/AIDS still hesitate to get treatment at health centres due to fear of discrimination. Lê Thị L. (assumed name), a Đà Nẵng resident with HIV/AIDS, said she has been getting full treatment and ARV at a local health centre for years. “I and other people with HIV/AIDS cannot pay for health services if we do not have insurance. The city also raises different funds to provide a zero fee for us,” she said. “Actually, earning a living is still hard for us, so a helpful hand from the city eases our daily burden,” she said. Deputy Minister of Heath, Nguyễn Thanh Long, said the Prime Minister’s decision will make a big change for people with HIV/AIDS. “Việt Nam has followed the target over past nine years, and committed to complete the ’Zero to HIV/AIDS’ campaign by 2030,” Long said. “The country has been seeking a flexible paying mechanism to ensure that 80 per cent of HIV/AIDS patients enroll in health insurance by the end of 2017 and 100 per cent in 2018,” Long said. He said the Health Insurance Fund will cover full payment of health services and ARV for 90 per cent of people with HIV/AIDS in 2018. He said 90,000 have died and 230,000 live with the disease. Meanwhile, about 10,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS are diagnosed each year. Long also asked provincial health centres to provide drugs for HIV/AIDS patients from the Insurance Fund starting next July. The deputy minister also said the ministry plans to provide health insurance for prisoners with HIV/AIDS and offenders at rehabilitation centres. Last month, the city and the Việt Nam Health Improvement Project (VNHIP) inked a new agreement on health care for kids with HIV/AIDS in the city in 2017-21, with total funding of US$150,000.

US helps VN improve HIV/AIDS response,"More than 280,000 people have received free HIV tests and 15,000 patients were newly enrolled for anti-retroviral treatment over the last five years.",[],2016-12-15,vietnamnews.vn,"More than 280,000 people have received free HIV tests and 15,000 patients were newly enrolled for anti-retroviral treatment over the last five years. — Photo daidoanket.vn HÀ NỘI — More than 280,000 people have received free HIV tests and 15,000 patients were newly enrolled for anti-retroviral treatment over the last five years. A conference held yesterday in Hà Nội to wrap up a national project on sustainable management of HIV/AIDS response also heard that nearly 19,000 people injecting drugs have been given methadone treatment this year. This accounted for 20 per cent of total methadone treatment patients in the country. The US$45 million, five-year (2011-2016) project on Sustainable Management of HIV/AIDS response and Transition to Technical Assistance (SMART TA) was funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief. In its final year alone, the project provided treatment to more than 23,000 people living with HIV, the conference heard. The project was implemented by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 11 provinces. USAID Vietnam Mission Director Michael Greene said that Việt Nam has achieved great results in HIV response in recent years. The response increasingly relies on local resources such as health insurance; and national and provincial funding have become key support sources, he noted. The project has also helped integrate HIV services into the curative health system where facilities can be reimbursed through social health insurance, he said. HIV patients in northern Điện Biên and central Nghệ An provinces were the first to receive social health insurance reimbursement for HIV services. Nguyễn Tố Như, deputy chief of the project, said that one of the achievements of the project was its work in mountainous areas, where many people cannot access health services because of the long distance between their houses and local health clinics. The project provided mobile laboratories to provide HIV tests for people in mountainous areas, and results were provided in 24 hours instead of the usual week. She cited Quế Phong and Quỳ Châu districts in central Nghệ An Province as examples. After establishing mobile and satellite laboratories in these localities, as many as 500 at-risk people in Quế Phong District and more 300 in Quỳ Châu District have been tested. No reduction Phan Thị Thu Hương, deputy director of Vietnam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control, said that after five years of implementing the project, the number of newly-infected people in HCM City has reportedly not reduced. In the 2011-2015 period, HIV infections through sexual transmission accounted for 57.5 per cent and blood transmission was 41.3 per cent. She said it was necessary to strengthen preventive work, and ensure that at least 90 per cent of patients knew their status, 90 per cent of those who knew their status were on treatment and 90 per cent of those on treatment were virally suppressed. These targets would help country could stamp out the HIV epidemic by 2030, she said. AIDS insurance As international donors have begun phasing out assistance, health insurance for people living with HIV/AIDS has become crucial for prevention, testing and providing anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment, health officials say. The AIDS response overall is funded mainly by international donors who provide 70 to 80 per cent of all funds. Some aspects of the response, particularly ARV treatment, are fully funded by donors. Coverage of HIV treatment by the national health insurance scheme is crucial to increasing domestic funding of the AIDS response, as external funding will come to an end next year, they add. Only 40 per cent of people living with HIV have health insurance, according to a report released by the Ministry of Health. Most people living with HIV are poor, many of whom are without a permanent residence or a stable job with health insurance, said Nguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy director of the HCM City’s Department of Health. As ARV treatment has been made available free of charge due to international donor support, people living with HIV have found it unnecessary to purchase health insurance. HIV-related stigma and discrimination remain significant barriers to providing health insurance coverage to infected people. Many people living with HIV are afraid of their condition being made known to the public and refuse to join a health insurance scheme, Hưng said. Nearly 50 per cent of people living with HIV in HCM City are covered by health insurance, but very few use the insurance cards for health exams because of anxiety about discrimination. The number of people living with HIV in the city is estimated at 41,000, with nearly 28,000 people under ARV treatment, he said. It is estimated that ARV treatment costs VNĐ12,000-24,000 for ARV treatment per person per day. The financial burden of treatment costs could hinder access to ARV treatment for poor, uninsured people living with HIV, he added. According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Department, ARV treatment costs around VNĐ420 billion ($18.58 million) per year. The Prime Minister has ordered local authorities to create the most favourable conditions for all people with HIV/AIDS to join the national health insurance scheme. Local health sectors have been asked to sign contracts with health insurance agencies to ensure benefits for insured people with HIV/AIDS. Insured people living with HIV/AIDS will enjoy full payment for ARV treatment from health insurance agencies and the local State budget. The number of people living with HIV is estimated at 230,000 in Việt Nam. A total of 8,059 people were diagnosed with HIV infection nationwide in the first 10 months of the year. – VNS",Society,"['response', 'project', 'arv', 'vn', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', 'health', 'cent', 'helps', 'treatment', 'improve', 'insurance']","The US$45 million, five-year (2011-2016) project on Sustainable Management of HIV/AIDS response and Transition to Technical Assistance (SMART TA) was funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief.

More than 200,000 people have been diagnosed with HIV infection, with 110,000 people receiving antiretroviral therapy, said Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of the Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control. “HIV self-testing is the next step in increasing access to HIV testing, and normalising it as other over-the-counter rapid tests do (e.g., for diabetes or pregnancy),” he said. “It can help Việt Nam achieve 90-90-90 goals by reaching the yet unreached individuals and enrolling those that have HIV into treatment services,” Long said. The 90-90-90 goals say that by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression.

The provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre also helped the commune give normal lives to HIV sufferers. — Photo coutesy of Thua Thien Hue HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre by Phuoc Buu THUA THIEN HUE (VNS)— When men began dying of AIDS in 2004 in central Thua Thien Hue Provinces Loc Bon Commune, it struck terror in the hearts of locals because there were no drugs and few prostitutes in the area. Since then the commune has been called the ""HIV commune"" by some local newspapers. A total of 25 people have been found to be infected with HIV. Eleven of them died. ""The situation was really bad in 2004, because in other communes only two or three HIV-infected cases were reported,"" said Doctor Vo Dai Thuan, head of the communes healthcare service. All of the 11 people who died of AIDS were guest workers who had laboured in neighbouring Laos. Le Van Khuong, deputy chairman of the commune peoples committee, said: ""In 1990s, many locals went to Laos for jobs, including construction workers, carpenters, tailors and babysitters. We supported them in passport procedures but we didnt manage them under any guest worker contracts."" Khuong said from 1997 to 2004, more and more workers went to Laos for jobs because of the higher income they could earn there. Almost all of them spent a whole year in Laos and returned to their home village only for Tet. They had sex with prostitutes in Laos and were not aware of their HIV infection, which they transferred to their wives. This made the commune a key locality in the national list of communes with HIV that needed close control. With a total of 23 HIV and AIDS cases, the commune was at top of the list of HIV and AIDS carriers. Nowadays, local health staff have slowed the increase of HIV cases in the commune. The situation has been under control since 2008. ""There were no newly infected cases in 2009 and 2010,"" Thuan said. ""Two new cases were recorded in the last two years. Both were guest workers in Laos."" Thuan said the education programme had raised awareness of locals. ""Preventive education among vulnerable groups has prevented the spread of HIV."" Thuan emphasised that close monitoring by the Thua Thien Hue HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre had helped HIV mothers give birth to children which tested negative for HIV. The centre has been doing their best to assist wards and communes in the province to give normal lives to HIV bearers. Public awareness had also increased. ""Theres no more discrimination towards the HIV/AIDS bearers. Also they were more confident to use medicine for a normal life,"" Thuan said. Said Tran Thi Ngoc, the centres director: ""We set up a successful network of peer educators, various education programmes and a free medicine supply strategy."" Ngoc said free tests and friendliness from consultants at the centre had persuaded many people to test for HIV and consult over related information. Networks programmes have been developed in every ward and commune around the province, she said. Along with efforts from health staff, committee chairman Khuong said local authorities also had helped create more jobs in the commune, reducing the number moving to Laos for jobs. ""A total of 2,500 people are working in Laos and the number has been stable since 2009,"" he said. He noted that many people found they could earn well in their home village rather than moving to Laos for jobs. This measure had also helped prevent the appearance of new HIV cases in the locality. Now, Thuan is confident that locals are fully aware of HIV facts and he expects no more new case this year. — VNS",Society,"['cases', 'spread', 'publicity', 'laos', 'thien', 'hiv', 'hue', 'hivaids', 'thuan', 'efforts', 'thua', 'halt', 'workers', 'commune']","Peer educators collect needles in Loc Bon Commune, Thua Thien Hue Province.

Community ready to help HIV/AIDS children,The face of an eight-year old girl in a pink dress brightens when she talks about her class and her games with friends. She also likes singing.,[],2008-07-07,vietnamnews.vn,"Community ready to help HIV/AIDS children (08-07-2008) by Thu Hien Children living with HIV/AIDS study at the Social Labour Education Centre 2, in Ba Vi District. — VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc HA TAY — The face of an eight-year old girl in a pink dress brightens when she talks about her class and her games with friends. She also likes singing. Looking at her, no-one would imagine that this optimistic and happy girl, Nguyen Thi Xuan is living with HIV/AIDS. ""Everyday, I go to school with my closest friend, Hat. My classmates are very friendly and help me a lot,"" says Xuan. ""Thanks to the efforts of Ha Tay Province HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, the school and people in Phu Tuc Commune understand us and our disease,"" says Xuan’s father adding that his neighbours show their sympathy and support in daily life. According to Nguyen Anh Quang, the director of Ha Tay Province’s HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, Xuan and her younger sister have received the antiretroviral treatment (ART) at the Ha Noi Pediatrics Hospital. Doctors used antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to inhibit the replication of HIV. ""Our children also get free health insurance,"" notes Xuan’s father. However, Xuan is one of the lucky few children living with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam who goes to school with other children and receives proper treatment; most parents with HIV/AIDS-infected children don’t fully understand the illness and hide their children’s disease. Difficulties Parents hiding the fact that their children are HIV positive make it hard to combat AIDS, according to Do Thi Nhan of the Ministry of Health’s HIV/AIDS Prevention Department. In the recent issuance of free health insurance for HIV/AIDS affected children in June, the department only received 1,300 application forms out of the estimated over 3,000 children infected with HIV that are eligible. And of those that applied, most parents withdrew their applications when asked to fill in their children’s names and addresses. ""In the end, only 500 children with HIV/AIDS received free health insurance,"" says Nhan sorrowfully. ""Viet Nam has enough ARV drugs to treat every child with HIV/AIDS,"" says Chu Quoc An, the deputy head of HIV/AIDS Department. ""The problem is,"" Nhan adds, ""due to their parents’ reservations, pitifully few children get access to ARV drugs."" Furthermore, even when children get ARV drugs, few of them use the drugs properly as their parents or guardians often fail to comply with the rules of ART for children. Children with HIV/AIDS and their guardians need six rounds of training in how to use ARV drugs. This process is very complicated with a lot of stages. The drugs must be kept liquid so they can be injected at fixed points of time. Moreover, the volume of drugs changes flexibly after a few weeks depending on the side-effects of the drugs on children and the changes in the children’s bodies. ""More than 50 per cent of children with HIV/AIDS are born into poor families and are treated by helpers who can’t spend a lot of time with the children,"" says Nhan. In addition, ARV drugs must be stored in a refrigerator or else they lose all effectiveness. ""This seems to be a big barrier because in the poor living conditions, how they can afford to buy a refrigerator?"" asks Quang. Due to the help of health officials in Phu Tuc Commune, Xuan’s father took her and her younger sister to Ha Noi Pediatrics Hospital so that they could get proper ART and guidance from experts in HIV/AIDS, which is why Xuan and her father are now in good health, Quang explains. Treating HIV/AIDS-infected children is important but equally vital is helping them integrate into the community, says An. According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, over 80 per cent of children living with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam have no chance to go to school due to the fact that parents of uninfected children worry that their children will become HIV-positive if they come into close contact. A group of children with HIV/AIDS in Social Labour Education Centre 2 in Ha Tay Province’s Ba Vi District are a typical example: they were kicked out after just two weeks. ""We have enough knowledge to understand that HIV can not be transmitted through normal communication. However, children under 16 are too young to take adequate precautions,"" explains Nguyen Van Phu of Ba Vi District. People in Ba Vi still take care of HIV/AIDS-infected children from the centre, inviting them into their homes on the weekends. ""I can keep an eye on children when they play with each other at my house but who’ll ensure the safety of our children at school?"" asks Phu. According to Quang, the HIV-positive children are equipped with all necessary skills and knowledge about how to ensure the safety of others before they’re allowed to integrate into the community. ""However, easing the worries of parents in the community takes time. The first step is for us, the officials and authorities of the districts, to let our children study with children with HIV/AIDS,"" says Quang noting that, ""If we can prove to them that their children are safe, others will follow us."" ""I know my disease and also know how to ensure the safety for my classmates. I have never harmed them,"" says courageous Xuan. Greater efforts Clinics for children living with HIV/AIDS have been gradually established in the provinces of Viet Nam so that they can receive ART more easily and be taken care of by doctors. ""There are now 28 clinics in 17 provinces nation wide,"" says Nhan with pride. The ARV drugs are also available in various centres like the Social Labour Education Centre 2, Tam Binh Centre. ""To reduce the number of new children with HIV/AIDS, we have made efforts in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV because in Viet Nam, there are an estimated 100,000 HIV-positive women and many of them are of child-bearing age,"" says An.",Society,"['ready', 'arv', 'community', 'parents', 'school', 'living', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'health', 'centre', 'help', 'drugs', 'children']","Community ready to help HIV/AIDS children(08-07-2008)by Thu HienChildren living with HIV/AIDS study at the Social Labour Education Centre 2, in Ba Vi District.

Can Tho helps people living with HIV integrate into the community,Patients with HIV/AIDS are playing a dangerous game of hide and seek with healthcare workers in Can Tho City's AIDS Prevention Centre.,[],2007-01-08,vietnamnews.vn,"Can Tho helps people living with HIV integrate into the community (08-01-2007) Youth from the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta region take part in a camp to fight drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in the province of Can Tho. Over 600 youth attended the camp. — VNA/VNS Photo Trang Duong CAN THO — Patients with HIV/AIDS are playing a dangerous game of hide and seek with healthcare workers in Can Tho City’s AIDS Prevention Centre. ""People living with HIV and their families still bear a great inferiority complex,"" Dr Ta Kim Anh said. ""It hampers our work."" Dr Anh is part of the newly-established healthcare centre in the Mekong (Cuu Long) Delta region that has so far diagnosed 4,600 people in the community with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Eight hundred and fifty have died from AIDS. The struggling centre now is managing 1,300 people living with the virus; however, local authorities and health workers are worried about the number of people who unknowingly have the disease, or disappear after they’ve tested positive. The centre’s director, Ta Kim Oanh, said: ""Only 40 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV return to the centre for advice and treatment."" Every month about 100 people take advantage of the centre’s modern equipment and professional healthcare employees by getting examinations and seeking advice on how to live a fulfilling life with the virus. Others, however, give false identification and a bogus address when getting tested, then never return after they’ve tested positive. With 20 health workers, the centre gives advice to 1,200 cases by telephone or at the office every month. Seven doctors are each in charge of their own day of the week to run the entire centre. Bridging the gap Tran Thi Xuan Hong, head of Xuan Khanh Ward’s health centre, who spent 20 years of her life helping AIDS patients, said she got accustomed to the faces and names of the many drug addicts and prostitutes living in the area. Hong believes the gap between the community and people living with HIV/AIDS is too wide, and causes patients to run away from the disease instead of learning about how to help control the spread. ""My ward reportedly has 71 AIDS patients, but this calculation is far from the real figure,"" she said. She took the case of a xe om (motorbike) driver, Nguyen Van S., who was diagnosed with HIV one year ago. ""I can’t meet him to give advice because he hides from me and other healthcare workers,"" she said. ""There are many cases like S. in my region. We have to spend a lot of time finding them and persuading them to learn about how to keep close control of the spread of HIV to the rest of the community. Usually it doesn’t work because people are too ashamed to learn about it."" Even the family of AIDS patients tend to keep a diagnosis or death secret, Hong said. But there is a substantial number of successes. The centre has got some drug users into rehabilitation programmes, and some work at production workshops while they receive free medicine at the centre. With only six health workers at Xuan Khanh Ward, Hong and her colleagues travel around the city once a week to give advice and distribute medicine to people living with HIV. ""P"", a drug addict who found out he was HIV-positive a year ago after he returned from Rau Ram prison in Long Tuyen District of Can Tho City, expressed suicidal thoughts when he met with the centre’s employees. ""He contracted the virus through sharing needles with the 11 other drug addicts in his gang,"" Hong said. ""He didn’t want to live with the constant spasms of pain anymore and was considering killing himself. But after we had a few therapy sessions with him, he decided there actually was a life awaiting him."" Eight districts of Can Tho City have health centres that give advice to people living with HIV. Additionally, Can Tho City now has 14 groups of volunteers who care for AIDS patients at home.

Many pregnant women in the country are not aware that they are infected with HIV until they are diagnosed during labour or after birth. A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Nha Trang in the south-central province of Khánh Hòa, for example, was diagnosed with HIV in the operating room prior to delivery. The woman had been advised to test for HIV infection during her pregnancy, but she had refused. After birth, the baby was given a preventive drug, and four weeks later, the infant tested positive for HIV. Dr Raphael Landovitz of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles, said it was “very dangerous if pregnant women with HIV do not know their status and go without treatment.” “The chance of infecting the baby is 25-30 per cent if untreated. In the case of treatment, the chances are small,” he said during an interview at a recent HIV research conference in Chicago. Dr Dư Tấn Quy of HCM City’s Paediatrics Hospital’s Neurology and Infectious Diseases Ward said that the hospital had admitted nine children with HIV since the beginning of the year, an increase of two cases compared to the same period. Of these, six cases were from other provinces and the rest from the city, he said, adding that two of the nine children had died due to severe complications caused by HIV. In the first eight months of the year, seven new HIV infections were diagnosed among children, according to the HCM City AIDS/HIV Prevention Centre. Compared to the same period last year, the city has not seen an increase in the number of cases. During the same time period, the city’s hospitals admitted 15 new HIV-infected cases from other provinces and cities, a rise of four cases against the same period last year. Of the 15 cases, eight children died because HIV was detected too late. Dr Trương Hữu Khanh, head of the Paediatrics Hospital’s Neurology and Infectious Diseases Ward, warned that more serious measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV should be taken. “If not, the rate will not continue to fall,” he said. Provinces’ capabilities Dr Trần Thị Đoan Trang, who is in charge of the AIDS/HIV Prevention Centre’s programme on the prevention of mother-to-children transmission of HIV, said that many of the 15 pregnant women had never been tested for HIV. The 15 women were from provinces that lack funds and medical tools for HIV tests for pregnant women. Funds have also fallen because international aid for HIV testing to Việt Nam has been cut or reduced in recent years. Unlike HCM City, many provincial People’s Committees do not allocate funding for free tests, she said, adding that such tests are provided at district-level health facilities in HCM City. As the city cannot financially support the large number of pregnant women from neighbouring areas, the Ministry of Health has approved a plan by the HCM City Department of Health to collect fees for the tests at large obstetrics hospitals like Từ Dũ, Hùng Vương and others. HCM City is now integrating MTCT prevention into its reproductive health care. Trang said that more emphasis would be given to the importance of prenatal examinations, early HIV tests and anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. The rate of MTCT in HCM City is under 3 per cent, she said. Private health facilities Trang of the city’s AIDS/HIV Prevention Centre said that HIV tests for pregnant women were not available at many private health facilities. “The centre has organised many workshops to provide information on the MCTC programme to private health facilities, but only several of them have attended,” she said. To carry out the programme more effectively at private health centres, she said the Department of Health’s division for private health facilities management should work with the People’s Committee and the Centre for Reproductive Healthcare. Catherine Hankins, deputy director of science at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, said: “We do not have a vaccine yet, so the best approach is to strengthen the offering of an HIV test in antenatal care and to strengthen antenatal care first, if needed.” All pregnant women should be offered the HIV test routinely at the first doctor’s visit, she said. The father of the baby should also be offered the test at the same time, she said, adding that this could help identify HIV-negative women who are at risk from an HIV-positive regular partner. A second test should be taken later in pregnancy for those at ongoing risk (either from themselves or from their partners, who may be at risk from use of injected drugs or sex with other people). This can help women who tested negatively during the first test to receive anti-retroviral medication quickly, to protect both her health and the baby’s. “As for taking the medication, it’s not just for pregnancy. It is taken for life,” she said. Hankins said that focus groups should be conducted in Việt Nam to discover what barriers and facilitators exist for women who must take the medicine regularly. At an HIV Research for Prevention conference held in Chicago in mid-October, promising early reports on antibodies that might reduce the need for anti-retroviral medication were presented. But these studies were in animals only, so more research is needed. Improving awareness Trang said that awareness about testing and medicine among pregnant women was still low. Of the seven babies born with HIV in the first eight months of the year in HCM City, four of the mothers had not taken their medicine as required. Temporarily stopping the use of medicine can lead to further resistance, Trang said, adding that the women need more community support and counselling from health centres about these issues. Community and health centres have been told to focus on raising awareness as well as the use of contraceptive methods as several women with HIV have had multiple pregnancies. At the HIV Research for Prevention conference in Chicago, experts also discussed the effectiveness of silicone vaginal rings for HIV prevention and a paediatric vaccine to prevent breast-milk transmission of HIV type 1. Engaging male partners and fathers as parents who want healthy children is also vital to continued success, according to UNAIDS’s 2016 Prevention Gap report. Successfully engaging men in testing and treatment to prevent HIV transmission reduces the number of new infections in women, and the greater engagement of men can improve results at every step. Men need to be involved in family planning, with reproductive health positioned as the domain of both sexes, and more emphasis should be placed on promoting and facilitating couples testing, according to the report. Scientific advancements and experience have shown that immediate and lifelong antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women diagnosed with HIV is more effective than on-again, off-again approaches. In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that all pregnant women be provided with what WHO calls Option B+, an approach that involves an immediate offer of lifelong anti-retroviral therapy, going beyond pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding, regardless of the patient’s CD4 white blood cell count. The global roll-out of Option B+ in 2015 improved suppression of viral loads during both the breastfeeding period and afterwards, making future pregnancies safer. Việt Nam is one of 10 countries in the Asia Pacific region (along with China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Thailand) that accounted for 96 per cent of the region’s new HIV infections in 2015. --VNS",Society,"['hcm', 'city', 'women', 'mothertochild', 'hiv', 'transmission', 'aims', 'cent', 'health', 'prevention', 'test', 'pregnant', 'reduce', 'govt', 'tests', 'rate']","Many pregnant women in the country are not aware that they are infected with HIV until they are diagnosed during labour or after birth.

Schools bar students with HIV,"As the new school year begins, some 40 youngsters with HIV at the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2 in Ba Vi, on the outskirts of Ha Noi, still long for the day when they can join mainstream education.",['Bich Huong'],2011-08-31,vietnamnews.vn,"by Bich Huong ""Living without discrimination"" reads one of the signs carried by students from Yen Bai Secondary School and the Ba Vi Centre for Social Education and Labour at the Colourful Rainbowl camp this month. — Photo courtesy Save the Children Viet Nam HA NOI — As the new school year begins, some 40 youngsters with HIV at the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2 in Ba Vi, on the outskirts of Ha Noi, still long for the day when they can join mainstream education. Quach Thi Mai, principal of Yen Bai B Primary School, said a lack of understanding about the disease had led to a great deal of prejudice and a reluctance among parents to let their children study alongside those with HIV. Mai said five children from the centre were allowed to attend 1st grade at her school four years ago but that they were forced to leave after a few days because of protests by parents of other schoolchildren. Angry parents even persuaded those who were not unduly concerned not to let their children study in the same class as pupils with HIV, Mai said. As a result, a class was opened at the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2, and two teachers from Yen Bai B Primary School were assigned to teach school-age pupils at the centre, Mai said. She added that there are two classes for 34 1st to 5th grade pupils. Over the last four years, the centres children have only been allowed to attend flag raising ceremonies at Yen Bai B Primary School on Mondays and a few other outdoor activities. ""They are just kids. They work and play together without any discrimination when parents do not intervene,"" Mai said. This year, five students graduated from the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2, but none has so far been able to gain admission to a secondary school. Nguyen Thanh Dong, the principal of Yen Bai B Secondary School, said he had been forced to bar children with HIV from the school because of objections by parents, and was reluctant to send his teachers to the centre to teach children with HIV because of the inconvenience. He said parents needed to be won over. He said that could only happen if they were better informed about HIV/AIDS. Pham Dinh Duc, 11, one of the five teens to graduate from the Centre for Social Education and Labour, said his biggest dream was to find a place at a main-stream secondary school. Duc and a number of other pupils at the centre have responded well to treatment with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Although still HIV-positive, Duc said he and most of the other youngsters at the centre were fit enough to study at a ""normal"" school. Ducs friend at the centre, 17-year-old Uyen, has also successfully finished 5th grade. She, like he, longs to study with non-HIV children her own age. ""I spend all my time with them [other HIV-positive children at the centre], eating together, playing together and studying together. We have nothing new to talk about,"" she said. ""If I can go to a regular school, I will be in a class with my own teacher with students my own age. I would not have to share a teacher with younger students in the same class,"" she said. Nguyen Thi Minh, who has been a social worker at the centre for 10 years, said every youngster had expressed a desire at some time or another to go to a mainstream school. ""They ask me over and over again, ‘why cant we go to school?"" She said it was heart-rending when they tearfully promised to obey their teachers, not to get in fights and not to infect other students. ""We have prepared every student here with the knowledge they need when they one day go to a regular school. They know what health precautions to take so as not to risk infecting other people,"" she said. Nguyen Trong An, deputy head of the Child Care and Protection Department under the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said too much had been written and said about HIV/AIDS and that the public had ""overdosed"", leading to fear and prejudice. ""Prejudice plus improper understanding has created a lot of hostility towards those with HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately that has made it difficult for those with the disease to integrate fully into society. Among the victims are innocent HIV/AIDS children,"" he said. According to the Health Ministry, at the end of last year, there were 184,000 HIV-positive people in Viet Nam. Of those, 44,000 had developed AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Of the 4,400 children who were HIV-positive, 2,550 children had received ARV drugs. Prejudice In addition, they were often the victims prejudice and forced ""to live in deprived conditions and suffer the physical and psychological hurt of discrimination."" Unfortunately, An said the law was not being properly enforced and limited resources meant that services for those with HIV were sub-standard. Trinh Thi Le Tram, a medical doctor and director of the Legal Consultancy Centre for Health and HIV/AIDS, said those with HIV were legally entitled to study at a mainstream school. The Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and the Law on Child Care, Protection and Education clearly state that children with HIV/AIDS have the right to attend a regular school. Those that prevent them from doing so are breaking the law and should be punished, he said. Two Government decisions that came into effect last June and this month set fine levels of up to VND10 million (US$485) for those that impede or prevent HIV-positive children from attending a mainstream school. Tram added that the law should pave the way for HIV-positive children to participate fully in mainstream education. Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, director of the HCM City-based Linh Xuan Centre for Child Upbringing and Sponsoring, said better co-ordination between local authorities and schools was needed to ensure the rights of children with HIV/AIDS were protected. She said close co-operation between staff at the centre, the local authority and schools had been crucial to ensuring that those attending the Linh Xuan Centre had gained admission to a mainstream school over the last three years. Tien said that children with HIV attending a special centre stood out and were easily identifiable, whereas those living in the community could keep their condition secret. Tien said three years ago she had been forced to call the police after local residents protested outside the centre about HIV/AIDS students attending local schools. Instead of expelling children with HIV/AIDS, the schools management boards had instead accepted the right of parents to send their ""healthy"" children to other schools, Tien said, adding that all local schools were asked not to enrol those student. In the 2008-09 academic year, 26 children from the Linh Xuan Centre enrolled at a mainstream school, but their illness was known only to school staff to avoid discrimination, Tien added that in the past staff were often forced to lie to parents to protect HIV-positive students.",Society,"['social', 'parents', 'school', 'students', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'bar', 'schools', 'centre', 'hivpositive', 'mainstream', 'children']","""I spend all my time with them [other HIV-positive children at the centre], eating together, playing together and studying together.

The three-year project received funding worth 860,000 euros (US$960,900). Khuất Thị Hải Oanh, executive director of SCDI, said that the project would start with a study to understand the background of young drug users and their social connections, the effects produced by drugs, and behaviour that might put them at risk of HIV. This information would help develop intervention strategies. The project will provide funding to community-based organisations to implement intervention programmes effective for young drug users in their locality, she said. The project is planned to work with networks of key populations and 20 community-based organisations in eight provinces and cities to reach at least 8,000 young drug users with services to help them avoid HIV infection. The eight localities include northern provinces of Hải Phòng, Thái Bình, Quảng Ninh and Ninh Bình; central province of Nghệ An; and southern province of Khánh Hòa as well as Hà Nội and HCM City.

For instance, despite three years of hard lobbying, sisters from the Mai Hoa AIDS Centre have been unable to keep their 15 orphans in local primary schools. The meeting comes a week after people who have children studying at the local An Nhon Dong and Trung Lap Ha Primary Schools protested against admitting the children from the centre and had them expelled. Dr Le Truong Giang, deputy head of committee, persuaded them to allow the centre’s children to learn along with theirs and enable them to integrate into society. He told them that the HIV virus can be kept at bay easier than many others if people know how. Getting children with HIV to study at school is a policy of the Government and it is a right of the children, he said, but has been hard to achieve because of discrimination that persists despite information campaigns. Giang conceded that parents’ fears that their children could be infected is understandable but said helping them overcome the fear is important. The children from Mai Hoa AIDS Centre said they would love to go to school and acquire new friends and knowledge. N.H.D, a nine-year-old inmate of the centre, said he is bored of seeing the other inmates every day. Sister Nguyen Thi Bao of the Roman Catholic Church attached to the centre said it has 16 children to be put in school and two more will reach school-going age next year. She said wearily that it has become a hopeless attempt to send the children to school. ""Every time I go to school to do the paperwork and talk to the school authorities, the children are eager and cheerful but are disappointed and cry when I return with failure,"" she said. Recently the attitude of parents has improved but some remain worried. Bui Cao Tang, a resident of Got Chang hamlet, said: ""We are not selfish to stop the poor children from attending school. But who will be responsible if our children are infected after playing with the HIV positive children?"" Giang explained that the children would not be infected through normal contact and every school in HCM City would be required to have disinfectants in case the students suffer a scratch or other bleeding injuries. The city’s endeavour to fight discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is on the right track but for society to fully accept them could take a long time, he admitted. Bao said she would wait until December before taking the children to another school – An Phu Dong Primary School – but admitted that she has no hope.

Migrant construction workers at high risk of HIV,"Mobile workers are one of the groups at high risk of HIV/AIDS, experts said during a meeting about HIV education programmes for large infrastructure projects last Friday in HCM City.",[],2009-09-02,vietnamnews.vn,"Migrant construction workers at high risk of HIV (03-09-2009) HCM CITY — Mobile workers are one of the groups at high risk of HIV/AIDS, experts said during a meeting about HIV education programmes for large infrastructure projects last Friday in HCM City. Intravenous drug users and sex workers are most at risk of contracting HIV, but migrant workers and managers, who usually work away from home for long periods at major construction projects, are also at high risk of catching the virus, according to the project manager of non-government organisation, PACT, Nguyen Anh Thuan, adding local residents would also be impacted. Viet Nam’s rapid economic development and growth had resulted in increased levels of mobility within the country and large populations of migrant workers, experts said after the meeting. Viet Nam should prioritise HIV prevention programmes for workers and residents near major infrastructure projects because migrant workers on the sites lived far from their families and had sexual needs met by sex workers, Thuan said. ""Contractors should be responsible to enhance awareness about HIV/AIDS among the workers,"" Thuan stressed. Helpful tool kit The World Bank is sponsoring PACT to do a baseline study for US$40,000 to adapt an information toolkit to help prevent HIV in migrant workers at these sites. The study is an initial step to limit HIV infection among workers, sex workers and the community at big infrastructure projects, following World Bank’s recent decision to recommend that such projects worth over $10 million should include a HIV/AIDS prevention toolkit in their budget. Thuan said the toolkit was conducted and piloted at large-scale construction projects in China, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. PACT Viet Nam aims to conduct the baseline survey at some construction projects in Ca Mau Province to adapt the existing toolkit entitled The Road to Good Health and pilot the draft toolkit so that people can study more about HIV and how to protect themselves. ""Most building contractors pay attention to workers’ safety but don’t pay attention to risks they face from HIV,"" Thuan said. Once the six-chapter toolkit has been adapted to Viet Nam’s needs, it will be applied to other construction projects around the country next year. Hoang Anh Dung, a representative from Transport Sector of World Bank Viet Nam, said the province was chosen for studying and piloting the HIV prevention toolkit in Viet Nam because there were many workers from the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta who went there to work. There were six bridge construction packages there and up to 70 workers on each site, Dung said. Agreement reached In 2006, six development agencies including the World Bank, Asia Development Bank, African Development Bank, the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (now Japan International Co-operation Agency JICA) and KfW Development Bank made an agreement to recommend that infrastructure construction contractors conduct HIV/AIDS awareness programme to reduce risks of HIV transmission among contractors’ personnel and the local community.

Further, nearly 50 per cent of the districts nationwide have established HIV/AIDS treatment centres, while more than 500 health clinics in communes provided ARV drugs for patients, ten years after HIV programs were introduced. Additionally, the prevention of mother-to-baby transmission of HIV has been carried out throughout the country. About 70 per cent of pregnant women are tested for HIV and receive early treatments, if needed, with 96.8 per cent of HIV-positive mothers giving birth to healthy babies. Today, Centres for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control have been set up in 62 cities and provinces and as many as 1,300 of the nations hospitals and health centres conduct HIV tests, he said. Also, 47 of the 63 provinces and cities in the country have provided treatment using methadone to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS among drug users this year.

City needs better HIV/AIDS prevention policies for transgender women,"HCM City needs to develop specific healthcare policies and guidelines for transgender women as HIV prevalence among this group is estimated to be about 19 per cent worldwide, according to Dr Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control.",[],2018-05-31,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — HCM City needs to develop specific healthcare policies and guidelines for transgender women as HIV prevalence among this group is estimated to be about 19 per cent worldwide, according to Dr Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control. The risk of contracting HIV is 49 times higher for transgender women than in the general population, he said. Speaking at a workshop on healthcare and HIV prevention for transgender women on May 30 in HCM City, Cảnh said that more research and surveys should be conducted to gather information and evaluate the effectiveness of solutions. He called on the Government, NGOs, the community and transgender people to help reduce the rate of HIV prevalence among transgender women, and achieving the UN’s 90-90-90 Goals in HIV/AIDS prevention and control by 2020. He praised the work of the HCM City University of Medicine and Pharmacy, which produced a research report in collaboration with the Centre for Promotion Quality of Life (LIFE) on risk factors leading to HIV infection among transgender woman in HCM City. Đỗ Văn Dũng, vice rector of the university and head of the research group, said the cross-sectional study was conducted among 456 transgender women in HCM City from February to May this year. The study used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). It found that 77 of 456 transgender women were living with HIV, accounting for 16.5 per cent of the total interviewed. About 67.3 per cent of the people living with HIV were receiving anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. However, most transgender women said they had not used pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs. The survey found that more than 50 per cent of the respondents had previously contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD). More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said they have regular sex with male partners, and 55 per cent said they were not regularly using condoms within 30 days prior to the study. About 25 per cent of people said they received payment for sex with men who were not their regular sex partners, 53 per cent of them not using condoms regularly, the survey found. Factors that contribute to HIV transmission among transgender women consist of non-use of condoms; drinking more than four units of alcohol; use of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) before sex; and incidents related to gender inequality and social discrimination. “Severe social stigma and discrimination may create barriers to accessing HIV testing and treatment services,” one transgender woman told the researchers. The study recommended that untreated HIV-infected people should have better access to treatment and healthcare services related to PrEP and STDs. Developing effective strategies and enhancing interventions are also needed to raise awareness in the transgender community of the proper use of condoms, alcohol, and ATS. “Programmes on preventing discrimination against transgender women living with HIV should promote gender equality in healthcare services,” Dũng said.

The Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control reported that aid under the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, for free anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs and treatment would be cut by 40 per cent this year end and end next year. For the 2016-20 period the Government has allocated only VNĐ100 billion (US$4.4 million) for buying ARV drugs for health facilities, Dr Vũ Đức Long of the administration, said. This means HIV/AIDS patients have to pay for medicines and treatment, he told a workshop held on Thursday to review HIV/AIDS treatment in the city last year paid for by health insurance. But many of the patients have financial difficulties, he said. Dr Dương Minh Hải of the HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre said since last May the centre and other relevant organisations have counselled 27,685 out of 29,402 patients getting treatment. This has helped them understand the benefits of health insurance, he said. As a consequence 70 per cent of the patients have bought health insurance, he added. Of the remaining, 408 cannot afford it, 751 lack identification cards and other documents such as temporary or permanent residential book. Dr Nguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy head of the city Department of Health, said the department has recommended that the People’s Committee should approve the purchase of health insurance for poor HIV/AIDS patents using the abundance of money in the health insurance fund. Nguyễn Anh Phong of the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV said members want to collaborate with the centre to help people with HIV/AIDS lacking relevant documents buy insurance. They hope to help them acquire the documents, he explained. Bùi Đức Dương, deputy head of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said however that patients without insurance are “not left behind” because the managers and staff of health facilities usually mobilise donations to fund their treatment. Thủ Đức District Hospital, for instance, has funded the purchase of health insurance for 40 patients who cannot afford it. Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, head of the city HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, said patients are now treated at four city-level hospitals, many preventive health centres and 16 district general hospitals. Around 3,000 are treated at ward and commune health centres, she said. The Department of Health plans to allow private general clinics to treat patients with ARV drugs, she added.

The information was announced yesterday by Nguyễn Văn Đôn, head of the HIV/AIDs and Addiction Treatment Department under the Kon Tum HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. The 35 people included 24 medical staff, one from Kon Tum Province Police and 10 local residents. Kon Tum HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Nguyễn Thị Diệu Thúy said the 35 people were thought to have come into contact with the blood of a 51-year-old HIV-infected female victim in a severe accident last Friday. She was one of four fatalities in a head-on collision between two coaches. Neither the local residents taking her to the hospital, along with the 12 other injured victims, nor the medical staff trying to save her were aware of her condition. Đôn said that the 35 were given free antiretroviral (ARV) medicine 24 hours post-exposure, earlier than the recommended time frame of 72 hours. Blood tests on the 35 people were negative, but confirmation on whether they were infected with HIV must await final results from the Tây Nguyên Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, he said. The centre’s HIV/AIDs and Addiction Treatment Department head, Nguyễn Văn Đôn, said the chances anyone contracted HIV were low. The HIV-infected victim had been receiving ARV treatment on a regular basis, Đôn said, so the concentration of the virus in her bodily fluids was very low. ARV scandal One of the local residents who took the HIV patient to the hospital on Saturday morning wrote a Facebook post, complaining that he was asked to buy the ARV medicine at VNĐ5 million (US$220). The Facebook account user, Le Tung, said that he used his family’s truck to help take eight victims of the accident to the hospital, one of whom was dead with an open wound. While lifting her to the truck, her blood was smeared onto a scratch on his body. After learning that she was HIV positive, he went to a hospital asking for the ARV medicine. “But a doctor there said that the medicine was not for ordinary folks but public servants only. I who saved people will have to pay VNĐ5 million a (ARV) drink. May I ask who still dares to save people or do we just let the authorities do the saving work?” Tung wrote. Nguyễn Đình Anh, Head of the Communications Department of the Ministry of Health, told Tuổi trẻ (Youth) newspaper that he was enraged. “We are working to identify which doctor did this and asking the Kon Tum health department to handle it strictly,” Anh said. HIV/AIDS Prevention Department head Hoàng Đình Cảnh said that according to regulations, only public servants are eligible for free ARV medicine post-exposure. “However, the doctor should have asked his superiors in such circumstances,” he said. The Facebook user eventually received free ARV medicine and was nominated for a reward by the provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre for his heroic act in rescuing the accident victims. – VNS",Society,"['negative', 'department', 'arv', 'hiv', 'hospital', 'hivaids', 'medicine', 'test', 'tum', 'accident', 'exposed', 'prevention', '35']","Eleven more people were exposed to HIV after responding to a traffic accident in Kom Tum Province, with 35 people altogether exposed to the virus altogether. — Photo zing.vnHÀ NỘI – Eleven more people were exposed to HIV after responding to a traffic accident in Kom Tum Province, with 35 people altogether exposed to the virus altogether.

The film titled Coming Home is about a man named An who meets and falls in love with Lam at a birthday party. They have sex and later it is revealed via lab tests that An has HIV. Lam, who was the person who transmitted the virus, abandons An. Worse, his family also shun him. Nguyen Anh Phong, a representative of Viet Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in southern region (VNP+), said that VNP+ made the film in cooperation with local actors and producers to raise public awareness about discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, especially high-risk groups including those in the LGBT community. Phong said the LGBT community with HIV/AIDS suffers from double discrimination because of their gender and the disease. Their families often ignore them, and as a result, they hide the disease and refuse ARV treatment because they are afraid of being revealed, he said. Last year, a 27-year-old MSM (Men having sex with Men) who had HIV died because he refused treatment at a nearby community support and counselling centre, afraid that his family and friends would see him visiting the centre. Benny Nguyen (his nickname), head of Song That (True Live) Group, which provides counselling on HIV preventive methods and treatment for MSM in the city, said that as MSM, the public, especially family members, abandon or shun them. ""It is more difficult when they are infected with HIV. There is nowhere for them to go. They need sympathy and encouragement from their family,"" he added. Family is needed for moral support so they will follow their treatment regimen, he said. As of September 30 last year, there were more than 224,000 people with HIV in the country, including more than 66,900 AIDS patients. MSM is one of the high-risk groups vulnerable to HIV infection, according to the Ministry of Health. The film is part of VNP+s Dai Bang Do (Red Ribbon) events, which call on the elimination of discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. It also aims to honour people who have made silent contributions to HIV/AIDS prevention in the country.

Speaking at the conference, the centres director, Trinh Thi Le Tram, said few people living with HIV in Viet Nam knew or understood the law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, and this prevented them from exercising their rights. Few had ever received services like legal consultation or legal aid, she said, adding that few lawyers offered these services. Under the current law on legal aid, people living with HIV are not considered official beneficiaries to receive aid. They are instead listed as people with disabilities and have no one to rely on. Shortcomings in offering aid were also revealed at the States legal aid centres based at municipal and provincial Justice Department offices, she said. Those who wanted access to legal aid had to show HIV-positive results, reveal their names and go to a State agencys office, which made them afraid and hesitant, Tram said. She called for support from agencies and lawyers to promote legal aid to those living with HIV. The Government was asked to offer funding to civil societies like Trams centre to better reach out to HIV carriers and offer effective aid, she said. Dr Kristan Schoultz, UNAIDS Viet Nam Country Director, said people living with HIV should be able to access a wide range of legal aid services, including legal education, legal assistance, representation in civil, criminal and administrative cases, and litigation. She said although Viet Nam had legal regulations to protect the rights and legal interests of people living with HIV, stigma, discrimination and associated rights violations were still common in healthcare facilities, workplaces and the wider community. ""Many people living with HIV who suffer discrimination and rights violations do not seek help because they are afraid and feel they have nowhere to turn for protection,"" she said. Hoang Thi Bich Ngoc, a HIV-positive state employee in northern Dien Bien Province shared at the conference that her managers suggested she resign her job after they discovered she was HIV positive. She was advised to ""accept her fate"" and ""quit her job"" when she asked for assistance from local trade union and healthcare officials, she said. ""Tram and her colleagues helped me understand my rights and I still do my job,"" she said, adding that her managers were still unhappy to have her there. According to a survey in 2014 by the Viet Nam National Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, 11 per cent of about 1,600 respondents of people living with HIV in HCM City, Ha Noi, Can Tho, Hai Phong and Dien Bien provinces, said their rights had been violated. They experienced gossip and insults, were excluded from social activities and sometimes lost their jobs.

Dr Le Truong Giang, deputy head of the city Department of Health and deputy head of the HCM City AIDS Preventive Committee, said the city might offer free health care to patients but what was needed more was sympathy and understanding among people. Helping HIV patients join the mainstream and attend school like everyone else was the responsibility of the education sector and public, he said, pointing out most children with HIV studied by themselves in orphanages. Educating the classmates of such children and their parents and teachers was also discussed at the seminar. Giang called for support from the media to fight prejudices and help bring HIV-infected children to schools. Dr Nguyen Thi Bich Hong of the HCM City Pedagogy University said it was a big challenge for the education sector to fight against the discrimination because many teachers and students were afraid of being infected due to contact with victims. But being kept in isolation means the children do not have the opportunity to play with their peers and this damages their psyche and prevents them from leading happy and healthy lives, according to Hong. One primary school in HCM City that admits children with HIV is Xuan Hiep Primary School in Thu Duc District.

Việt Nam begins testing HIV through saliva,"Much like home quick tests, the oral HIV quick test method will be used in Việt Nam for the first time, an official of Ministry of Health (MoH)'s Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) said.",[],2018-06-11,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — Much like home testing kits, the oral HIV quick test method will be launched in Việt Nam for the first time, an official of Ministry of Health’s (MoH) Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) said. According to Võ Hải Sơn, head of HIV/AIDS Surveillance, Monitoring, Evaluation and Testing Division under VAAC, the MoH is conducting 80,000 HIV tests through saliva in Hà Nội and HCM City. The test will also be launched in Thái Nguyên Province, Cần Thơ City and Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province in the coming time. The oral HIV self-test showed 99 per cent accuracy in detecting HIV antibodies in high-risk populations, Sơn told Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper. High-risk groups include people who inject drugs, homosexual men, and people who engage in unprotected sex. A US-based HIV testing manufacturer has agreed to sell the kits to Việt Nam for around US$2 per unit, whereas most kits online go for up to $20 per unit, he said. People at high risk of HIV infection can buy this product and test themselves at home, getting results in as little as 15 minutes. Much like home pregnancy tests, the oral HIV self-test can only serve as a preliminary method of diagnosis. People who get positive results after quick testing should go to medical facilities to seek the most accurate results, Sơn said. “Early HIV detection plays an important role in preventing and treating the disease, especially for pregnant women. Early detection of HIV will help the process of treatment and prevention of infections in children,"" said Sơn. At the press conference late last week, VAAC warned about increasing HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). A recent survey conducted in Hà Nội showed that the HIV infection rate in MSM accounted for 12 per cent of the overall number, Sơn said. The risk of HIV infection could increase as HIV prevalence among MSM is high, he added. According to statistics from VAAC, about 200 HIV-infected children are born each year. “Previously, 500-600 babies were infected with HIV every year from their mothers. It is hoped that this number will drop to 60 babies or less in the future if there are early preventive measures,” said Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy head of VAAC. — VNS",Society,"['begins', 'testing', 'việt', 'nam', 'hiv', 'sơn', 'oral', 'nội', 'results', 'test', 'vaac', 'saliva']","HÀ NỘI — Much like home testing kits, the oral HIV quick test method will be launched in Việt Nam for the first time, an official of Ministry of Health’s (MoH) Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) said.

At a recent workshop in Hai Phong on HIV/AIDS control policies, Dang Thuan Phong, Vice Chairman of the National Assemblys Committee for Social Affairs, noted a decrease in foreign aid for HIV/AIDS control, as Viet Nam enters the group of middle-income countries. He said the government was also planning to abolish the national target programme on preventing and fighting HIV/AIDS, drugs and prostitution, which meant these social problems would no longer be prioritised for investment. Meanwhile, Viet Nam continues to raise its targets in HIV/AIDS control, with antiretroviral treatment planned for 100,000 HIV carriers, from the current 48,000 receiving treatment, and Methadone therapy for 80,000 drug users, up from the 16,000 now receiving the therapy, by the end of next year. Phong said efforts to control HIV/AIDS have so far helped to reduce the infection rate to under 0.3 per cent of the population, and the numbers of new infections and cases of AIDS developing from HIV have likewise decreased. Kristan Shoultz, UNAIDS Viet Nam Country Director, suggested that the country maintain current initiatives and take further drastic action to sustain the results of the past 15-year effort in HIV/AIDS control. She said the UNAIDSs initiative on a strategic investment case for HIV aimed to determine effective tools in allocating and optimising all resources for HIV/AIDS control activities. Participants at the workshop were also introduced to the national investment strategy on HIV/AIDS control for 2015-20. Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the Ministry of Healths HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, Viet Nam needed to focus its efforts on expanding effective interventions, such as supplying clean injection needles, providing condoms and expanding HIV testing among the people. Long also said highly-vulnerable areas and the most vulnerable groups should be given priority in investment, while central and local budgets for HIV/AIDS prevention should be maintained. Promoting health insurance participation nationwide and increasing non-State investment in health services are also solutions to helping control the problem, Long added. — VNS",Society,"['aid', 'national', 'fight', 'reductions', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'cut', 'foreign', 'budget', 'efforts', 'phong', 'control', 'investment']","Concern is growing as foreign aid decreases and the government plans to deprioritise investment for HIV/AIDS control. —VNA/VNS Photo Duong NgocHAI PHONG (VNS) — Decreasing foreign aid and the government plan to deprioritise investment for HIV/AIDS control is seen as growing concerns in the fight against the deadly disease, a government official said.

Free legal aid to HIV vulnerables,"Those most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS will have the opportunity to receive free legal counsel, for example in employment and marriage issues, in a national pilot project kicking off soon.",[],2016-09-21,vietnamnews.vn,"A people living with HIV receives medical consultation in hạ Long City. — VNA/VNS Photo Dương Ngọc HÀ NỘI — Those most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS will have the opportunity to receive free legal counsel, for example in employment and marriage issues, in a national pilot project kicking off soon. The project will be undertaken by the Vietnam Lawyers Association (VLA) and the Global Fund Supported Project on HIV/AIDS across Hà Nội, Quảng Ninh and Thái Bình Provinces in the north together with HCM City and Đồng Nai Province in the south. The project plans to provide free legal aid to those already infected with HIV and those who are particularly vulnerable to being exposed to the disease, including drug users, sex workers, transgender and homosexuals. In Việt Nam, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse has become the most common method of transmission, with the number of new cases due to sexual activity surging from 12 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2013, according to the Ministry of Health. “Vulnerable groups tend to have little legal knowledge so they easily fall prey to abuse without even knowing about it. Even if they do, they don’t know where to seek help because of severe social stigma and discrimination,” the Centre of Legal Consultancy and Medical and HIV/AIDS Policies Director, Trịnh Thị Lê Trâm, said at a conference on the issue last week. A survey by the centre shows that about 75.9 per cent of HIV-positive people never sought public legal consultancy services, offered by the Government under the Law on Legal Aid issued in 2007. Reasons for the low figure of people seeking help at public legal aid centres might lie in their stringent rule requiring the publication of personal identities, or their locations. Public legal aid centres also lacked either separate rooms in which to offer services or legal consultants qualified in working with HIV-infected patients and HIV-vulnerable groups who suffer heavily from social stigma and discrimination, Trâm said. “Moreover, drug users, sex workers and homosexuals are not subject to free legal support from the Government,” she said. The demand for legal aid of those groups was real and has been increasing throughout the years. Trâm said that while there were only 1,900 phone calls to her centre’s hotline (18001521) asking for help with HIV/AIDS and other legal matters, the number increased to more than 3,000 in 2014. “However, the number is still very small compared to the total of HIV-infected people across the country,” she said.

Police on the beat face threat of HIV,"Many policemen are silently suffering from the effects of exposure to HIV. Their struggle against invisible wounds is as tough as the fight against dangerous criminals, since it affects their families as well.",[],2007-08-01,vietnamnews.vn,"Police on the beat face threat of HIV (02-08-2007) HA NOI — Many policemen are silently suffering from the effects of exposure to HIV. Their struggle against invisible wounds is as tough as the fight against dangerous criminals, since it affects their families as well. Five policemen at the anti-drug police picket in Ha Noi’s Dong Da District had to receive treatment for HIV exposure after surrounding and arresting an HIV infected drug trafficker a year ago. However their loved ones continue to worry about their health. The mother in law of one young policeman, Ha Viet Trung, said: ""Trung’s wife is pregnant now and we still feel insecure because of the side effects of anti-retroviral drugs (ARV)."" Trung was injured, forcing him to take ARV when he was about to get married. Deputy chief of the anti-drug police picket, major Bui Anh Loi who also took part in the drug trafficker’s arrest, Nguyen Van Binh, remembers: ""In the beginning, affected policemen were very tired and lost weight because of anxiety and taking ARV."" Asked if fear of HIV exposure would hold them back from their duties, Loi said with a smile: ""It is our mission; in a life and death struggle you must exchange your hesitation for a human life."" Yet experience has shown that some of the protective equipment available is inconvenient and impractical for most policemen. At a recent crackdown of a drug den in Luong Su A alley in Ha Noi on July 4, Dong Da anti-drug police picket were ordered to arrest an AIDS infected drug trafficker. As the specialised gloves they were given were too big and tough, they were forced to apprehend the offender with unprotected hands. Inappropriate policy According to lieutenant colonel Lai Van An, head of political and logistic squad at Dong Da district’s police, the district foils about 400 drug cases a year. Many offenders who are living with HIV resist the police with violence. ""The danger to HIV exposure is high,"" An said. Since 2003 the district police has had 28 policemen exposed to HIV and five new cases have been reported since the beginning of this year alone. Statistics released by the Ministry of Public Security show that in the past five years more than 300 officials and policemen have become infected by the HIV when arresting offenders. Some were infected and then transmitted the virus on to their wives. The case of lieutenant Nguyen Thanh Dung, a criminal policeman in HCM City, is a typical example. Thanh and his wife passed away after Thanh caught the virus after arresting HIV/AIDS offenders. They left behind a 10 year old son. ""Regulations concerning compensation to policemen exposed to HIV are generally unsatisfactory,"" An opined. Under existing regulations which came into force last year, officials and policemen who are exposed to HIV are prescribed ARV free of charge and sometimes receive subsidies of between VND1 and VND2 million. It is, however, inadequate cover for the increasingly weakened health of infected policemen or the adverse impacts on their families. An said despite the fact that HIV, after treatment, only becomes AIDS in less than 0.01 percent of cases policemen exposed to HIV could not help worrying about their health He cited the case of a policeman who was scratched after arresting an HIV offender. The policeman did neither dare to discuss it with anyone nor have sexual intercourse with his wife for fear of transmitting the virus for two years. He only admitted the truth after a second scratch. None of the officials and policemen who were exposed to HIV at Dong Da District have been recognised as wounded soldiers because the degree of their injuries was not serious enough to assess. Therefore one of the tasks of the Dong Da political and logistic squad is to set up incident files and keep a close watch on the numbers of HIV infected officials and policemen. By doing so, it wants to help these officials and policemen to receive compensation when they are sick.",Society,"['policeman', 'threat', 'policemen', 'hiv', 'officials', 'face', 'beat', 'drug', 'exposure', 'infected', 'dong', 'exposed', 'da']","Police on the beat face threat of HIV(02-08-2007)HA NOI — Many policemen are silently suffering from the effects of exposure to HIV.

"HIV/AIDS patients reluctant to buy health insurance, fear discrimination",Health insurance has become critically important for HIV/AIDS patients as free anti-retroviral medicine and testing will no longer be readily available because of reduced international aid.,[],2015-10-30,vietnamnews.vn,"People living with HIV seeks consulting service at the Tropical Diseases Centre of the central Nghe An General Hospital. — Photo giadinh.net.vn Gia Loc HCM CITY (VNS) — Health insurance has become critically important for HIV/AIDS patients as free anti-retroviral medicine and testing will no longer be readily available because of reduced international aid. Because of Viet Nams classification as a lower middle-income country by the UN, funds from international aids will continue to fall, and eventually, patients with HIV/AIDS will have to pay for treatment. Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the countrys HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, said that health insurance would help reduce the patients payments. However, only 30 per cent of patients with HIV/AIDS buy insurance, and in HCM City, the figure is 20-25 per cent, according to the city AIDS Prevention Committee. As of this year, HCM City has 41,841 people with HIV. Venerable Thich Dong Nguyen, director of Phap Bao Community Counseling and Support Centre, said that many HIV/AIDS patients who receive counseling at his centre wanted to buy health insurance, but had not done so because of the stigma attached to the disease. ""Theyre afraid that many people will find out about their disease,"" he said. Most patients from other provinces and cities come to HCM City to earn a living, and many of them are casual labourers with an unstable income. To buy health insurance, they have to have temporary residential registration papers. Nguyen said that one patient with HIV/AIDS told him that he had to borrow papers from his landlord, who asked why he needed to do so. The patient told him that he had HIV and needed to buy health insurance, and as a result, the landlord no longer allowed him to live there. ""Discrimination by the community and even patients with HIV/AIDS have created these problems,"" Nguyen said. The amended Health Insurance Law on health insurance is also a barrier for HIV/AIDS patients. The law, which took effect earlier this year, requires that insurance must be bought for all members of a family. Tran Thi Phung of the Niem Tin community-based organisation (CBO), which provides healthcare and counselling to HIV patients, said that many women and children chose to stay at home or work as casual labourers because of poor health. ""They cant afford to buy health insurance cards for themselves, which cost VND600,000-700,000 ($27-31) each. Its even more difficult to buy for the whole family,"" she said. At an HIV outpatient clinic in District 4, of more than 1,200 patients with HIV, only 30 per cent have health insurance cards. Most of them work, but are poor or near-poor. Nguyen said the Ministry of Health should simplify health-insurance procedures, and allow HIV/AIDS patients to buy insurance at the HIV outpatient clinics. Dr Tieu Thi Thu Van, head of the citys AIDS Prevention Committee, has asked the central government to streamline the policy and allow HIV/AIDS patients to buy cards on their own. Access to benefits In June, the Ministry of Health issued a list of medical services paid by the Social Insurance Agency, but the list still does not provide sufficient services to insured HIV/AIDS patients. In HCM City, for example, 90 per cent of patients with HIV are treated at HIV outpatient clinics at district preventive health centres. However, the Social Insurance Agency, under the recently amended Health Insurance Law, is not allowed to sign insurance contracts for treatment at these centres as they are not legally covered under the law. Under the law, they can only sign agreements for payments to hospitals. As a result, insured patients with HIV treated at the centres receive no coverage. However, district hospitals and general hospitals in HCM City can only provide testing, and do not offer treatment for these patients. The patients are sent to specialised hospitals, such as Nhan Ai, Chi Hoa, Pham Ngoc Thach, paediatrics hospitals No.1 and 2 and the Tropical Diseases Hospital. Social welfare centres also provide treatment for them. Another problem under the amended law is that patients must go to a hospital that is named on their health insurance card. To solve these discrepancies, insured patients treated at district- or commune-level health facilities will be covered by health insurance in January next year, under regulations of the amended Health Insurance Law. HCM City plans to expand anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy to general district hospitals and private hospitals between 2016 and 2020. At that time, the city is considering two options to solve the coverage problem. One option involves sending patients with HIV/AIDS at district preventive centres to district general hospitals for treatment. The city would transfer the staff specialising in HIV/AIDS at the centres to hospitals, which offer insurance coverage under the amended Health Insurance Law. Patients treatment fees would then be paid by the Social Insurance Agency. The second option would be to classify district preventive health centres as ""health centres"", which would allow the centres to sign agreements with the national Social Insurance Agency as prescribed by the amended Health Insurance law. Thus, patients with HIV/AIDS could be covered at these centres. Under the citys proposal, social welfare centres that offer treatment now to HIV patients would be classified as satellite health facilities of district general hospitals. The patients would then qualify for insurance coverage. — VNS",Society,"['law', 'patients', 'city', 'hospitals', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'centres', 'discrimination', 'buy', 'reluctant', 'district', 'fear', 'health', 'insurance']","Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the country's HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, said that health insurance would help reduce the patients' payments.

Experts emphasise gender equality in VN’s HIV response,The current national response to HIV fails to adequately respond to the diverse needs and rights of the main affected groups – women and girls.,[],2018-01-18,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — The current national response to HIV fails to adequately respond to the diverse needs and rights of the main affected groups – women and girls. Phan Thị Thu Hương, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), made the statement at a conference held yesterday in Hà Nội. Although Việt Nam’s programmes of coping with HIV marked achievements in four fields including prevention, treatment, discrimination prevention and improving on challenges related to gender inequality, it still needed to take more action to ensure that women receive enough help, she said. Speaking at the workshop, Elisa Fernandez, UN Women Head of Office said, “Women living with HIV face gaps and constraints in accessing prevention, treatment, care and support services. Women, particularly those most affected by the epidemic, also largely remain on the margins of policy and decision-making spaces.” These are some of the reasons why there is a rise in reported cases of HIV-positive women in Việt Nam from 24 per cent in 2007 to 33 per cent in 2014. “To achieve gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, HIV response needs to focus on three areas,” Fernandez said. First, improving access to sexual and reproductive health and HIV services. Second, mobilising communities to transform unequal gender norms and behaviours, particularly by engaging men. Third, empowering women and girls in all their diversity by investing in women’s leadership in HIV response, she said. Deputy director Hương emphasised that in the future, the Ministry of Health (MoH) would improve education on HIV/AIDS prevention and control, especially for women and children, in which they will prevent discrimination against people living with HIV. The MoH will improve women’s access to equipment to reduce the spread of HIV, including condoms, and give more training to consultancy workers to help women and girls resolve their problems related to tests, diagnosis and personal information security. During the half-day workshop, more than 80 participants from international organisations, governmental agencies, academia, civil society and other stakeholders discussed key findings of the VAAC study, identified the gaps and challenges in mainstreaming gender equality and empowering women in the national HIV response, and provided a set of recommendations for improved HIV policies and programmes. Việt Nam was committed to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 and had demonstrated political leadership and commitment to join global efforts to address gender inequality and HIV. By September last year, Việt Nam has 208,371 people living with HIV, more than 90,400 people living with AIDS and 90,000 people died of HIV/AIDS, according to the VAAC. In the nine first months last year, the country discovered more than 6,800 people living with HIV, more than 3,400 people living with AIDS and 1,260 people died of HIV/AIDS. It was a decrease by 14 per cent, 39 per cent and 35 per cent compared with the same period last year, respectively. — VNS",Society,"['gender', 'response', 'vns', 'equality', 'women', 'việt', 'experts', 'hiv', 'emphasise', 'living', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'cent', 'prevention']","Phan Thị Thu Hương, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), made the statement at a conference held yesterday in Hà Nội.

Speaking at a conference on HIV/ AIDS treatment facilities held yesterday in HCM City, Dr Dương Minh Hải of the HIV/ AIDS Preventive Centre, said that the city now has 28,340 people with HIV/ AIDS, including 27,645 undergoing ARV treatment. It is estimated that the number of people with HIV/AIDS will rise to 31,500 people, leading to an increase of 31,000 with ARV treatment by the end of 2016. Since March, the centre has provided counselling for health insurance for people with HIV/AIDS at 29 health examination and treatment clinics for outpatients in city districts and four city-level hospitals. Only 20 per cent of people with HIV/AIDS in HCM City have insurance cards. Bùi Đức Dư, deputy head of the Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control, said the payments under health insurance should start now, not later. “There is no reason for delaying this,” Dư said. HCM City and other provinces and cities must draw up a plan for the implementation of payments, he added. Nguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy head of the city’s Department of Health, said that the department would petition the People’s Committee to direct the Insurance Social Agency to allow organisations that operate in fields related to HIV/AIDS to buy health insurance cards for disadvantaged people with HIV/AIDS. The national health insurance law, which took effect earlier this year, requires that insurance must be bought for all members of a family. If a member fails to buy, the other family members listed in the same resident registration book are not allowed to buy insurance. Health care representatives said this was one of the main barriers preventing HIV/AIDS patients from buying health insurance. --VNS",Society,"['preventive', 'patients', 'hcm', 'city', 'hospitals', '2017', 'set', 'hivaids', 'cover', 'medicine', 'payments', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","At that time, HIV/AIDS patients will have to be responsible for payments for medicine and other treatment.

Over half of HIV-afflicted on life-saving treatment: UNAIDS,"More than half of those living with HIV have access to treatment, while AIDS-related deaths have almost halved in the past 10 years in the world, a new report has stated.",[],2017-07-21,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — More than half of those living with HIV have access to treatment, while AIDS-related deaths have almost halved in the past 10 years in the world, a new report has stated. In Việt Nam, half of the people living with HIV were under treatment in 2016, and the estimated number of AIDS-related deaths was the lowest since 2004. New HIV infections have also steadily decreased in recent years, it said. The report, which has been launched by UNAIDS on Thursday, showed that in 2016, 19.5 million people living with HIV had access to treatment, and AIDS-related deaths had fallen from 1.9 million in 2005 to 1 million in 2016. In Asia and the Pacific, more than two thirds of the people living with HIV were aware of their HIV status, a similar number of those who knew their HIV status were on treatment and four out of the five people under treatment had achieved viral suppression in 2016. The wider availability of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment has led to nearly one third reduction in AIDS-related deaths since 2010 in the region. Việt Nam has significantly contributed to this progress. “Việt Nam’s impressive scale-up of HIV services has resulted in a clear impact on the epidemic,” said Marie-Odile Emond, Country Director of UNAIDS Việt Nam. New infections are declining, but not fast enough. Global and Việt Nam’s progress against the 90–90–90 targets has been significant, but there is still more work to do. The report shows that, globally, new HIV infections are declining, but not at enough pace to meet global targets by 2020. The situation in Việt Nam is similar. New HIV infections in Việt Nam have decreased to about 11,000 in 2016 from about 28,000 during the peak years in the early 2000s. However, greater scale-up of evidence-based prevention and more domestic resources for prevention, including needle, syringes and condoms, are needed to achieve the national targets on HIV prevention. Integrated and community-based HIV services, as well as successful innovative and user-friendly approaches, are essential for greater HIV service access and uptake by key populations, and must be scaled up. In Việt Nam, of the 70 per cent of people living with HIV who know their HIV status, one third is not on HIV treatment yet. Stigma and discrimination is still a major barrier in accessing HIV services and hampering the national response to HIV. Globally, resources for AIDS response remain flat. In Việt Nam, the latest available data shows domestic resources accounted for nearly one third of the national AIDS spending in 2015, and it is increasing. “Việt Nam continues to show great determination to sustain the response to HIV by increasing domestic financing for HIV through social health insurance and greater share in the financing responsibility by local governments,” Emond said. “Investing sufficiently and wisely, now rather than later, and optimising all available financial and human resources at all levels will help Việt Nam avoid a complex and costly HIV response in the future, and end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.” — VNS",Society,"['response', 'resources', 'việt', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'aidsrelated', 'infections', 'deaths', 'half', 'unaids', 'hivafflicted', 'treatment', 'lifesaving']","In Việt Nam, half of the people living with HIV were under treatment in 2016, and the estimated number of AIDS-related deaths was the lowest since 2004.

Treatment programme cuts HIV transmission rate,"A 25-year-old mother from HCM City's Binh Thanh District was unsure about what to do when she became pregnant as she had contracted the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from her husband, who had once been a user of recreational drugs.",[],2014-06-03,vietnamnews.vn,"According to the World Health Organisation, in the absence of any intervention, transmission rates to the child can range from 15-45 per cent. The rate can fall below 5 per cent with effective intervention. — Photo dantri by Gia Loc HCM CITY (VNS) — A 25-year-old mother from HCM Citys Binh Thanh District was unsure about what to do when she became pregnant as she had contracted the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from her husband, who had once been a user of recreational drugs. Nguyen Thi Thanh Thao (not her real name) said that her mother-in-law had suggested an abortion. To resolve the matter, Thao and her family visited the Phat Tam HIV/AIDS Prevention Division in Binh Thanh Districts Ward 21 for counselling. The division is part of the HCM City AIDS Prevention Committee. There, they met Truong Ngoc Nhu, the divisions head who persuaded Thao to continue her pregnancy and take part in a programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Thao was introduced to the Community Support and Counselling Centre in Binh Thanh District. Pregnant women who have HIV and are 14 weeks pregnant are eligible for the prevention programme if their CD4 cell count, the type of white blood cell that fights infection, is more than 350. If it is less than 350, then they qualify for the anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment programme. Thao was given medicine two times a day until the end of the first week after delivery. Thaos son also was provided medicine at delivery and until he was one month old. He was also provided formula milk and was not breast-fed. When he was one month old, he was brought to the citys Paediatrics Hospital No. 2 for HIV tests, which were negative. Like Thaos son, the son of 44-year-old HIV-positive mother Phan Thi Anh Tuyet (not her real name) has been free of HIV also, tests results show. The thin mother with pale skin, who rents a room of only six square metres, takes care of her child with her husband. Tuyet said she had never been tested for HIV until she went into labour. Tests were positive and she received medication under the citys mother-to-child prevention programme. Her sons tests at Paediatrics Hospital No. 2 proved to be negative. According to the World Health Organisation, in the absence of any intervention, transmission rates to the child can range from 15-45 per cent. The rate can fall below 5 per cent with effective intervention. Truong Huu Khanh, a member of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Controls Division for HIV/AIDS among Children, said the citys mother-to-child transmission prevention programme was the best in the country. Last year, the city recorded a total of 642 pregnant women infected with HIV. Of them, 588 accessed the prevention programme during pregnancy, labour and delivery, and 80.8 per cent received early prevention during pregnancy. The rest was for labour and delivery. The city said that 99.7 per cent of babies received prevention measures after delivery in 2013. As a result, the city HIV transmission from mother to child or breastfeeding fall to 2.3 per cent in 2013 from 6.9 per cent in 2006. An initial evaluation of the effectiveness of prevention treatment of HIV transmission from mother to child at the National Gyneco-Obstetrics Hospital in Ha Noi between October 2010 and June 2011 showed that the rate of transmission was 1.49 per cent. Lifelong prevention Dr Tran Thi Doan Trang, a specialist in the prevention programme and a member of HCM City AIDS Committee, said that the Ministry of Health had approved HCM City AIDS Prevention Committee to carry out a lifelong anti-retroviral (ARVs) treatment for all HIV-positive pregnant women, regardless of their CD4 cell count. The lifelong treatment is known as Option B+, she said. Previously, pregnant women with HIV received the ARV treatment when their CD4 count was under 350. If the CD4 count was more than 350 in post-pregnancy, the treatment would end. Last November, the Option B+ pilot programme began in the provinces of An Giang, Quang Ninh, Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, Lao Cai and Nghe An, she added. The treatment was recommended by the World Health Organisation last year. Le Truong Giang, chairman of the citys Public Health Association, said the Option B+ would help end HIV transmission from mother to child within the next two years. Khanh said it would help protect babies from HIV transmission, and lead to elimination of new HIV infections among children. Option B+ would also improve pregnant womens resistance to disease, and it could also prevent sexual transmission to sero-discordant partners. ""It is very important to be very safe for babies, and for it to not be costly,"" said Khanh. The simplification of the daily regimen, with a single-pill fixed dose combination, would help prevent women from giving up too early, especially women in HCM Citys rural areas, Khanh said. In late 2011, the Option B+ programme was carried out throughout Malawi in Africa. After only three months, Malawi saw very positive results, with the total number of all patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in the national programme increasing by an astounding 88 per cent. A research report of the cost-effective analysis of Option B+ for HIV Prevention and Treatment of Mother and Children in Malawi published last March showed that the Option B+ not only prevented infant infection but also improved the 10-year survival rate in mothers more than four-fold. This translates into savings of more than 250,000 maternal life years, compared to different prevention and treatment measures related to CD4 cell count, which have savings of 153,000 to 172,000 life-years. The Option B+ also yields favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$455 per life each year compared to current practices. The research study was conducted by Malawis Ministry of Healths HIV and AIDS Department in co-operation with local and foreign organisations and universities. — VNS",Society,"['city', 'hiv', 'option', 'cuts', 'transmission', 'prevention', 'cent', 'programme', 'mother', 'treatment', 'rate', 'b']","If it is less than 350, then they qualify for the anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment programme.

Around 66,000 people died from HIV/AIDS in the same period. Bui Hoang Duc, from the ministrys Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said that although the pandemic had declined in recent years, the numbers were still relatively high. The ratio of women with HIV has increased during the past years, with the number of sexually transmitted HIV infections outnumbering those via blood-to-blood contact. According to the ministry, the proportion of people over 30 and living with HIV was also on the rise. However, Duc said the ministry was especially concerned about a large number of people with HIV being unaware of their condition; posing a huge threat to the community and threatening a rise in infection rates. An increasing number of cases had been discovered in drug addicts partners, he added. Discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients is still rife throughout Viet Nam, even providing obstacles for patients seeking treatment. The 2013 National Action Month for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, launched on November 10, will focus on reducing the risk of infection by organising conferences and seminars to raise awareness.

Dam made the call at a session of the National Committee for Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS, Drugs and Prevention, held in Ha Noi yesterday to review the efforts from the first half of the year and to set tasks for the remainder of 2014. The Deputy PM, who is also the chair of the committee, said the task of providing education and communicating methods to prevent and control the disease would be difficult given State budget allocations and official development assistance (ODA) had been falling since the beginning of the year. Dam called on officials to mobilise all available resources to fight contributing factors linked to the spread of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS and the risks posed by drugs and prostitution needed to be included in workshops at high schools, said Dam, adding that students were one of the groups most vulnerable to the disease. The Deputy PM also urged the Ministry of Public Security to collaborate with agencies and organisations in compiling statistics on the number of drug addicts nationwide. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has also been asked to consider new medicines, besides Methadone, that could be used to rehabilitate drug users. Dam also requested localities to urgently map out financial options for revamping rehabilitation programmes by 2020. According to a report released by the committee, since the beginning of the year, the country has recorded 3,133 HIV-infected cases, 1,388 AIDS cases and 462 deaths from the disease. The virus is spreading in major cities like Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, especially among high-risk groups, such as male prostitutes and drug addicts. Drug crimes and prostitution have continued to escalate and it is estimated that there are more than 25,680 prostitutes in the country, mainly concentrated in the Red River Delta, the northern central and southeastern regions, and the Mekong Delta. As many as 478 models to prevent prostitution and support former sex workers to reintegrate into the community have been piloted in 40 provinces and cities. Competent agencies have also detected many transnational drug rings linked to large volumes of narcotics.

They would not be transferred to provincial level or regional hospitals because of various reasons, Huỳnh Cao Hải, the department’s deputy head, told a meeting held with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) on Wednesday to discuss its technical assistance toward sustainable HIV/AIDS prevention in the province. Transferring them to provincial- and regional-level hospitals would ensure they can use their health insurance since some local clinics do not have tie-ups with the social insurance agency. But Hải said it could make some of them give up treatment because of the need to travel long distances or complex about their situation. The province has set its sights on the UN 90-90-90 goals: 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and 90 per cent of people receiving ARV will achieve viral suppression by 2020. Now 68 per cent of people with HIV in the province know their HIV status, 46.5 per cent of them receive sustained ARV therapy, and 93 per cent of those receiving ARV have achieved viral suppression. Hải said USAID could provide assistance in achieving these goals soon. According to a USAID representative, a programme for this purpose will start in the province next September and go on until 2030. The province will get assistance in accessing, testing and treating HIV and accessing health insurance. USAID will also train health staff in identifying new HIV patients and people living with HIV without knowing it. These people will be counselled on testing and treating for viral suppression to prevent the spread in the community. According to the local Centre for HIV, the province has had nearly 8,000 patients with HIV/AIDS since 1993, with nearly 4,300 ones under management and more than 1,100 ones not known their trace.

HIV/AIDS fight faces cash crunch,"Viet Nam faces two major hurdles in combating HIV/AIDS: namely unsustainable achievements and the reduction of international financial support, says Minister of Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien.",[],2013-03-06,vietnamnews.vn,"Volunteers in Binh Thuan Province push safe sex measures to prevent HIV/AIDS — VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc HA NOI (VNS) — Viet Nam faces two major hurdles in combating HIV/AIDS: namely unsustainable achievements and the reduction of international financial support, says Minister of Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien. At a nation-wide conference on HIV/AIDS, drug and prostitution control yesterday, Tien said that last year the country had more than 14,100 people living with HIV, a fall of 26 per cent compared with 2011. More than 2,100 people died for AIDS last year which is half of the figure in 2011. ""However, the results are not sustainable and HIV/AIDS infection still faces a high risk of spreading further if we do not have effective control measures,"" said Tien. The number of people infected with HIV via sexual intercourse has increased compared with the those infected via blood contact, and it is forecast that unprotected sexual contact will be the main means of HIV transmission in coming years. ""But controlling transmission via sexual intercourse is much more difficult than with transmission via blood contact, as approaching and supervising prostitutes and men who have sex with men faces a lot of obstacles,"" she said. Nearly 46 per cent of people living with HIV were infected with the virus via sexual intercourse last year whereas only 42 per cent were infected via heroin injections. The rate in 2011 was 41.8 and 46.4 per cent respectively. Besides, provinces with new outbreaks of infection, including Binh Duong, Vinh Phuc and Ha Nam, so far have not invested much in carrying out control measures. Moreover, in the provinces bordering the metropolises Ha Noi and HCM City faces a greater risk of transmission, said Tien. In the meantime, foreign financial support, which makes up 70 per cent of the total funds for epidemic control, is expected to decrease sharply by 2015 as Viet Nam becomes a middle-income nation. ""It is a big difficulty for the country as the number of people living with HIV is still high with 4,000-5,000 new cases per year,"" said Tien. It is forecast that the country will have about 300,000 people living with HIV by 2015, and 140,000 of them will need antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment during their whole life. ""Thus if funds for control is not enough, the country will not reach expected targets and thus faces a high risk of transmission to the community,"" said Tien. The Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the organisation that offers the biggest fund for HIV/AIDS control, plans to cut its financial support by US$10 million a year. PEPFAR supported the control with more than $82 million in 2011, but by 2015 the fund will be only $40 million. To mobilise funds for HIV control, Deputy Minister of Finance Nguyen Thi Minh proposed to diversify organisations and individuals joining the programme. Under the proposed project, enterprises and organisations supplying HIV/AIDS prevention and control services will enjoy preferential tax policies. The Law on Health Insurance will be amended so people living with HIV and drug addicts will benefit from the fund. The fund can pay 20 per cent of the total treatment expenses, thus people living with HIV should be encouraged to buy the insurance, said Minh. Speaking at the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the HIV/AIDS control steering committee at different levels to research and complete the law system on HIV/AIDS prevention and control, and strengthen information output on the subject to the whole people, especially the youth, about the disease and how to avoid it. International co-operation should be improved and different sponsor sources should be mobilised and used effectively, he said.

Some provinces and cities, such as HCM City and the provinces of Nghe An and Son La, have large numbers of drug addicts, and some 30 per cent of them received the treatment, Nguyen Hoang Long, Director of the department, said. Fourteen provinces and cities, including Lam Dong, Dak Lak, Binh Phuoc and Ca Mau, have not introduced treatment with methadone. Long said the reason was that the provinces and cities had not paid enough attention to the treatment programme; they had not assigned workers or the equipment needed to conduct it, and the administrative procedures to receive patients were complicated. The opening of new health centres providing treatment with methadone had met with obstacles due to a lack of workers and the difficult terrain in remote areas. The Ministry of Health has called for aid from various sources to buy methadone and medical equipment for different areas. The ministry has provided technological support and examined the work done by the provinces and cities, Long said. The ministry has authorised three domestic firms to manufacture methadone: the Vidipha Central Pharmaceutical Joint Stock Company, the Danapha Pharmaceutical Joint Stock Company and the Ha Tay Pharmaceutical Company. Since 2013, the ministry has been buying methadone produced in Viet Nam at a price 20-30 per cent lower than that of the imported drug. Institutes and schools under the ministry often hold courses to train medical workers from different localities in the use of methadone. The ministry is set to issue a circular on methadone management and provide guidance on organising methadone delivery stations. — VNS",Society,"['ministry', 'provided', 'methadone', 'patients', 'pharmaceutical', 'provide', 'hivaids', 'cities', 'workers', 'treatment', 'provinces']","Forty-six of the 63 provinces and cities in the country have provided treatment for HIV/AIDS with methadone this year. — VNA/VNS Photo Lan AnhHA NOI (VNS) — Forty-six of the 63 provinces and cities in the country have provided treatment for HIV/AIDS with methadone this year.

People with HIV need health insurance, which will cover the cost of their anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs after 2018 when international donors end their sponsorship. They need to take ARV drugs for the rest of their life, with the average cost being nearly VNĐ20 million (U$877) a year. At a conference on ensuring patients can afford to buy ARV drugs held yesterday in the Mekong Delta City of Cần Thơ, delegates said helping people with HIV get health insurance is the long-term solution. Dương Thúy Anh, the administration’s head of finance and accounting, said the insurance coverage was 84 per cent last September but fell to 83.4 per cent this March. In Hà Nội and the provinces of Cao Bằng, Bắc Kạn, Lạng Sơn, and Cà Mau, everyone with HIV has health insurance. In 30 provinces, more than 90 per cent are insured. The Ministry of Health’s goal is to achieve 100 per cent coverage by 2020. But Anh said it is difficult to achieve the goal because nearly 10 per cent do not have personal papers, which are required to buy health insurance.

Nguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy director of the city’s Department of Health, was quoted by Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) newspaper as saying that the city had been selected by the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) as one of five pilot cities to reach the target by 2030. The UN Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has chosen the city as one of the largest fast-track cities in the world achieving its 90-90-90 targets set by the UN in 2014. The 90-90-90 goals mean that by 2020 90 per cent of HIV-infected people will know their infection status, 90 per cent of HIV positive people will receive anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs, and 90 per cent of people taking ARV drugs will have a low HIV load. HCM City is expected to reach its 90-90-90 target ahead of schedule, having achieved a 73-75-96 target so far. In recent years, international support for AIDS/HIV has been declining, so the city has tried to ensure that there will be no interruptions in HIV/AIDS prevention by issuing new policies to maintain ARV for an HIV patient’s entire life and to limit drug resistance and spread of the disease. The city continues to provide HIV treatment for patients, including paying 100 per cent for health insurance cards and 20 per cent co-payment for ARV drugs for people living with HIV in the city, including those with temporary residence certificates of six months. Methadone treatment for patients addicted to drugs is also paid by the city. According to the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control under the health ministry, the city has 31,877 people living with HIV/AIDS receiving ARV treatment. This figure represents more than 25 per cent of the estimated total figure of people living with HIV in the country Dr Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control warned that AIDS could spread among people not yet diagnosed for HIV. The estimated number could be about 50,000 people, especially among five groups: transgender people, gay men, users of drug injections, people working away from home, and prostitutes. ""Việt Nam is adopting the latest international models of HIV prevention, but it is necessary to have new peers to prevent spread to these five groups,” he said. With ARV drugs and other efforts, many experts say that people living with HIV can live for 50 years from the date of infection, he said.

""I felt like I was literally falling into hell. I am an adult and at least I had the chance to taste the joys of life but my baby is innocent. Her life was stolen from her because of somebody else’s fault."" said Khuyen. Khuyen did not know that she had been infected and had contracted the disease from her husband, who subsequently died three months after discovering he had the virus. Due to ignorance of the disease, the young mother and her baby were forced to move from their small house and live separately from her husband’s family. ""All of them love us dearly, but they were too scared to open their arms to us as they didn’t have any idea about the disease, all they knew was that it is an epidemic that causes death. The only thing that helped me get over the hardest time of my life was the love I have for my child and my belief in God."" said Khuyen. Everyday the young widow would go to church to pray in the hope that her child would return a negative result on her tests after 18 months. However, this was not to be as the resulting tests returned positive, coupled with her dire financial situation, Khuyen had become an emotional and physical wreck. It was during this time that she was introduced to the Camellia Club, by a friend from church. The club is a Ford Foundation funded joint-project between the Centre for Community Health and Development (COHED), a Vietnamese Non-Government Organisation and the Hai Phong Centre for Health Communication and Education (HCHCE), that aims to aid women who have contracted HIV/AIDS through their husbands. Key members of the club are equipped with a wide range of knowledge about the disease and care giving methods for taking care for HIV/AIDS victims. They endeavour to enable sufferers to access the free health services of the National HIV/AIDS Programme while providing their time to care for patients. ""Not every family welcomes us when we come to help. Some families have even released their dogs on us. Receiving us in their home is admitting that one of their family members has now got the virus,"" said Le Thi Than, another member of the club. Through the mass media and public education programmes, public discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients has become much improved over the last few years. The situation, however, is still a major problem in rural and remote areas as the local population often has a rudimentary grasp of the disease and discrimination is often rife. ""Life used to be hard for me and I don’t want others to get into a similar situation. What I have done to help the group is not that special, but it really makes my life more personally meaningful for the short time that I am here,"" said Than. Than said that she was crushed by the unwanted stares of her co-workers at the office when they discovered she was HIV/AIDS positive. Though her colleagues were not direct in their united desire that she leave, their actions sent a clear message that she was no longer welcome as a cook at the Hai Phong Ship building yards. Experts agree that her situation is very typical of what HIV/AIDS sufferers routinely endure in work environments around the country. Director of the HCHCE, Nguyen Quang Thinh, said ""Our mission now is to break through the prejudices of society about this disease and the people that live with it."" After more than a year in operation, the club’s members have approached and helped more than 200 people and given them access to much needed health services.

While ARV drugs do not cure HIV nor prevent HIV transmission, when used in combination these medications reduce the amount of virus in the blood and help delay the progress of the disease. Children with HIV/AIDS desperately need ARV drugs to stay healthy as the number of infections starts to climb. Official health ministry statistics report children under 13 years with HIV/AIDS has risen slightly, from 0.3 per cent of infections in 1997 to 0.82 per cent last year. Although HIV/AIDS expert Duong Ba Truc says the real figures are much higher partly due to the social stigma of reporting the virus, lack of effective detection and testing facilities across all areas in country. Infected children, in particular newborns, are susceptible to opportunistic infections, which people with HIV/AIDS suffer due to their lower immunity levels. Nguyen Thi Phuong says all the 18 abandoned and orphaned children under her care at the Ha Tay Centre of Education and Labour No 2 in Ha Tay are chronically ill. ""They look sick with highly swollen bellies; some have conditions like pneumonia and diarrhoea,"" says Phuong, 48, the centre’s director explained about the children, who range from toddlers to eight-year olds. The centre, about 40km from Ha Noi, hosted its first juvenile HIV case in early 2001. Phuong says the children have been sent from the capital’s major paediatrics and obstetrics hospitals. ""I was told children with HIV/AIDS could live for five or six years but some of them have lived for two years’ more,"" says Phuong. ""If they are treated with ARV I strongly believe that their lives would be prolonged."" The director points out ARV drugs could also raise the quality of life for these children as they would be less prone to opportunistic infections. Three-year-old Giao has HIV and arrived at the centre shortly after his birth, now his stomach is often bloated and he suffers chronic diarrhoea. Six children have died of AIDS at the centre since 2002 says Phuong. Money troubles Dr Truc says the youngest HIV/AIDS patients in Viet Nam, who are mostly under the age of two, have not accessed ARV treatment. Truc, head of the Central Paediatrics Hospital’s haematology department, says they have medications to treat opportunistic infection diseases. ""We’ve never had ARV drugs for the children before,"" he says. A report from the World Health Organisation last year revealed treating children with antiretrovirals presents special challenges. Few HIV medicines are produced in paediatric formulations, and those available as syrups are less effective compared to prophylactics Truc says the hospital, with US$20,000 from the Global Fund, has just started buying ARV for child patients, but the costs are still prohibitive as some of the drugs have to be imported. ""I expect all children with HIV/AIDS will start free ARV treatment next month."" The doctor says even existing forms of HIV treatment are exceedingly expensive. A child needs about VND600,000 ($40) per month, which does not include the costs of medicines to fight persistant infections. At the moment the children at Phuong’s centre receive only VND35,000 as a medication and clothing allowance each month. Deputy director of pharmaceutical maker Viet Nam STADA, Phan Huy, says his company does not manufacture any antiretroviral drugs for children as there is not a great commercial demand for them yet. ""Therefore if we produced them the retail prices would be extremely high,"" Huy explains. Tran Quoc Tuan, head of Dong Da Hospital’s Department for Infectious Diseases, recalled when frantic grandparents from Lang Son Province contacted him to find out about treatment for their only grandson. ""They called me at least seven times over 10 days intent on buying ARV for the eight-year-old,"" says Tuan. The boy’s parents had died of AIDS and although he is still healthy, his family are very concerned. Tuan told to them to try the Central Paediatrics Hospital, but they came away devastated that there was no ARV for children.",Society,"['treatment', 'arv', 'opportunistic', 'suffer', 'ha', 'vital', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'paediatrics', 'centre', 'children', 'drugs', 'infants']","Infants suffer without vital HIV/AIDS drugs(18-01-2005)Van AnhA six-month-old with HIV/AIDS receives a check-up in the Ha Tay-based centre of Education and Labour No 2.

Hard lives of children with HIV,"Children infected with HIV/AIDS or those whose parents have died or are living with the epidemic suffer hard lives and the ever-present spectre of death, social stigma and discrimination from those around them, making their lives a constant state of misery.",[],2008-01-21,vietnamnews.vn,"Hard lives of children with HIV (22-01-2008) Forum listens to the unheard voices of the epidemic’s most innocent victims International visitors present gifts to children living with HIV/AIDS at Dien Giac Pagoda in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc HA NOI — Children infected with HIV/AIDS or those whose parents have died or are living with the epidemic suffer hard lives and the ever-present spectre of death, social stigma and discrimination from those around them, making their lives a constant state of misery. This issue can only be dealt with by strengthening communication to help improve the community’s understanding of this dangerous epidemic, according to Nguyen Trong An, vice director of the Department for Children’s Issues of the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs. Loneliness and isolation Ban Thi Thanh Truc, a six-year-old girl in Bai Da Village of Luc Son Commune, Luc Nam District of Bac Giang Province, has lived a solitary life since she was only four years old. She carries the virus within her. Truc’s parents were both infected by the HIV/AIDS virus and died when she was just a small child. Truc now lives with her uncle’s family, though they all consider her a burden. The family leaves her to a small separate corner in the house, and she eats alone, with separate bowls and chopsticks. Ever since she was four years old, Truc has had to wash her own clothes and take care of herself. The family members don’t even come near her, much less make contact with her. Truc is only one of the unlucky children in the country infected with HIV/AIDS by their parents, living in the harsh glares and discriminating looks of people around them. Duong Thi Ngoc, a 12-year-old girl living with HIV/AIDS from An Giang Province, said that she was living in a very difficult situation. ""My parents died seven years ago. My brother and I are now living with our grandparents. We are very poor. I don’t know if I can continue my studies,"" said Ngoc. Meanwhile, many others suffer constantly from other people’s attitudes towards them. ""I used to have a best friend, but when she found out I had HIV, she stayed away from me and even told others not to be friends with me. That hurt me a lot,"" said Nguyen Thi Huong, from the 19/5 Centre in HCM City. Ngoc and Huong were among 60 children nationwide participating in a national forum on children’s voices on HIV/AIDS, which was co-organised last Saturday by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) in collaboration with Save the Children UK and World Vision. The forum created a chance for these children to raise their voices on HIV/AIDS-related issues as well as to deliver their messages about care, support and treatment for children infected/affected by HIV/AIDS to Government leaders. Other children attending the forum also told stories about the discrimination against them, including cases of doctors refusing to carry out health check-ups and principals asking students with HIV to leave school. According to the statistics provided by the Viet Nam Administration of AIDS Control under the Ministry of Health, at present the country has roughly 300,000 people living with HIV. By the end of May 2007, the relative number of children below 13 nationwide infected by the virus was 1,398. However, the number of children whose lives are affected by the epidemic is much higher. ""There are currently some 300,000 children affected by HIV/AIDS, meaning that they are either infected with the virus or have parents who have died or are living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Dam Huu Dac, Deputy Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs. Given the growth in the epidemic since these estimates were developed, the number of children living with and affected by the virus is likely to have grown substantially. A survey carried out by the former Viet Nam Committee for Population, Families and Children, in collaboration with Save the Children UK, studying 236 children living with HIV in Ha Noi, Hai Phong, HCM City, An Giang and Quang Ninh provinces revealed that the majority of these children perceive themselves to be living in dire economic circumstances. The relative economic status of children living with HIV/AIDS is particularly poor. Parents dead or leaving home, parents’ illnesses and a lack of employment were the top reasons behind this relative poverty. These children must also bear the stigma and discrimination from people living around them, which is the biggest obstacle in the country’s cause to support and provide help to them. Concerted efforts While working hard to reduce the number of children infected by HIV and AIDS, authorities and those in the health sector are putting much effort into caring for and supporting those infected and affected by the epidemic. A number of legal documents have been issued to deal with the problem, including orders, circulars, decrees and laws on protection, care and education of children. In 2004, the Law on Protection, Care and Education of Children, first issued in 1991, was amended, supplemented by the National Assembly, clearly specifying the rights of children and emphasising that HIV/AIDS-affected children should not be discriminated against. The hardships these children must face is recognised by authorities. ""Actually it is very hard to deal with this issue. While economic difficulties can be solved by calling for support from the Government and a variety of funding sources, the social stigma can only be reduced by humanity. People may say they are not scared of people having HIV/AIDS, but in fact they are,"" said Nguyen Trong An, vice director of the Department for Children’s Issues of MOLISA. ""In order to reduce the stigma and discrimination against these children, communication should be strengthened in order to help the community improve their understanding of HIV,"" said An. An added that discrimination cases would be dealt with in a strict manner if specific people were identified. However, the most important thing that would help is calling for people to become more sympathetic and understanding with these children, for they are as innocent and as normal as everyone else and they deserve every right that a child should have, including the rights to all medical treatments, to be protected and to go to school, said Jeremy Stoner, country director of Save the Children UK. ""Child care and child protection now is one of the Government’s major concerns. Viet Nam has made efforts to harmonise its national laws and has had international conventions assisting children in difficult circumstances, including those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. The forum shows commitment, determination and the increased efforts of the Government and international organisations to fight stigma and discrimination against children living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Deputy Minister of MOLISA Dam Huu Dac.",Society,"['social', 'lives', 'parents', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'hard', 'infected', 'discrimination', 'virus', 'stigma', 'children']","Hard lives of children with HIV(22-01-2008)Forum listens to the unheard voices of the epidemic’s most innocent victimsInternational visitors present gifts to children living with HIV/AIDS at Dien Giac Pagoda in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo Duong NgocHA NOI — Children infected with HIV/AIDS or those whose parents have died or are living with the epidemic suffer hard lives and the ever-present spectre of death, social stigma and discrimination from those around them, making their lives a constant state of misery.

Employee shortage poses risk to HIV fight,"Authorities in Son La Province, a northern border province infamous for drug smuggling and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, decided to lay off all non-permanent medical workers at methadone centres in the area.",[],2015-12-25,vietnamnews.vn,"A medical staffer gives methadone to an HIV-positive man in northern mountainous Son La Provinces Moc Chau District. — VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc by Chi Lan SON LA (VNS) — Authorities in Son La Province, a northern border province infamous for drug smuggling and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, decided to lay off all non-permanent medical workers at methadone centres in the area. According to Decision 93 issued by the municipal Peoples Committee, medical staff who work at local methadone centres on a yearly contract will lose their jobs next Friday. It means that seven out of 10 employees of the Thuan Chau Districts methadone centre, which provides the treatment drug to about 124 local people with drug addictions every morning, will be out of work. The other three are permanent employees, including the centres director. Lo Thi Tinh, 23, a contract employee at the centre, said everyone thinks the work she does – giving the patients the right dose of methadone - is easy and requires little effort. ""But in fact I have to work every day, even on the weekend with every morning spent with the patients while doing the paperwork - for example, the treatment report for the patients in the afternoon,"" Tinh said. She receives a monthly wage of VND2.139 million (US$95), with neither social insurance nor bonus for her work on weekends. Tinh said she struggles to raise her family of three on such a paltry sum of money, but added that she was still grateful for the position because it was difficult to find a job relevant to her pharmaceutical degree in the area. The reason behind the furlough was not clearly stated in the Decisions document, but Son La HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Dam Van Huong said that financial reasons likely triggered the decision to downsize. Luong Minh Tuan, director of the Thuan Chau Health Centre, said the job cuts are expected to create problems for the health system, which already has a shortage of employees. He said the three remaining staff would not be able to consult and provide treatment and follow-up health checks to the 100-plus patients who come to the methadone centre every day. ""So far we have no choice but to ask two employees from the two communal health stations to pick up the job here at the methadone centre,"" Tuan said. ""Those two will share their time between the heath station and the centre."" Permanent staff frozen The health stations affected by Decision 93 currently have five staff each to provide health services to a dozen thousand local people, and are already overloaded with their daily tasks. One of the two, Tong Lanh Communal Health Station, which also provided ARV (antiretroviral) drugs to 50 HIV-positive patients, was spread thin due to a shortage of health workers, said head of the station Bac Thi Thuan. ""Freezing the number of permanent employees is making our work really hard,"" she said. Keeping the number of permanent state employees stagnant, or going further by making additional staff cuts, has been a national priority policy in recent years. Both the Government and residents have repeatedly called for action regarding the issue. The Chieng Son communes health station is located about 25km south of the abandoned villa of notorious drug ringleader Giang A Tang, who smuggled drugs worth millions of dollars from Laos to Viet Nam via Son La. At the same time, the region struggles to help people facing drug addiction. The methadone centre, built next to the health station, expects to see staff cuts similar to Thuan Chau Districts, and staff are bracing themselves for their 10 employees to be reduced to just three at the beginning of January. Two workers of the station will be sent to the centre to help care for the 131 patients being treated with methadone, said health station head Tran Thi Van. ""But the hitch is that we are already strained with the current workload,"" she said. Her health station is supposed to cover health services for about 9,000 residents with only seven workers available. The lack of employees is posing a serious risk to the newly adopted pivot plan by the Government - the 90-90-90, said Son La HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Dam Van Huong. The plan, first initiated by UNAIDS last year, aims to make 90 per cent of all people living with HIV aware of their HIV status. In addition, it aims for 90 per cent of all people diagnosed with HIV to receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. Son La, which has nearly 8,000 people facing drug addiction and 7,722 people with HIV, according to the provincial police, was chosen to be one of five pilot localities to carry out the plan that is due to reach the three targets in 2017. The other four are also hot spots of HIV infection, including Dien Bien, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An and HCM City. Huong warned that the current employee shortage, worsened by the latest downsize, is likely to make the fight against HIV ""a mess"" in just three months. Van, as a voice from the grassroots level of the health system, said that with the current number of employees, ""it is simply impossible"". — VNS",Society,"['methadone', 'patients', 'fight', 'employees', 'hiv', 'employee', 'station', 'la', 'centre', 'staff', 'son', 'risk', 'work', 'poses', 'shortage', 'health']","A medical staffer gives methadone to an HIV-positive man in northern mountainous Son La Province's Moc Chau District.

HIV/AIDS can't stand in the way of love,Journalist Nguyen Thanh Ngan shocked her family and friends a year ago when she announced her impending marriage to a man with HIV.,[],2007-03-26,vietnamnews.vn,"Talk Around Town (25-03-2007) by Binh Minh Journalist Nguyen Thanh Ngan shocked her family and friends a year ago when she announced her impending marriage to a man with HIV. Ngan, a woman who works at the Gia Dinh va Xa Hoi (Family and Society) newspaper, said her decision to spend the rest of her life with painter Nguyen Trong Kien was simple. ""I married Kien because I love his beautiful soul. He is not only my partner, but also my friend and my teacher in art and life,"" said Ngan. The toughest part was finding out how to prevent the virus’s spread during intercourse and adapting to living with someone who will likely die of AIDS-related complications, she said. Her decision is not without its critics here in the city. In fact, many are sure HIV/AIDS automatically spells disaster in any relationship. ""I would never forgive my partner for getting the disease. HIV means you are promiscuous and don’t have safe sex. I would not accept a future husband like that,"" said Ngo Thuy Linh, a third-year student at Ha Noi’s University for Foreign Studies. Others believe the disease is just another challenge to overcome. ""I haven’t had a boyfriend yet, but if I knew my husband-to-be was HIV positive, I think I would stay beside him because he would need my support,"" said Mai Thu Trang, a young writer. ""I would not leave him because that would only cause more misery."" Trang said how her boyfriend contracted the disease would affect her decision. Nguyen Thi Hong Minh, director of the Central Reproduction Healthcare Centre, said she used to be suprised by the number of people wanting information about loving someone with HIV/AIDS. Many youth ask me how to get their partners tested for AIDS or whether they should marry someone who is HIV-postive, said Minh. The doctor once received a letter from a girl in HCM City who said she would do anything for her lover, even if it meant contracting the disease herself. She wrote: ""Because I love my partner deeply, I accept that I will eventually die of AIDS too."" The girl has a negative outlook, said Mai Thu Thuy, a sexual heath advisor. People should feel free to marry someone who is HIV positive, but no one should just ""accept death"", said Thuy. ""She should visit a doctor and learn the necessary tools to protect herself and her partner. Then she can decide what she wants to do,"" she said. For many couples dealing with HIV/AIDS, it’s the parents who object the most. ""I would never allow my daughter to marry a man with HIV. I would try to make her see how her life would be destroyed,"" said Nguyen Thi Nhung, a 54-year-old father. ""I nearly fainted when my daughter told me her boyfriend is HIV positive. I couldn’t discourage her, and now that they’re married, I feel sorry for her and for my family,"" said a mother who wished to remain anonymous. A woman from the capital’s Dong Da District told her story about living with her HIV positive husband on a sexual heath education website for teens under the guise of Nickname Chips. ""Hearing the bad news I was so shocked and angry, but then I found out how to keep myself from getting infected. Talking with health professionals helped me decide what to do. We’ve been married for nearly three years, and I’ve never regreted my choice,"" she wrote. But the woman was quick to add a warning of her own: ""Living with an HIV patient is not easy at all and you should think carefully before making any decision. Taking advice from parents and friends is something you should consider, but it’s your love and courage that must be taken into account."" It’s clear, despite medical advancements, there is a possibility couples can infect each other without meaning to. Giving birth to a healthy child, a goal of many in society, can also be a difficult prospect. No less daunting is the social stigma people who carry the virus are subject to everyday. If your love is strong enough, then the decision to stay by the side of a partner with HIV depends on your courage to face this new challenge. If you cannot accept this as part of your relationship, then perhaps you should support your loved one as a friend instead. But be sure to get as much information as possible to dispel myths or rumours about HIV/AIDS before you decide either way. ""AIDS can hinder love, there is no doubt of that. However, we want people who are going out with someone who is HIV positive to know AIDS does not mean you won’t live a long and happy life together,"" said Minh. — VNS",Talk Around Town,"['partner', 'love', 'stand', 'cant', 'woman', 'nguyen', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'way', 'life', 'decision', 'accept', 'positive']","""I haven’t had a boyfriend yet, but if I knew my husband-to-be was HIV positive, I think I would stay beside him because he would need my support,"" said Mai Thu Trang, a young writer.

The choice was made by the Global Fund, the Viet Nam National Co-ordinating Committee, the Ministry of Health and concerned organisations in a conference on HIV/AIDS prevention and control held in Ha Noi on Friday. The funds will be used to conduct a project on HIV/AIDS from 2015-17 in 15 provinces and cities across the country including Thai Nguyen, Ha Noi, Hai Duong, Nghe An, HCM City and Dong Nai. Dang Vu Minh, chairman of the VUSTA, said that the project would have three goals. The first goal is to supply HIV/AIDS prevention services to those at high risk of HIV. It is expected that by 2017, more than 26,000 homosexuals, nearly 45,000 heroin addicts and more than 10,000 sex workers will receive the services. The second goal is creating good conditions for the community to take part in HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities effectively and sustainably. The last goal is create good legal conditions for people at high risk of HIV to access health care services. Addressing the conference, Kristan Schoultz, Viet Nam Country Director of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), said that although Viet Nam had expanded its methadone treatment programme, the country did not reach the target of treating 80,000 heroin addicts with methadone by this year. Many heroin addicts needed safe needles because they could not access the methadone treatment programme, she said. The VUSTAs new project would help people at high risk of HIV access preventive tools which they needed, Schoultz said.

For this old woman crying had always helped her overcome the struggle of being a mother of two boys infected with HIV/AIDS. Linh, who lives in Ha Long City in north-eastern Quang Ninh Province, said hard times fell on her family when her husband, who had been exposed to Agent Orange, died in 1986. His passing left Linh alone with her three children, aged from 5 to 16 years of age. Linh said she had little time to look after her children because she had to earn money to feed them. ""As time went by my children got involved with some social evils, especially illegal drugs,"" said Linh. ""I didn’t know my two sons had become drug addicts until it was discovered that they had contracted AIDS. ""My family’s income declined when my first son grew more seriously ill, we didn’t have enough to make two meals per day. ""I tried to borrow some money from my friends to feed my son rice soup until he died. At that time he was 25 years old."" After Linh’s son died, she had to look after her son’s wife who had no job and their two children. Desperate for help, Linh was given a lifeline in the form of assistance from the city’s Empathy Club for the Elderly. Elderly express emotion in poetry Elderly carers of HIV/AIDS victims who wrote poems inspired by their ordeals received awards from the Viet Nam Women’s Union on Thursday. The awards were the result of a poetry competition, part of a project run by HelpAge International that attracted more than 2,000 elderly people from Quang Ninh, Ha Noi, Thai Nguyen and Nam Dinh. The contest aimed to spotlight the impacts of HIV/AIDS on the elderly and raise awareness on the elderly people’s role and contribution in caring for and supporting people living with HIV/AIDS. Nguyen Khac Toi from Thai Nguyen Province won the first prize with his poem Long Ba (The Heart of Grandmother). There were two second prizes, three third prizes and 13 encouragement prizes. A loan from the club has allowed Linh to start her own business. She opened a tea shop while her daughter-in-law earned some money cleaning bicycles and motorbikes. Linh said her family’s living standards had improved but her two grandchildren were suffering heart problems and serious diseases including arthrosis. The children are always ill when the weather changes. ""The loan is just a little but it is a great encouragement for my family,"" said Linh. Linh is one of many older people who have to take responsibility for family members living with HIV/AIDS in the country. According to a recent survey by the Viet Nam Women’s Union’s research arm, about 74.2 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS who responded to the survey were being taken care of by their parents or grandparents, 68 per cent of them were being cared for by their mothers and grandmothers. Findings from another survey conducted by the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly’s research arm among elderly people who had a HIV/AIDS victim in the family found that 82.6 per cent of these elderly people had to care for an average of between one to three family members. These old-aged carers have little support in the community, and desperately need help to soften the mental and physical sufferings for their own adult children and their orphaned grandchildren. Call for support Health workers in the field have called on more support and encouragement for elderly carers of AIDS victims through schemes such as HIV/AIDS prevention programmes. Pham Hoai Giang, an official at the Viet Nam’s Women Union, says the fierce fight against HIV/AIDS had affirmed the important role and great contribution of older people in caring for HIV-positive people and their children as well as in work on AIDS prevention. Giang said older people were taking part actively but silently in this fight and faced uncountable challenges and great responsibilities. ""How painful it is for them to have to witness their beloved children dying of AIDS and their grandchildren, because of AIDS, having to deal with stigma and discrimination from their relatives and the wider community,"" said Giang. ""We need to support and encourage them to participate further and more effectively in their work."" The Viet Nam Women’s Union carried out a project to minimise the impacts of HIV/AIDS in the country with support from overseas non-government organisation HelpAge International (HAI). Under the project, carried out from 2005 to 2009, 67 empathy clubs for the elderly with nearly 3,300 member have been established in Ha Noi, Thai Nguyen, Nam Dinh and Quang Ninh. The clubs have focused activities on loans to raise incomes, healthcare for the elderly and spreading useful information on HIV/AIDS in the community. The project also provided support for people with AIDS, children orphaned due to AIDS and people in high-risk groups. Nguyen Thi Hoa Binh, director of a centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Healthcare, said it is necessary to create conditions for the elderly to take part in communication activities on HIV/AIDS and Government and NGO programmes.",Society,"['project', 'care', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'family', 'aids', 'workers', 'help', 'quang', 'victims', 'support', 'children', 'elderly']","HIV/AIDS victims’ care workers call for help(13-08-2007)by Thu GiangThe mother of an HIV/AIDS victim speaks at a meeting of the Empathy Club for the Elderly in Cam Thach Ward of Cam Pha Town in Quang Ninh Province.

The two-day conference in Ha Noi, organised by the Health Ministry, focused on the Viet Nams implementation towards the United Nations new HIV treatment targets. Viet Nam set an ambitious treatment target to help end the AIDS epidemic, named 90-90-90 targets that by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. ""Since 1990, there have been 230,000 people infected with HIV and 85,000 have died of AIDS in Viet Nam. The country was aware of the threat of deadly epidemic,"" Deputy PM Dam said at the conference. ""With the effective help from international organisations, nations and the efforts of Vietnamese government offices, social organisations and the whole community including HIV-infected persons, Viet Nam has prevented and pushed back step-by-step this epidemic."" Viet Nam has implemented many models comprising the prevention and support of a variety of drugs to control the virus. Viet Nam has reported a reduction of the number of HIV-infected persons, people having HIV became AIDS, and died of AIDS for the last eight years. ""Todays conference is a practical activity of Viet Nam in response to the new HIV treatment targets and the national action month of HIV/AIDS prevention {November 10 to December 10],"" the Deputy PM said. Measures involved in prevention and treatment support needed the participation of scientists and the whole societys help. In Viet Nam, there are hundreds of scientific studies and proposals related to people living with HIV and treatment every year. However, the deputy PM said, to take advantage of the effectiveness of scientific studies, the government had to promulgate policies to support the implementation of these studies. The whole society also had to share in the responsibility to speed up the implementation. The conference attracted 1,000 international and Vietnamese participants with 180 reports expected to be presented. Francoise Barre Sinoussi, a French virologist and director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Division in Paris, France, attended the event.

The remaining new cases reported so far this year were contracted through sex workers or other means.

HIV patient’s heart surgery successfully conducted,Doctors from the Việt Nam-Germany Hospital have successfully conducted an eight-hour heart surgery on a female patient with the HIV virus.,[],2017-05-19,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — Doctors from the Việt Nam-Germany Hospital have successfully conducted an eight-hour heart surgery on a female patient with the HIV virus. Associate Professor Nguyễn Hữu Ước, head of the hospital’s Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Department, said the 42-year-old patient was hospitalised on May 4. The woman was infected with the HIV virus in 2005 and began using antiretroviral drugs in 2015, he added. Doctors also diagnosed that she suffered from type-A aortic aneurysm, aortic insufficiency, mitral incompetence and Marfan syndrome. Ước said Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue, with 0.5 per cent of the population suffering from this disease. Patients with Marfan syndrome showed pathological symptoms related to the eyes and the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems. Cardiovascular damage is generally associated with aortic aneurysms and mitral incompetence, he said. Type-A aortic aneurysm is serious life-threatening disease, with 3-4 patients per 100,000 people contracting the disease every year, he said. If not provided proper treatment, only some 10 per cent of patients with the disease can live more than one year, he said. The surgery was conducted on May 9 by Ước and Phùng Duy Hồng Sơn from the Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Department and eight other doctors. The heart surgery was believed to be complicated because the patient’s immune system was depleted due to the HIV infection, he said.

Việt Nam focuses on early HIV detection,"Dr Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control, speaks to Vietnam News Agency about the country’s efforts to increase early HIV screening tests, as an estimated 20 per cent of HIV sufferers do not know they are infected.",[],2017-12-07,vietnamnews.vn,"Dr Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Việt Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control, speaks to Vietnam News Agency about the country’s efforts to increase early HIV screening tests, as an estimated 20 per cent of HIV sufferers do not know they are infected. Can you update our readers on the HIV/AIDS situation in Việt Nam in 2017? In the first nine months of 2017, more than 6,880 people tested positive for HIV, of which over 3,480 have turned AIDS. We recorded 1,260 deaths of people with HIV. It is estimated by late this year, the number of new cases of people living with HIV will be about 9,800 while the number of deaths will climb to some 1, 900. According to the latest report on people living with HIV in 2017, 22 per cent of patients are women, while 78 per cent are men. The transmission route for 58 per cent of patients is sexual activity. Blood transfusions account for 32 per cent and mother-to-child transmission for 2.6 per cent. The route for 8 per cent of patients is undetermined. Regarding the age group distribution, some 40 per cent of the HIV positive people detected in 2017 are between 30-39, 30 per cent are in the age group of 20-29, 19 per cent in the age group of 40-49, 6 per cent are over 50, 3 per cent are from 14 to 19 and 2 per cent are children under 13 years old. The demographic characteristics of people living with HIV/AIDS in 2017 is almost the same as in 2016. In the first nine months of 2017, the number of new HIV cases fell 1.1 per cent compared to the same period in 2016. Meanwhile the number of new AIDS patients was also reduced by 39 per cent and the fatality rate among people with HIV/AIDS dropped by 10 per cent. In some provinces, over 10 per cent of pregnant women were HIV positive. This is due to the lack of early HIV/AIDS detection services for people, especially women who might become pregnant. Another point I want to mention here is the increasing transmission of HIV through unsafe sex, particularly among young people. Will you please further explain the significance of early HIV testing? As we all know the HIV virus can exist in the human body with few or no symptoms for 12 to 13 years, so people with HIV still live a normal life. Their HIV status is only revealed if they have a blood test. In our country up to 20 per cent of people living with HIV do not know that they are HIV positive as they don’t go to health clinics for blood tests. If they know that they are HIV positive, they can take preventive measures to protect their sex partners, family members and other people. At present, we do not have any drug that can cure HIV, but anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs are available to help people with HIV prolong their healthy life while reducing the possibility of transmission to other people. People living with HIV should take ARV as described by their doctors. The latest scientific research has confirmed that if an HIV patient takes ARVs regularly, the chance of HIV transmission to their sex partner will drop by 96 per cent. Early detection of their HIV status will help the infected people enjoy good treatment and take action to reduce the risk of secondary infection. As a result, they can save quite a lot of money they’d have to spend on drugs, check-ups and hospital visits. Will you please further explain Việt Nam’s targets of 90-90-90 by 2020? The targets 90-90-90, set in 2014, mean that by 2020 90 per cent of HIV infected people will know their infection status, 90 per cent of HIV positive people will receive ARV drugs and 90 per cent of people taking ARV drugs will have a low HIV load. According to a September 2017 report, there are 208,371 people who know they are living with HIV/AIDS in Việt Nam. This figure represents about 75 per cent of the estimated total figure of people living with HIV in the community. So we will have to do quite a lot of work to achieve the target that 90 per cent of HIV infected people know their infection status. Currently, we have 1,345 health clinics providing services of counseling and testing for HIV positive people. 128 HIV labs in 63 provinces and cities are authorised to confirm HIV status for their clients, plus 1,250 laboratories are able to screen HIV tests in all district hospitals nation-wide. In addition, the Ministry of Health has scaled up community-based HIV testing services, focusing on 15 cities and provinces with large numbers of HIV infections; and piloted HIV self-testing in which people can perform a test on a sample of their saliva at community-based institutions. We hope through such activities we’ll be able to detect more people with HIV and give them proper treatment. — VNS",Opinion,"['detection', 'early', 'việt', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', '2017', 'status', 'transmission', 'cent', 'focuses', 'know', 'positive']","Their HIV status is only revealed if they have a blood test.

The seminar, hosted by the AIDS Committee of HCM City, aimed to expand the Orphan and Vulnerable Children (OVC) programme, which has been running in HCM City since 2005. The OVC programme cares for HIV-infected orphans, who range from babies to teenagers. It provides children with health care, food, education, emotional counseling, shelter and legal support. The city has 70,000 orphaned children, of which 2,500 carry HIV. About six hundred children are born to HIV-infected mothers every year, according to the AIDS Committee.

Giang added that while the city has helped to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on children, co-operation between government agencies and NGOs should be improved. Currently, the city has only 11 centres applying the OVC programme, treating 4,212 orphans. The programme has received support from international and local organisations.

VN push to achieve UN’s AIDS targets,The head of the HCM City AIDS Prevention Centre has asked the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS to help the country reach the 90-90-90 targets set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS to help end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.,[],2016-10-12,vietnamnews.vn,"The head of the HCM City AIDS Prevention Centre has asked the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS to help the country reach the 90-90-90 targets set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS to help end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. — Photo laodong.com.vn HCM CITY — The head of the HCM City AIDS Prevention Centre has asked the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS to help the country reach the 90-90-90 targets set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS to help end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. Speaking at a forum on MSM (men who have sex with men) and transgendered people about the UN targets on Monday, Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, said that Việt Nam was one of the first 30 countries to try to achieve the targets by 2020. The 90-90-90 goals ensure that at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV will know their status, and that 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. In addition, 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy will be diagnosed with viral suppression. HCM City was chosen as one of 32 cities worldwide to reach the targets by 2020, Vân said. In the context of decreased international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention in the country, including in HCM City, the city is setting up a new treatment and management system to maintain positive results in prevention and achieve the targets. The committee estimates that, according to the targets, the city will have 14,038 more people with HIV that need treatment by 2020. Currently, the city’s hospitals and district’s preventive health centres are treating 27,500 people with HIV, she said. Last year, the city had an estimated 41,841 people with HIV. In the past, when international aid was provided, any patient with HIV who lived in the city, even those without an official residential book, was eligible to receive antiretroviral therapy. However, the provision of therapy would no longer be the same when international aid was cut completely, Vân said, adding that it must be provided through health insurance. Vân said the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS(VNP+) could help patients with HIV in the network better understand the issue. The network’s members can speak with health officials and encourage more people at a high risk of HIV to access testing services. The network can also help its patients with HIV maintain treatment, as some of them give up treatment when they encounter obstacles. Nguyễn Anh Phong, a representative of Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in HCM City, said the network’s members would identify more patients with HIV and help them access ARV The network only focused on prevention previously, Phong said. A woman named Jessica, head of the JF Band, the name of a group which provides assistance to transgender people, said that she helps her members protect themselves from HIV infection. A recent study showed that the city has around 30,000 MSM and transgender people, accounting for one per cent to three per cent of its male population. They are at a high risk for HIV infection. It is estimated that the rate of HIV infection among MSM is nearly 16 per cent and 18 per cent for transgender people. —VNS",Society,"['targets', 'city', 'uns', 'vn', 'push', 'hiv', 'việt', 'nam', 'cent', 'aids', 'prevention', 'help', 'achieve', 'network']","The head of the HCM City AIDS Prevention Centre has asked the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS to help the country reach the 90-90-90 targets set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS to help end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.

HIV project targets at-risk population,A project that seeks to control the spread of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam by linking people most at risk with needed services was launched in Ha Noi yesterday.,[],2015-01-28,vietnamnews.vn,"A medical worker counsels a former drug addict undergoing methadone treatment on HIV/AIDS prevention in Le Chan District, Hai Phong City. — VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc HA NOI (VNS) — A project that seeks to control the spread of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam by linking people most at risk with needed services was launched in Ha Noi yesterday. The ""USAID Community HIV Link - Northern Coast"" project will be carried out in the provinces of Nghe An and Quang Ninh as well as the port city of Hai Phong. The main implementer of the three-year project that closes in July 2017 will be the Centre for Community Health and Development (COHED). A press-release from the project sponsor, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), says that ""to contain current prevention and treatment activities, local civil society organisations (CSOs) and community-based organisations (CBOs) must increase their contributions to the national HIV programme."" As such, it will mobilise and train a network of CBSs to reach out to at-risk populations and facilitate the latters access to services like HIV testing and ARV treatment. The project identifies key populations into four categories: those who have not been HIV tested for the last six months or do not report their HIV status; those who inject drugs and have not had a HIV test during the last six months; those who have never enrolled in an out-patient clinic for ARV treatment or enrolled but dropped out or not properly followed the treatment protocol; and primary sexual partners of the first two categories. To build the capacity of CSOs and CBOs, the project will conduct capacity assessments, provide training and mentoring, and advocate provinces to involve the organisations in the process of formulating and issuing relevant policies for the localities. The project will also support CSOs and CBOs in joining the existing national network by participating in events, meetings and other activities. Dao Thi Mai Hoa, director of COHED, said that the project aims to help CBOs and CSOs reach about 6,700 at-risk people and refer over 6,000 to HIV Testing and Counseling. It aims to find over 600 new HIV cases and provide care and support services to more than 900 people living with HIV outside of the health facility. It also targets ""strengthening the capacity of at least 30 old and new CSOs and CBOs in the three project localities"". Dao said that the project would also help people living with HIV/AIDS by providing services in their own living environments.

The hotline was set up by Ha Noi-based Ha Thanh Development Company in co-ordination with the Ha Noi Television and Broadcasting Station. The service aims to provide callers with preventive information and offer advice to high-risk groups such as prostitutes and drug addicts. Providing up to date information, the latest statistics, government instructions relating to disease prevention, reasons for infection, symptoms, preventive measures, treatment centres, question-and-answer advice on HIV/AIDS and technical assistance, the service aims to be a one-stop shop for assisting those in need. Representatives from the hotline stressed that it was not just a service for those at high risk of infection such as drug addicts, but is also for the average person. Calls range from men who may have drunk too much and had sex without a contraceptive to a woman who stepped on a discarded syringe in Ngo Si Lien St while out for a morning walk Stories like these are common and it is the job of the hotline workers to provide immediate and informative answers to such calls. Nguyen Huy Thang is one such worker on the 10-member technical team from Ha Thanh Ltd.Co. ""The spread of HIV/AIDS is occurring so rapidly that it is not only high-risk groups who should be concerned,"" exclaimed Thang. ""We are advisors. Our job is to provide all types of information on HIV/AIDS for the callers."" World Bank grant for prevention HA NOI — Yesterday the World Bank approved a grant of US$35 million to support the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project for Viet Nam which aims to curb the transmission of HIV/AIDS. The number of Vietnamese people infected with HIV/AIDS is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The Ministry of Health estimated that 245,000 people were living with HIV by the end of 2003. However infection among high risk groups, mainly intravenous drug users and sex workers, is increasing. In response, the Government has prioritised prevention programmes targeting high risk groups, and aims to keep the disease below 0.3 per cent of the population. Director of the World Bank in Viet Nam Klaus Roland said the strategy also aims to increase awareness and change the attitude of the general populace and policy makers. ""Discrimination is hindering strategies to halt the transmission of HIV and we will support the Government’s efforts create behavioural changes through education to reduce the stigma of the disease,"" he said. The grant supports the development of models to help reduce transmission of HIV/AIDS and will also support the government’s efforts to develop a system to monitor the effectiveness of its prevention programme. More than 60 per cent of the World Bank grant will be used to support the design and implementation of specific provincial action plans among 18 provinces. — VNS ""We obtain this information from various sources including newspapers, health centres and experienced doctors from central hospitals in Ha Noi."" The hotline is currently working with two Ha Noi-based health centres, the Research Centre for Community Health and Development, and the Voluntary Advisory Centre. Information, facts and figures are also updated each week to ensure that callers are provided with the latest material and advice on HIV/AIDS. As of March 29, the hotline had received a total of 3,141 calls, of which 1,736 came from Ha Noi. On average, the service receives close to 50 calls per day. ""Most of the calls are about symptoms, infection, preventative methods, antiretroviral and other concerns of HIV-affected people,"" Thang said. The hotline is very optimistic about the potential of the project, mainly because of the privacy offered to callers and the timely advice provided. ""This is a psychological issue,"" said Thang. ""One of the characteristics of the Eastern people is that they seem to keep the disease secret."" After operating for one month, the project organisers expect the use of the hotline to increase. They also expect enquiries from HCM City to grow from the current 176 callers. With over 10-years of experience in HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, Doctor Nguyen Van Thanh, from the Ha Noi-based Research Centre for Community Health and Development, felt that the hotline had a great deal of potential. ""Thanks to the current trend in high-tech information technology, this is a creative project that is serving social development,"" said Thanh. The project was among 51 different activities that eventuated from Innovation Day, a conference held to promote the fight against HIV/AIDS across the country. The event, organised by the World Bank in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, was held in Ha Noi in May of last year.

Oral HIV pre-exposure service launched,The Việt Nam Administration for AIDS Control in coordination with PATH has launched an oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service in Việt Nam.,[],2017-06-14,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY— The Việt Nam Administration for AIDS Control in coordination with PATH has launched an oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service in Việt Nam. Under the PrEP service which was launched on Monday, people who are at substantial risk of contracting HIV take an antiretroviral drug which contains tenofovir every day as part of a combination HIV-prevention strategy. When people are exposed to HIV through sex or recreational drug injections, the oral HIV PrEP may work to keep them from becoming infected. PrEP taken on a consistent basis has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92 per cent. Since 2015, the World Health Organisation has strongly recommended PrEP as part of a combination HIV-prevention strategy for people at substantial risk of contracting HIV. “PrEP is a new and evidenced-based method for HIV prevention that is increasingly being adopted around the world, including in lower- and middle-income countries,” said Dr. Nguyễn Hoàng Long, director of Việt Nam Administration for AIDS Control. “By introducing PrEP services in Việt Nam, we have the opportunity to dramatically reduce the number of new HIV cases and eliminate HIV in Việt Nam by 2030,” Long said. “Once again, we see Việt Nam leading the region in HIV innovations and making key HIV services available to those who need them the most,” Mary Tarnowka, US Consul General, said. “We greatly value our longstanding Việt Nam-US partnership and are working together to propel Việt Nam towards the 90-90-90 (90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression) goals by 2020,” she said. The introduction of PrEP services is part of the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the Healthy Markets project, a five-year initiative funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “The integration of PrEP into HIV services in Việt Nam will provide a huge boost to reduce new HIV cases among those most at risk,” said Dr. Kimberly Green, chief of party for Healthy Markets. “The aim of this PrEP pilot is to model how services can best be targeted and offered in a sustainable way. Results will be used to inform national guidelines and future PrEP financing,” she said. PrEP prescriptions began in March. The pilot programme will run until September 2018 at which time the results will be documented and presented to the Ministry of Health for the following steps. —VNS",Society,"['prep', 'preexposure', 'services', 'việt', 'nam', 'oral', 'hiv', 'service', 'cent', 'antiretroviral', 'aids', 'risk', 'reduce', 'launched']","HCM CITY— The Việt Nam Administration for AIDS Control in coordination with PATH has launched an oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service in Việt Nam.

It is expected to provide loans to 100 women in order to do small business, open sewing shops, and raise cattle. HA NOI — Women at high risk of HIV/AIDS have not received adequate education to protect themselves from the virus, a conference on the subject heard yesterday. Senior capacity development manager Amy Sunseri of Pact, a non-governmental organisation in Viet Nam, said the number of women living with HIV/AIDS was getting closer to that of men while women had less knowledge of the disease than men. The Ministry of Healths Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control estimated there would be about 77,000 women in the country living with HIV/AIDS by 2012, an increase of 5 per cent compared to 2002. But in a ministry survey of 10,000 people aged 14-25 in 2009, only 63 per cent of women knew clearly about the virus and had the necessary skills to protect themselves, while the percentage of men was 69. The number among women living in rural areas was about 50 per cent. Leader of a 1000-member support group in Ha Noi Trinh Thuy Ngan said most got the virus from their husband and took little care of the disease before joining the group. ""They neglected to protect themselves from transmission, thinking it was the others duty. Most lack deep understanding or skills on how to take care of themselves, how to get proper treatment and how to bring up their kids safely,"" Ngan said. UNAIDS Partnership adviser Chris Fontaine said an assessment of 24 HIV/AIDS programmes implemented by international and local NGOs showed that most focused on groups of injecting drug users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men and migrant workers. Women whose husbands had unsafe sex with prostitutes or were injecting drug users had yet to receive much attention, Fontaine said. Programmes and policies should focus more on intimate partner transmission and HIV/AIDS counsellors and reproductive health workers should be given training about the issues, Fontaine said.

Online outreach scheme effective for men with HIV,"The use of the internet as a tool for early detection of HIV cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) has proven to be effective, particularly in light of budget cuts for HIV/AIDS prevention in HCM City.",[],2013-10-02,vietnamnews.vn,"The AIDS Committee of HCM City said the model was effective between July 2012 and June 2013. Roughly 5,500 MSM were accessed through the internet and more than 6,000 MSM were reached with traditional methods.— File Photo by Van Dat HCM CITY (VNS)— The use of the internet as a tool for early detection of HIV cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) has proven to be effective, particularly in light of budget cuts for HIV/AIDS prevention in HCM City. Satisfactory results were announced yesterday during a meeting to evaluate the projects with officials from the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one year after the programme was piloted with eight peer educators knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and internet use. According to Nguyen Thi Hue, head of the Harm Reduction Department under the HCM City AIDS Committee, the project will be expanded to other provinces and cities. The city, which has widespread internet use, has more than 24,000 MSM aged between 15 and 49. Recent surveys show that using internet use to seek partners has become popular among the citys youth. The AIDS Committee of HCM City said the model was effective between July 2012 and June 2013. Roughly 5,500 MSM were accessed through the internet and more than 6,000 MSM were reached with traditional methods. However, in order to achieve good results, the committee needs 58 peer educators for traditional methods, while it needs only eight people for online access. The budget for traditional outreach last year was reported at more than VND3.2 billion while the budget for internet access was VND215 million. Le Son, group leader of MSMs online in HCM City, who has experienced as a group leader, said outreach through the internet had been a new experience for him. In the past, he would go online and chat with friends but he did not think of using internet to access clients. During the year of the pilot programme, Son said that he and his group faced many challenges but they were able to chat with five clients at the same time on the internet. Apart from computers, they also used smartphones to access people considered to be part of the highest at-risk population. The city had 450 peer educators for at-risk members of the MSM community, but the number has fallen to 100. In the future, there will be only MSM 70 peer educators who will receive salaries from the State budget, Hue said, adding that the number of online peer educators will be maintained at eight, Hue told Viet Nam News. Marta Ackers, associate director of the USs PEPFAR programme office in HCM City, said the project had been promising in HCM City, and neighbouring countries were also using this method. Community outreach is one of the most important elements of HIV prevention strategies targeting the people most at risk. Ackers recalled the situation in 1993 when HIV began to spread. HCM City implemented a harm-reduction programme, by piloting a needle-syringe programme for injection-drug users (IDUs) and condom use programme for and female sex workers (FSWs) through peer-outreach workers. The peer outreach worker network now is used in all of HCM Citys districts to serve the highest at-risk population, including IDUs and FSWs, by delivering free needle syringes and condoms. Now, while transmission is targeted on the MSM community, HIV prevention methods should be changed. Currently, only 3 per cent of the 20,000 to 25,000 most at-risk population of MSMs in HCM City have been reached via traditional outreach. HIV prevalence among MSMs in the city increased from 5.4 per cent in 2006 to 15 per cent in 2009, she said, adding that the project aimed to increase outreach and coverage of HIV service utility among MSMs. In a few years, the model will be expanded to other provinces and cities. The peer educators said they would do the job even without pay. Each MSM online peer educator receives VND500,000 each month. According to a social worker who works at the Mekong Deltas An Giang Provinces AIDS Prevention Centre, the province has only six MSM peer educators who can meet with their clients for consultations. According to the official, the rate of internet usage in the province is high and can be accessed in rural areas as well. The problem now is finding peer educators who are knowledgeable about HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. ""Discrimination is still high in the province, so not many gay people are ready to come out and become peer educators. It is more challenging there to seek online peer educators,"" he added. — VNS",Society,"['men', 'peer', 'msm', 'hcm', 'city', 'outreach', 'scheme', 'hiv', 'educators', 'online', 'internet', 'effective', 'programme', 'traditional']","The AIDS Committee of HCM City said the model was effective between July 2012 and June 2013.

The doctors decided to remove her womb, which had necrotised or had suffered cell death, to save her.

HIV-AIDS patients to be covered by health insurance,"Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the newspaper Kinh tế&Đô thị (Economics and Urban Affairs) about the scheme to expand health insurance to cover HIV-AIDS patients.",[],2017-08-09,vietnamnews.vn,"Hoàng Đình Cảnh Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the newspaper Kinh tế&Đô thị (Economics and Urban Affairs) about the scheme to expand health insurance to cover HIV-AIDS patients. Last year, Việt Nam set a goal to have all HIV carriers join the health care network. Do you know their current rate of coverage? Just about 50 per cent of HIV people have joined the national health insurance scheme. One of the reasons that many don’t join is fear of being discriminated against or having a stigma against them. Some other HIV-infected people don’t join because they don’t have money to pay for their health insurance cards. Last but not least, many AIDS patients don’t have the personal documents required for joining the health insurance scheme. As far as I know, many provincial committees have balanced their local budgets in order to provide this group with free health insurance cards. The Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control has decided to use funding from international organisations to buy health insurance cards for poor and needy HIV-AIDS patients. Are there any hurdles that HIV-AIDS centres have encountered in seeking coverage by the National Health Insurance Fund? By the end of May, some 79.6 percent of HIV treatment facilities affiliated with hospitals or healthcare centres had signed service agreements with the health insurance companies, and 44.4 percent of the health facilities nationwide had offered their services to HIV carriers with health insurance cards. In my opinion, the most challenging issue many health facilities are facing in HIV-AIDS treatment is that many of their staff do not have the required certificates. In addition, these health facilities are required to have permits to treat this group of people as a pre-requisite for financial settlement with the health insurance companies. The Ministry of Health will reportedly launch a pilot program using Buprenophine to replace Methadone to treat drug addicted HIV carriers. What are the differences between Buprenophine and Methadone? Buprenophine is safer than Methadone. That’s the key reason the WHO has recommended Việt Nam switch. However, Buprenonphine is more expensive. That’s why the Ministry of Health has introduced the use of Buprenophine for patients with sufficient financial resources. I want to further clarify that the Suboxone substance contained in Buprenophine has been piloted in Hà Nội and Hồ Chí Minh City and has yielded better results. So we plan to give Buprenophine to about 500 patients in the provinces of Điện Biên, Nghệ An and Sơn La in the remaining months of 2017 and by 2018 we will give the drug to another 2,000 patients in the previous three provinces, plus four more provinces _ Thanh Hóa, Hòa Bình, Yên Bái and Lai Châu._VNS",Society,"['required', 'covered', 'provinces', 'patients', 'dont', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'facilities', 'buprenophine', 'health', 'insurance']","Hoàng Đình CảnhHoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy director of the Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the newspaper Kinh tế&Đô thị (Economics and Urban Affairs) about the scheme to expand health insurance to cover HIV-AIDS patients.

The seminar was organised to help the Party Central Committee issue a new instruction on HIV/AIDS prevention in the future, and aimed to find out the best ways of reducing stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam.

""It is why when developing a policy for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the country we pay attention to creating a legal basis appropriate to international practices and to values of our traditional culture to fight against stigma and discrimination,"" said A. A said many articles of the HIV/AIDS Ordinance passed by the NA’s Standing Committee in 1995 shows the rights and interests of PLWHA. For example, Article 4 affirms that PLWHA should enjoy non-stigma and non-discrimination but have to take measures to prevent the transmission of the disease in order to protect the community’s health, while Article 18 prohibits the release of the name, age, address and image of a PLWHA to the public, except if an agreement is made by the person. Although the country’s policies and legislation regarding the fight against stigma and discrimination are rather comprehensive, they lack many important items such as issues relating to children and the rights of children infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. A said there is a lack of identification of social and individual responsibilities of those who are HIV positive as part of the programme to prevent the spread of HIV and their responsibilities within the community to remove the stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS.

Huyen was so sad, she no longer wanted to go to school. Unfortunately, she is not alone in her suffering.

For over 13 years, she has helped wash and care for patients – even during their final moments – even when many other people, including their family members, are afraid of being infected. — VNS Photo The Van by Bich Huong HA NOI (VNS) — At Nhat Tan Market in Tay Ho District, 57-year-old Bui Thi Dong is known as ""Dong AIDS"" or ""Dong Drugs"". Its not because this lady has the disease or uses drugs, its because for more than 13 years, she has been the last line of support for HIV/AIDS patients. Since 2000, Dong has helped countless AIDS patients, some in the final stages of the disease. She encourages families not to abandon them and to stay with them until the end. She has no money for her volunteer work, but is so well-known that even families of AIDS patients from near-by districts come to her for help. Dongs kindness has spread beyond her district and made her something of a local celebrity, but she doesnt really like all the attention. ""I do it as a good deed. I saw that many people were scared of helping sufferers because they were afraid they would become infected too, or simply didnt know how to assist them,"" she said. For 20 years, she has been spending more time at the market than at her house since her first son died at the age of 25 and daughter-in-law died aged 22, both from HIV/AIDS, about ten years ago. Her second son – a drug addict – has spent years in rehab. One day, one of the other market traders came to Dongs tea stand and asked her: ""Do you have no work today, Mrs AIDS?"" ""The fact she is here now means that no one in the village is going to die of AIDS today,"" explained a fruit-seller next to Dongs stall. ""Whenever she gets a phone call or people come to talk about something related to HIV/AIDS, she leaves the stall without warning."" Nhat Tan Village became a second home for Dong 40 years ago after she left her hometown in the northern province of Thai Binh to work as a brick layer for a construction company in Ha Noi. In those 40 years, Dong has spent 30 preparing dead bodies for their final rituals as her way of enforcing a belief in a spiritual life after death. ""Villagers ask me to help them enshroud the dead bodies because they believe that if the ritual is performed correctly and with care, then the dead can pass away in peace and avoid bad luck,"" she said. However, in her worse nightmares, Dong never thought that she would be the only one to perform this last task for AIDS victims after her children died. She was devastated by their deaths and the way her fellow villagers discriminated against AIDS patients. ""When I was informed that my first son was a drug addict and had become infected with HIV/AIDS in 1990, I had no idea about the disease except that it was an infectious fatal disease and a social evil,"" she said. But as a mother, Dong did everything possible to save her son, including selling her own blood and taking out high-interest loans to pay for his medical expenses. ""After suffering for ten years, my 25-year-old son still dreamed of getting married and having a small family of his own, and he wanted to marry another villager who was also living with HIV at that time,"" she said. Regardless of the dangerous virus, she accepted the marriage because they were human beings with the right to live happily. More burdens were placed on her shoulders, but she said she has no regrets. ""Sometimes, I was scared that I could become infected, but I was reassured by regular blood tests in the city,"" she said. ""As a mother, I was the last person my children could rely on."" After that, other villagers whose loved-ones were dying from AIDS also started coming to Dong for help. In 2000, her first case was a 22-year-old male drug addict who had been receiving medical treatment in Tan Ky District, central Nghe An Province. For his last wish, his family returned him to the village. For two days, the family wore gloves and were afraid of being infected. They did not know how to care for him. Dong said she bought him food and helped him to wash. ""I knew he would not give me an infection,"" she remembered. ""He thanked me before passing away."" Dong set up a voluntary group to assist people living with HIV/AIDS in Nhat Tan Ward in 2011. Bui Van De, one of the group members and head of the wards Red-Cross Society, said that the 40 members - including people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and representatives of local social organizations - have been working to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS prevention, how HIV/AIDS carriers can take care of themselves and how family members can help. ""Dongs kindness cannot be found elsewhere,"" he said. ""She does this to ease the discrimination and suffering that the patients have to bear."" In 2005, Dong started going on various training activities run by international organisations on HIV/AIDS prevention and control. But for local villagers, no training or expertise can replace her, because she does her work out of love. ""I think of the patients as my children,"" Dong said. ""My reward is receiving their gratitude before they die."" — VNS",Society,"['devotes', 'tea', 'patients', 'tan', 'hivaids', 'dong', 'son', 'aids', 'life', 'infected', 'members', 'work', 'seller', 'family']","Bui Thi Dong, 57, of Ha Noi's Nhat Tan Ward, prepares to reach families of HIV/ AIDS patients on her old bike.

Buddhism shines light into HIV/AIDS darkness,"The pagoda can't offer material needs to anyone, but it offers inspiring words of encouragement, empathy and has a strong wish to share the difficulties of people living with HIV/AIDS.",[],2014-05-04,vietnamnews.vn,"Inspiring compassion: Monk Thich Thanh Huan (third left) shares his knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection with devotees visiting his pagoda. — Photo Phap Van Pagoda files by Hong Thuy When I arrived, Nguyen Van Kien (name changed) was lying on a bare, rickety bed made of thin wooden planks. It was a cool March morning. There were five similar beds arranged in a narrow, basement room of the Phap Van Pagoda in Ha Nois Thanh Tri District. The room was dimly lit, with half-open windows. I could hardly see anyone inside; just silhouettes on the beds divided by makeshift curtains. Only when Kien moved to the empty bed, which was at an arms length from me, did I see his face. Clad in a blue jeans and T-shirt, Kien looked rather healthy for someone who had been diagnosed with the dreaded Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). ""No one thought that I was alive, including the doctors at the Bach Mai Hospital,"" the 35 year-old-man recalled. ""My family and monk Thich Thanh Huan saved my life and made me feel that I was not abandoned,"" he said. Kien was in anguish and desperate when he first contracted the HIV virus in 2006. He attempted to commit suicide on numerous occasions by injecting himself with lethal drug overdoses and not caring about living a healthy life to slow the progress of full-blown AIDS. Yet, good quality of care, empathy, and encouragement from his family and the monk helped Kien lead a balanced and longer life. ""I realise that overthinking and depression can make me more vulnerable to the illness, so I prefer to be in the company of people facing a similar dilemma like me. In the pagoda I can meet and talk to my peers,"" he said. Earlier, Kien had no place to go except the Ha Noi Lung Hospital, which he frequented for receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). He started visiting the pagoda four years ago after Monk Thich Thanh Huans visit to his house. The monk had dropped in to inquire about his health, and invited him to participate in clubs for people living with HIV/AIDS. Kien confessed to have been visibly moved by the good intentions of the monk who showed genuine interest in his well-being and was keen to help him overcome difficulties, though they had never met before. Sharing similar feelings, Hoang Phuong Lam (not her real name) claimed that she would have died had she not met the monk who offered her shelter and informed her about the use of ART for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. ""Mental factors can lead to life or death situations among people living with HIV/AIDS. The discrimination of the people in my homeland makes me feel like a fish out water. Even now, I do not dare to return home to visit my loved ones,"" Lam remarked. Having married in 2003, Lam knew she had contracted the HIV virus from her life partner, a drug user, a year later. Since then, no one wants to come to her tailoring shop to have their suits made. Many people did not even return to collect their finished garments after they heard about the fatal virus that Lam carried. ""People did not want to sit next to me for fear of being infected with the virus. Even my nephews mother told him that he should not take any food that I gave him,"" Lam, 36, recalled. Loneliness and isolation had jeopardised her health, though it was only three years since she contracted the virus. When Lam met the monk in 2007, she had already developed AIDS as a result of her HIV infection. Counselling centre Sitting cross-legged in a lotus posture with one lap of his brown robe covered on it, monk Thich Thanh Huan was the epitome of warmth and kindness as he greeted me with a genuine smile. ""When people living with HIV/AIDS come to the pagoda to seek help, I understand that they feel alone, isolated, and frightened at times. Thus, they look forward to having peace in their life. They are in dire need of help. This motivated me to set up a counselling and care centre for people living with HIV/AIDS,"" said the monk. Founded in 2003, the centre has attracted several thousand people who have benefited from spiritual counselling, information and food. Many have been given assistance in the form of free screening and treatment for HIV infection. They have also been provided shelter when they were in a state of shock, and have been advised on how to live a healthy lifestyle. ""The pagoda cant offer material needs to anyone, but it offers inspiring words of encouragement, empathy and has a strong wish to share the difficulties of people living with HIV/AIDS,"" explained monk Thich Thanh Huan. In keeping with the spirit of life engagement and pursuit of happiness among humans, which is the essence of Vietnamese Buddhism, the monk stated that he wants to give hope and faith to the victims of HIV/AIDS. He has helped set up clubs for HIV-infected people to interact and share information about HIV/AIDS prevention and protection. The monk considers every pagoda-goer equal. Not surprisingly, the Phap Van pagoda has become a place of refuge for several people living with HIV/AIDS. Fighting stigma In 63 cities and provinces across the country, pagodas have been offering counselling to HIV/AIDS victims and partaking in movements to stem out the associated stigma and discrimination, according to Standing Vice President of Buddhist Sangha of Viet Nam (BSV)s Executive Council, Most Venerable Thich Thanh Nhieu. It is no wonder that their contributions play a vital role in helping Viet Nam control the outbreak of the HIV epidemic. According to the Millennium Development Goals report released last year by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Viet Nam has successfully managed to reduce the number of new cases of HIV infection as well as HIV-related deaths in the recent years. Over a 11-month-period in 2012, the number of reported HIV cases dropped by 22 per cent and the number of deaths decreased nearly threefold. Overall, Viet Nam has successfully contained HIV prevalence to under 0.3 per cent, which is lower than the target set by the now superseded national 2004-2010 strategy. The report revealed that there were 208,866 HIV-positive cases, 59,839 AIDS patients, and 62,184 AIDS-related deaths in Viet Nam in 2012. In spite of these achievements, challenges prevail, the report added. There is a high risk of an outbreak within some communities like HCM City and Ha Noi; poor coverage of HIV screening programmes in remote and economically disadvantaged areas; limited patient access to needles, syringes, and condoms; insufficient provision of ART to people living with HIV/AIDS; and funding constraints. Confronting such challenges, Monk Thich Thanh Huan noted that Vietnamese Buddhism entering social life (life engagement) is a major concern among Vietnamese monks and nuns, who take responsibility to bring happiness to people and peace to the society. ""We do not have money to offer, but we are able to improve peoples lives through implementing the Buddhist spirit of mercy, fraternity, and salvation,"" the monk explained. Vesak goals Life engagement is also a linchpin to be highlighted at the imminent Vesak Day, which falls on May 7, an officially recognized United Nations holiday that celebrates the birth of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. Under the theme ""Buddhist Perspective towards Achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals"", the event will mark a milestone for Vietnamese Buddhism to showcase to the world that it will work in tandem with other countries to solve global issues, though being simultaneously involved in charity work to bring happiness to the lives of the people, which has been followed ever since Buddhism was introduced in Viet Nam more than 2,000 years ago. ""Buddhism, a religion of mercy, happiness, and salvation for all human beings, always applies its rules to serve the nation and mankind. Understanding this, the BSV has been focusing on improving the lives of the underprivileged, the elderly, women, children, and other marginalized people,"" remarked Most Venerable Thich Thanh Nhieu. For years, the Executive Boards of the BSV in cities and provinces have provided financial assistance to the impoverished in flooded, remote, and mountainous regions, showed gratitude to the families of war invalid soldiers and martyrs by building schools and houses for them, cared for children with disabilities in orphanages and care centres, built charity classes to educate children of impoverished parents, and provided care to the elderly, Agent Orange victims, leprosy, HIV-infected, and mentally ill patients, among others. Last year saw the SBV spending more than VND1,200 billion (US$60 million) on Buddhist charity activities. While Buddhism in its essence is humanism, the nature of charity work means bringing Buddhism to life. The famous declaration of Buddha in the prayer ""Serve all living beings means to worship Buddha"" is the basic principle of the socially engaged Buddhism. Clearly, Buddha realised that the purpose of his life was not to serve himself, but he hoped that through his lectures humans will serve themselves and bring happiness and goodness to everyone. In other words, the very nature of Buddhism is oriented towards serving mankind. This is also a message that Vietnamese Buddhism continues to commit to its volition and enthusiasm to bring equality and happiness to mankind in this years Vesak Day. The five-day event will be held in Bai Dinh pagoda in the northern province of Ninh Binh. — VNS",Sunday,"['pagoda', 'buddhism', 'thanh', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'monk', 'viet', 'shines', 'life', 'thich', 'light', 'darkness']","Inspiring compassion: Monk Thich Thanh Huan (third left) shares his knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection with devotees visiting his pagoda.

HIV children shunned by society,"Despite receiving adequate education and health services, the overwhelming majority of Viet Nam's 457,691 children affected by HIV/AIDS are still blocked from fully integrating with society.",[],2012-11-20,vietnamnews.vn,"HA NOI (VNS)— Despite receiving adequate education and health services, the overwhelming majority of Viet Nams 457,691 children affected by HIV/AIDS are still blocked from fully integrating with society. Thats the view of participants at a recent conference on the protection and care of children with HIV/AIDS, who say social discriminations still serve as a barrier blocking them from fully participating in society. Statistics from the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, showed more than 9,750 out of these children are living with the disease themselves and more than 50 per cent belong to poor families. Ngu Duy Anh, head of the Student Affairs Department under the Ministry of Education and Training, said social stigma and discrimination towards HIV/AIDS-affected children had reduced over the past three years, with most attending classes in centres and schools. ""In particular, there are more than 300 students living with HIV/AIDS who are able to maintain their studying in public shools without meeting any discrimination,"" he said. Nguyen Thi Phuong, director of Ha Nois Social Labour and Education Centre No.2, said voluntary teachers were holding daily classes for affected children taken into care by the centre. In addition, they received tuition from their adoptive mother, brothers and sisters, she added. Phuong said these children also had lots of chances to play games with local children. Anh said nearly 65 per cent of children affected by HIV/AIDS had been offered health care services. More than 3,560 HIV/AIDS children were being treated with the Antiretroviral drug (ARV), 25 times more than seven years ago. Measures to prevent the spread of the disease from mothers to babies had been applied to reduce the large number of new infections. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said the basic rights of many children to access education and health services had yet to be realised. Nguyen Thi Hoan, teacher of Bac Giang Provinces Mo Trang High School said children affected by this disease who suffer social stigma and discrimination would suffer much more than adults and could develop long-term psychological issues. ""However, many are still being driven away from public schools where parents of other students are opposed to integration,"" she said. Doan Mau Diep, deputy minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said it would be a long fight to totally stop social stigma towards the children, so it is necesary to boost communication campaigns and change peoples prejudices about this disease. Anh agreed and said more than 22 million students nationwide would be a main force to remove social discrimination toward the affected children in the coming time, so proper knowledge and preventive measures against HIV/AIDS were being integrated into main teaching subjects such as biology, literature, geography and civics. In addition, extra-curricular activies with themes of HIV/AIDS were also held regularly at schools from kindergartens right up to higher-education level, he said. There were also meetings for parents providing basic information about the disease, he added. Phuc asked relevant agencies to update statistics about children living with and affected by this disease, so that proper assistance policies can be developed.— VNS",Society,"['social', 'affected', 'services', 'students', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'discrimination', 'society', 'stigma', 'shunned', 'education', 'children']","HA NOI (VNS)— Despite receiving adequate education and health services, the overwhelming majority of Viet Nam's 457,691 children affected by HIV/AIDS are still blocked from fully integrating with society.

"More needs to be done to fight HIV infection, support victims",Viet Nam News spoke with US Ambassador to Viet Nam Michael W Marine about the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam.,[],2007-08-01,vietnamnews.vn,"More needs to be done to fight HIV infection, support victims (02-08-2007) Viet Nam News spoke with US Ambassador to Viet Nam Michael W Marine about the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam. What is your assessment of the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam in comparison with other countries around the world and particularly with the 14 other focus countries of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar)? Well, HIV/AIDS is different in various countries around the world. We have a problem with HIV/AIDS in the United States as well. Here in Viet Nam it is an epidemic that has been concentrated, for the most part, among high-risk groups, including people who use injected drugs and commercial sex workers, but there are signs that the epidemic is beginning to spill out again into the general population and that is very worrisome. The HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam is serious but I know the percentage of cases is lower than Pepfar’s 14 other countries which should mean we can have great success because the epidemic is still relatively limited. But to succeed takes great efforts. Its not just the health-care workers but the educators, the Ministry of Labour, public security; many levels of government that have a role to play in this effort. More needs to be done to create greater lines of communication and make efforts even more effective. I think a tremendous amount of good work is being done, led by the Ministry of Health but involving many other people. The US is the single largest bilateral donor to Viet Nam and we’re also a major donor to the Global Fund. There are three aspects in dealing with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam and around the world: prevention – preventing new cases; treatment - improving treatment and helping people who are HIV positive or have AIDS; and care – this is a complex issue but involves helping people who have been affected by being a member of a family where HIV/AIDS is present, the orphans who have lost parents to HIV/AIDS and providing care for people who are at any stage of the illness, particularly those who are dying and for whom treatment won’t be effective. In terms of treatment and care there is still much work to be accomplished but we are doing a good job. In the area of prevention however, I am concerned, we have not yet reached - and this is not only in Viet Nam but around the world – to the point where we are preventing enough cases. There are too many new cases, too many new infections. We now have ways of keeping people alive through drugs and enabling them to live full lives. But that is expensive. There is a cost to society and if there are too many new cases the bill keeps going up, and that is very worrisome. How has the situation changed since your arrival in 2004 when Viet Nam became the 15th member country of the Pepfar programme? It has changed a good deal, we have a lot more money now to work with. The funding through the Pepfar mechanism has given us more resources to tackle HIV/AIDS here in Vietnam. I have seen a significant increase in joint efforts among the various donors to consolidate what we are doing, to co-ordinate, and ensure we are covering as much of the problem as possible without overlap. I have also seen a much improved level of dialogue and co-operation between the donor community and the Government. As I said earlier, because there are still more than 100 people each day becoming HIV positive in Viet Nam, we cannot relax, we are not winning yet, we are doing better but we are still not winning. We need to work harder and smarter. Until we can educate people about what HIV is and what it is not, there are people who will still find themselves infected, we need to improve prevention efforts in a concrete way. The amount of money Pepfar spent on the fight went up from US$34 million in the 2006 fiscal year to $66 million for 2007, it is a sign that there is good work to be done but we still need more money. With $25 million we can make limited efforts; with $65 million we can do more things, expand our consul and testing programme, we can build new partnerships with laboratories to increase our capacity for testing. More funding is needed to defeat the epidemic. We now have quite a bit of money, we need to use that money well, we need to have effective programmes working on prevention, treatment and care. The Pepfar money is only part of it. There is the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, the British Government and the Global Fund - which is something many donors contribute to - specifically dealing with HIV, Malaria and TB. The whole idea of Pepfar is results. What we call goals. We want to have 22,000 people receiving treatment in Viet Nam by the end of 2008. Another target is preventing over 600,000 cases. Measuring success in terms of cases is very difficult. You can’t necessarily attribute results to particular programs, but we do try to measure results and that makes it easier to go back to Congress and ask for additional funding. You know that President Bush has announced that he wants Pepfar to continue. Pepfar was originally organised for the period between 2004 and 2008, now we are planning for the second phase, between 2009 and 2013. He wants aid to double from $15 billion to $30 billion and that is a large amount of money. But it goes back to what I said earlier, if we don’t succeed in prevention, no amount of money will be enough. You will have to keep spending money on treatment, that is why prevention is so important. What are the current challenges in carrying out the programme in Viet Nam? We have to keep up good lines of communication with our partners. I meet with the leadership of the Pepfar team every two weeks and we discuss what needs to be done. I think an issue besides prevention is stigma and discrimination, how do we integrate the people who are HIV positive or have AIDS into the community so their children can go to school without any problems, and their neighbours will treat them like anyone else? When I travel around the country I talk to leaders at the provincial level. I think most of them are trying to deal with this issue. Things have improved in Viet Nam since the new HIV/AIDS law was passed but if you went outside and talked to people on the street you would find there is still prejudice, misconception and misunderstanding about how you can get it and what that means. All that needs to be changed. What will be the challenges for Viet Nam over the next five years? I think the challenges will be as I already described them. Good lines of communication between the government and non-government organisations. Efforts to increase public diplomacy. Efforts to integrate. Coming up with an effective strategy and plan for dealing with the prevention issue. There are many aspects, for example I believe that there has to be a component in the educational system that teaches about HIV/AIDS. That doesn’t mean every week, but once or twice in the school year. It needs to be age sensitive, it needs to be good information and presented in a way that young people can understand.",Opinion,"['treatment', 'cases', 'infection', 'fight', 'nam', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'needs', 'money', 'prevention', 'good', 'efforts', 'pepfar', 'victims', 'support']","More needs to be done to fight HIV infection, support victims(02-08-2007)Viet Nam News spoke with US Ambassador to Viet Nam Michael W Marine about the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam.

At the meeting, entitled ""Protect women and children in a world of AIDS"", many women described their experiences of living with the dreaded disease. Nguyen Thi Le, a member of ""dong cam"" (sympathy), a social advocacy group, in An Lu Commune, Thuy Nguyen District, had to fight social discrimination after her husband died of HIV/AIDS.

Drama sheds light on HIV/AIDS,The Youth Theatre on Monday hosted a special art performance programme at the HCM City Opera House in response to World AIDS Day and the country’s national action month for HIV/AIDS control (November 10-December 10).,[],2009-12-11,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — The Youth Theatre on Monday hosted a special art performance programme at the HCM City Opera House in response to World AIDS Day and the country’s national action month for HIV/AIDS control (November 10-December 10). The programme has received support from the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The main part of the programme was the drama Stereo Man and the Destinations of Lives, which was developed based on the original Stereo Man directed and choreographed by Acnes Locsin from the Philippines. The performance was the outcome of cooperation between the Youth Theatre and PEPFAR as part of the project Art for Development in Viet Nam. The drama addresses the spiritual and physical lives of young people who are exposed to HIV/AIDS risks, and emphasises their humanity. “Over the next five years, the US will place a renewed emphasis on partnering with Viet Nam to build a national HIV/AIDS response,” said US Consul General Kenneth J Fairfax. “We will continue to work together with all sectors of the Vietnamese government and society as they craft strategies and programmes to stop HIV/AIDS,” Fairfax said. Since 2004, the US government has provided more than US$320 million through PEPFAR to comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and support activities nationwide. Currently, more than 30,700 AIDS patients in the country have access to anti-retroviral treatment, as well as more than 3,300 pregnant women infected with HIV. In addition, more than 260,000 people have taken part in voluntary counseling and testing services this year.

Project aims to slow down HIV by improving addicts' treatment,"The treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts as a means to prevent HIV/AIDS is expected to improve with the launch of a new project by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs last week.",[],2011-09-22,vietnamnews.vn,"Trainees work at the embroidery workshop of the Phu Van Rehabilitation Centre in HCM City. — VNA/VNS Photo The Anh HCM CITY — The treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts as a means to prevent HIV/AIDS is expected to improve with the launch of a new project by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs last week. The US$2.5 million project, funded by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, would be implemented until September 2014 in HCM City and the northern province of Thai Nguyen, deputy head of the Social Evils Prevention Department (SEPD) Do Thi Ninh Xuan said. Its objectives are to strengthen the ministry (MoLISA) s capacity to treat and rehabilitate drug addicts through effective approach methods to reduce drug use, improve the quality of life, and reduce HIV infection among drug users and prostitutes. The project is setting up a data collection and management system on drug addicts, prostitutes and addicted prostitutes, according to MoLISA. The capacity of the ministrys staff to analyse and utilise data will be also improved. Viet Nam has close to 150,000 registered addicts, a figure that has been growing by 6,000 a year since. All 63 cities and provinces have them. Along with the increase, the demographics of drug addicts underwent remarkable change, MoLISA said. In the mid-1990s drug use was common among people living in the northern mountains. Since the mid-2000s the number of addicts has been increasing rapidly in the Red River Delta and south-eastern regions. The addicts have also been growing younger – in 2010 around 70 per cent were under 30 compared to 42 per cent in 1995. More than 95 per cent of users in Viet Nam are men. But the number of women addicts has been increasing. The method of use has also changed: in 1995 less than 8 per cent were injecting drugs while more than 88 per cent were smoking them; 14 years later three-fourths of addicts are intravenous users. This has led to an alarming rise in HIV infection. Figures from the Ministry of Health show that addicts using needles account for most of the people with HIV. A recent MoLISA survey found that the majority of the drug addicts were poorly educated with more than half not going to high school and 10 per cent being illiterate, only 12 per cent getting vocational training. With drug abuse rising, MoLISA said treatment of addicts and training to help them return to the community and integrate was essential. It said it planned to review the rehabilitation system for investment in community-based treatment and improved management. A number of models would be tried to treat some 500 addicts.",Society,"['ministry', 'project', 'molisa', 'hcm', 'hiv', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'addicts', 'aims', 'cent', 'number', 'slow', 'improving', 'treatment']","Its objectives are to strengthen the ministry (MoLISA) 's capacity to treat and rehabilitate drug addicts through effective approach methods to reduce drug use, improve the quality of life, and reduce HIV infection among drug users and prostitutes.

Role of leadership highlighted in the fight against HIV/AIDS,"While Viet Nam is forecast to be on the verge of an HIV/AIDS outbreak, many believe the role of leadership in combating the pandemic is very important.",[],2006-01-11,vietnamnews.vn,"Role of leadership highlighted in the fight against HIV/AIDS (11-01-2006) Doctors check samples for the HIV virus in the northern mountain province of Yen Bai.— VNA/VNS Photo Huu Oai HA NOI — While Viet Nam is forecast to be on the verge of an HIV/AIDS outbreak, many believe the role of leadership in combating the pandemic is very important. ""As the disease has claimed the lives of thousands of people, the role of leaders in nations fighting HIV/AIDS is of dire importance,"" said Tommy G Thompson, former secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. Thompson chairs the 13-member delegation visiting Viet Nam to evaluate the HIV pandemic in Viet Nam, assess current national efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, including critical gaps and emerging challenges, and identify opportunities for pre-emptive US engagement to help fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. 100,000 living with AIDS Viet Nam has had more than 100,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, according to a report released by the Health Ministry at the end of last year. About 11,000 people have died of the disease. Yet, it is believed the actual number of HIV/AIDS carriers is much higher. Associate professor Luu Thi Minh Chau at the Health Ministry said the number of people with HIV/AIDS is forecast around two to three times higher than the reported figures. Chau warned that Viet Nam, like other countries in Asia, will likely suffer from an HIV/AIDS outbreak in the early years of the 21st century if drastic measures are not carried out in a timely manner. The situation has become critical as the country is increasingly open, exposing the population to the disease through sexually transmitted diseases and drugs, she added. Viet Nam is one of fifteen ‘focus’ countries identified as countries most at risk for an HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are the beneficiaries of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, a five-year, US$15 billion, US global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS. In addition to completing a series of objectives in stopping the spread of the disease, the programme also aims to strengthen the role of leadership in fighting HIV/AIDS. Last year, Viet Nam received a total of US$25 million from the programme. Like other beneficiaries, Viet Nam expects to receive further support from the PEPFAR programme to obtain better results in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The country has received support from other international organisations to combat HIV/AIDS, of which the US PEPFAR programme is one. ""Viet Nam is grateful to the US Government for supporting the country in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS,"" said Dao Duy Quat, deputy head of the Party Central Commission for Ideological and Cultural Affairs. Quat told Thompson at a meeting on Monday in Ha Noi that Vietnamese leaders have been very involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS over the past decade. ""We are combating the pandemic to save not only people living with HIV/AIDS but also to save the whole nation,"" Quat said. As soon as the first HIV case was discovered in Viet Nam more than 10 years ago, the Party was very prompt to issue a directive on HIV/AIDS prevention and protection in 1995. It was followed by the promulgation of an HIV/AIDS prevention and protection ordinance. Viet Nam also has a legal framework for the protection and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The issuance of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection strategies and the imminent introduction of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection laws are efforts the country has made to combat the pandemic. Quat said Viet Nam has also attached great importance to disseminating information and educating people about HIV/AIDS. ""With the implementation of policies and the help of international orga-nisations, Viet Nam believes it will be able to stop the pandemic,"" he told his host.",Society,"['leadership', 'fight', 'nam', 'highlighted', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'prevention', 'pandemic', 'protection', 'countries', 'role', 'country']","Viet Nam is one of fifteen ‘focus’ countries identified as countries most at risk for an HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Children: the forgotten victims of HIV,World AIDS Day next Tuesday will highlight a human rights-based approach to dealing with the scourge .,[],2009-11-26,vietnamnews.vn,"Outlook (27-11-2009) Children: the forgotten victims of HIV World AIDS Day next Tuesday will highlight a human rights-based approach to dealing with the scourge. by Nguyen Kieu Van Viet Nam continued to set an example for the Asia-Pacific region when Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved the National Plan of Action for Children Living with and Affected by HIV/AIDS in June. The plan to 2010 with a vision to 2020 was part of Viet Nam’s response to the appeal for governments to provide such action at the East Asia and Pacific Regional Consultation on HIV-AIDS conference in Ha Noi in 2006. But while the efforts of Viet Nam’s and other Asia-Pacific-country governments to implement healthcare policies and support for children living with and affected by HIV-AIDS have been acknowledged, the results have not always matched the expectations of those whose lives have been blighted by the virus. As United Nations Children’s Fund, or UNICEF, representative in Viet Nam Jesper Morch explains: ""Viet Nam has excellent policies and legislation in place. But policies and legislation are sometimes difficult to enforce."" Double burden Many of the affected children carry a double burden: Not only have they lost one or both parents to AIDS or are living with the HIV virus themselves; they are also without caregivers and lack the opportunity to learn. Vietnamese Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, who well knows the plight of these children, puts it best: ""The pain to their spirit following the death of their parents is made much worse by the discrimination they suffer from those around them."" The epidemic has limited their basic rights. But progress is being made. A UNAIDS report issued in Shanghai on Tuesday says HIV infections have fallen 17 per cent over the past eight years. The heaviest fall was in East Asia - almost 25 per cent. ""The good news is that we have evidence that the declines we are seeing are due, at least in part, to HIV prevention,"" says UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe. ""If we do a better job of getting resources and programmes to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved."" The Indonesian National AIDS Commission has provided a particularly impressive initiative with the extension of a life-skills education programme that empowers communities in the management of the virus in the country’s remote Papua Province. UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office director Anupama Rao Singh is also quick to acknowledge the progress but advises: ""Governments and civil societies should strengthen the evidence about the impact AIDS has on children and put them on a properly costed National Strategic Plan for protection, prevention care and support. ""Given the low-level and concentrated nature of the HIV pandemic in the Asia-Pacific, the best response is to engage in integrated programmes to promote overall child welfare and reduce poverty,"" she says. In addition to the early identification of the disease, policies to support AIDS orphans through loans or job training are also necessary. Such programmes should begin at the grassroots. Many government and NGO studies reveal why such action is necessary. These show that children living with and affected by HIV are more vulnerable to ill health, malnutrition, psychosocial suffering, slowed cognitive development, anxiety, depression, abandonment and abuse. Changing patterns Anupama Rao Singh warns the number of children living with HIV in Asia-Pacific is increasing. ""This is because patterns of HIV infection are changing,"" she says. ""An increasingly large number of women not traditionally considered to be members of high-risk groups are becoming infected."" More than 43 per cent of new infections in Cambodia were among married women and more than a third of all new infections were from mother to child. Most HIV infections in children are transmitted from mother to child and this makes early diagnosis through the universal testing of pregnant women and the provision of ART prophylaxis regimens to those infected crucial. Vietnamese minister Ngan says high-risk children should be a focus of attention. These include drug users; children who have both parents affected by HIV or those who live at social centres; street children and victims of human trafficking or sexual abuse. But the Asia-Pacific has more orphans than anywhere else in the world-an estimated 90 million – and so poor children living with HIV in poor countries are all but overlooked. They receive little support from governments and civil organisations and without money cannot buy the pharmaceutical drugs that would save their lives. Each year an estimated 93 per cent of children living with HIV in poor countries go without access to effective treatment. The result: 18.4 per cent of the world’s yearly AIDS’s dead are children. Most died because their parents did not have access to ART prophylaxis Regimens while their health centres lacked testing equipment and the necessary medicine. The fact that the drugs suitable for children cost four to five times more than those for adults exacerbates the problem. It means that governments, the World Health Organisation and the global pharmaceutical corporations must give priority to HIV testing, examination and the supply of the necessary drugs to the children in poor countries. Doctors Without Borders has set the example. It has supplied free prophylaxis regimens to people living with HIV in 29 poor countries. Surely, most of the beneficiaries were children. UNAIDS estimates number of people living with HIV globally at 33.4 million. The agency puts the number of children afflicted at 2.3 million with 95 per cent of them in poor countries mostly sub-Saharan Africa. — VNS",Opinion,"['poor', 'affected', 'living', 'hiv', 'viet', 'cent', 'aids', 'forgotten', 'policies', 'victims', 'children', 'governments']","These show that children living with and affected by HIV are more vulnerable to ill health, malnutrition, psychosocial suffering, slowed cognitive development, anxiety, depression, abandonment and abuse.

The international Forum on Development, Drugs and HIV in the Highlands of Viet Nam was organised by Viet Nam’s Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). It was held to provide a venue to share information on drug trafficking and abuse, and the spread of HIV among ethnic minorities in the northern mountainous areas. The forum provided participants with a chance to share experiences in preventative work on drug abuse and HIV infection. It also provided Vietnamese authorities with the opportunity to call for support from international organisations, NGOs and the wider community in tackling the problem. Speaking at the forum yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong said that ""Although great efforts have been made to tackle the problems, drug abuse continues to grow, especially with an increasing shift from opium smoking to injecting, which aids the spread of HIV in the northern mountainous areas."" ""Unless proper actions are taken, it is predicted that in the next 5 to 10 years, drug abuse and HIV infection will become serious epidemics in the area, endangering the development of communities in the highlands, where knowledge on the relationship between HIV and injecting drugs is largely non-existent,"" said Trong. Since 2002, the UNODC in partnership with CEM have been carrying out a project on preventing drug abuse among ethnic minorities in Viet Nam. This project has so far obtained initial positive results, contributing to curbing drug abuse. However, according to a report released by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, the highlands region faces serious economic difficulties and rampant drug abuse. Opium poppy cultivation and use has a long history among ethnic minorities, said the report, revealing that in 2005 the number of drug users in the northern mountainous provinces accounted for 37.8 per cent of the country’s total population of known drug users. Notably, since 1999, opium smokers have turned to heroin use. Synthetic drugs have been used in the provinces of Nghe An, Lao Cai, Ha Giang, Son La, Dien Bien and Lai Chau. The past few years have seen an increase in drug injections, accounting for 70-80 per cent of drug use in some areas, and resulting in the rise of HIV/AIDS. The report highlighted the provinces of Nghe An, Thanh Hoa and Yen Bai, where between 80-90 per cent of HIV cases are drug users. According to the UNODC project co-ordinator, Jason Eligh, prevention of drug use and the spread of HIV/AIDS was very important to socio-economic development in the northern highland region, where poor infrastructure has exacerbated the areas remoteness. A workshop on Viet Nam’s NGOs and HIV/AIDS prevention and control was also held in Ha Noi yesterday. Deputy Director of the Viet Nam Administration of AIDS Control Chu Quoc An called on NGOs to co-ordinate activities and develop projects in localities to prevent and control the disease. National strategy Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) should focus their activities on disseminating the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and implementing the national strategy, he said. NGOs had contributed heavily for the country’s HIV/AIDS prevention and control programmes, and many articles of the new law encourages and creates conditions for NGOs to increase their activities, An said. Thanks to the support of NGOs, the number of people and social organisations taking part in the programme has increased. An said there were a dozen NGOs operating in HIV/AIDS prevention and control, but most of them were small or short-term projects. Representatives of NGOs presented reports on activities in localities and provided detailed information on community HIV/AIDS prevention and control. They called for effective co-ordination between State management agencies, social organisations and domestic and international NGOs in order to cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Chung A, an expert on HIV/AIDS, said the NGOs had been operating effectively in the country over the past ten years and Viet Nam was one of the nations that had shown progress in removing stigma and preventing discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients.

ARV medications help people living with HIV strengthen their immune system and thereby decrease the risk of contracting other diseases and illnesses; co-infection is the leading cause of death amongst the HIV/AIDS community in Viet Nam. The Government of Viet Nam first allowed ARV medicines into the country in 2000 but they only became widely used in 2007. ARVs have proven successful in Viet Nam. Before 2007, 7,000-8,000 people died annually from AIDS, but in recent years numbers have been between 1,000-1,500. In 2013, Viet Nam required more than VND350 billion (US$16.6 million) to buy ARVs. The state budget paid for only 6.3 per cent of the needed funds and the rest came from international sponsors. Last year, the country required 400 billion ($19 million) and only 4.4 per cent came from the State budget. With advanced notice about a decrease in financial support this year from Viet Nams two biggest sponsors, the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS and the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the State decided to up its financial support, spending VND85 billion ($4 million) on ARVs. ""But the fund is still not enough to meet the real demand,"" said Duong. According to the VAAC website, the number of patients requiring ARVs will increase by almost 50,000 in the next two years. This means the situation will only get worse if the government cannot find additional sources to pay for the increasing demand for ARV treatment. Duong said that the Ministry of Health proposed some measures to the State to help deal with the funding crisis. The States allocation of ARV funds to localities would depend on how much need they demonstrate, he said. If a province or city can rebalance their funds to loosen up some more funds for ARV, they must do so and expect a little less support than last year. The State would prioritise using this years tight ARV funds to support poor and remote localities first. Provinces and cities were told to instruct locals living with HIV/AIDS to buy health insurance so that insurance can pay for some of their treatment expenses. On the VAAC website, the agency suggested the State to set up a nationwide order for the drug and then deliver to different provinces and cities since buying the drug in bulk reduces the price. — VNS",Society,"['arvs', 'funds', 'state', 'arv', 'lacking', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', 'medicine', 'viet', 'demand', 'support']","The Government of Viet Nam first allowed ARV medicines into the country in 2000 but they only became widely used in 2007.

International aid agencies will stop offering free ARV medicine in the country for patients with HIV next year. Insured anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV patients will begin in June next year once international aid stops, according to the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control. Seventy-two per cent of patients with HIV have health insurance, Hưng said, adding that the city’s People’s Committee had approved funds for the remaining 27 per cent of patients with HIV who cannot afford cards. “Who will treat them? How will we carry out?” Hưng said. “This is the issue to which we should pay more attention.” Many representatives of district-level health centres have complained that they have not been able to set up a general clinic because of a shortage of doctors. Dr Phạm Thị Kim Hoa, head of Cần Giờ District Health Centre, said there were not enough available staff to set up the clinics. Around 110 patients with HIV are being treated at the district’s Community Counselling and Assistance Centre, Hoa said, adding that the centre has sent eight of the 110 patients with HIV to the district’s health stations. The remaining number of patients with HIV have been sent to the district hospital for treatment, but the hospital has not provided treatment, even though the city’s Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention has provided training to the hospital’s doctors. Dr Phan Thành Phước, head of the District 2 Health Centre, suggested that instead of general health clinics, the department should allow district-level hospitals to set up a satellite department for ART treatment under health insurance. The Health Department plans to merge all district-level hospitals and health centres by 2020 in order to solve the shortage of doctors and ensure treatment for patients with HIV with health insurance. Thủ Đức and Hóc Môn district hospitals and health centres will be the first to merge this year. Dr Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, head of the city’s Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention, said that interruption in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for patients with HIV/AIDS raised the risk of spreading the virus in the community. This could lead to a failure to achieve the UN’s 90-90-90 goals by 2020. The goals are to have at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV know their status and 90 per cent receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART). The goals call for 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy to be eventually diagnosed with viral suppression. — VNS",Society,"['department', 'clinics', 'patients', 'general', 'hospitals', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'urgently', 'centre', 'cent', 'needed', 'district', 'official', 'treatment', 'health']","Insured anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV patients will begin in June next year once international aid stops, according to the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control.

Currently, about 50 per cent of Việt Nam ’s HIV-infected people are being treated with ARV. The Health Ministry, Financial Ministry and Việt Nam Social Insurance must work together to ensure enough ARV drugs are available. State and local budgets must be generous enough to cover the drug supply, he said. ‘The treatments must be more convenient and sensitive to the patients’ mental and emotional needs,” he said. According to Deputy Minister of Public Security Lê Quý Vương, 6,883 new people tested positive for HIV in the first nine months of this year. As many as 3,484 HIV patients saw their illness progress to AIDS and 1,260 patients died. It is estimated that the number of new cases of people living with HIV will reach 9,800 by the end of 2017, while the number of deaths will climb to some 1, 800. Vương said that the number of newly HIV-infected people had decreased. This year had also been the ninth year in a row to see decreases in the number of new infections, the number of HIV cases that have turned to AIDS and the number of deaths. Deputy Prime Minister Đam said that the HIV/AIDS work should not be neglected as the number of infections declines. Growing drug addiction According to the Ministry of Public Security, there was a surge in the number of drug criminals this year. In the first nine months of this year, more than 906 kg of heroin were seized, an increase of 49 per cent over the same period last year. More than 856 kg and over 979,000 synthetic drug tablets were seized, a hike of 129 per cent compared to last year. Đam said that without drastic measures, tackling synthetic drugs and growing drug addiction would be challenges. The Health Ministry has set up treatment guidelines. Sectors and localities must promote communication through video clips and programmes to warn people about the risks of synthetic drugs. Đam said that local leaders must change attitudes towards drug treatment. The purpose of drug rehabilitation efforts, he said, is not to “purify” an area but to ensure addicted people can return to their communities and receive appropriate treatment as social order is maintained. Đam urged localities to sustain the use of methadone in treating drug addiction. He said that there were 408 locations nationwide where prostitutes were known to work. He ordered the provinces and cities to implement projects to reduce the number to 200 by the end of next year. Officials at the meeting announced a methadone treatment management system at methadone.vaac.gov.vn, aiming to support patients being treated with methadone and link patients with treatment facilities. Each patient will have an ID and electronic medical record to manage their treatment. They can take the medicine at any facility without having to bring their records with them. Using this app, they can make appointments and select treatment locations. The system will show patients the nearest location where they can access the medicine. - VNS",Society,"['ministry', 'number', 'patients', 'việt', 'vn', 'hiv', 'drug', 'synthetic', 'aims', 'cent', 'rise', 'halt', 'treat', 'work', 'treatment']","The Health Ministry, Financial Ministry and Việt Nam Social Insurance must work together to ensure enough ARV drugs are available.

Twenty-one of the city’s 24 health centres (formerly known as preventive health centres) offer treatment for HIV/AIDS patients and preventive health services. Many of these centres, however, have not signed contracts with the Việt Nam Social Security agency, and thus, patients with HIV/AIDS, even those with health insurance cards, cannot be insured. Dr Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, head of the city’s Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention, at a meeting between the department and its health centres held this week, said that the centres which lack conditions to upgrade to a general health clinic should merge with district-level hospitals to ensure continuity of treatment for HIV/AIDS patients as well as health insurance coverage. “If patients with HIV/AIDS stop using anti-retroviral (ARV) medicine for one week, they will become resistant to the medicine, leading to a problem of epidemic control in the city,” Vân said. The cost for treatment for patients who are resistant to the drug would not be covered by insurance, Vân said, adding that the cost is five to 10 times higher than the usual treatment given before drug-resistance. International aid to Việt Nam that covers the costs of ARV drugs is gradually being reduced and will completely end by 2020, Vân said. At the beginning of the year, state insurance funds will start covering costs for ARV drugs. If health centres are able to upgrade to general clinics, they could then sign contracts for insured examinations and drug treatment with the Việt Nam Social Security agency. If the health centres merge with district-level hospitals, they would transfer their patients with HIV/AIDS to the hospital to receive ARV medicine and other treatment covered by health insurance, according to Vân. Health insurance cards “Of the surveyed 28,000 patients with HIV/AIDS in the city, 72 per cent have health insurance cards,” Vân said. The city People’s Committee has approved purchase of health insurance cards for all patients with HIV/AIDS who have HCM City household registration books or temporary resident status for six months, she added. At least 90 per cent of insured patients with HIV/AIDS do not use their health cards as most of the facilities where they go for treatment have no contracts with Việt Nam Social Security. By December, the Ministry of Health will provide ARV drugs to the city’s Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Phạm Ngọc Thạch Hospital, District 1 Hospital, Tân Phú District Hospital, Thủ Đức District Hospital and health centres in the districts of Tân Phú, Thủ Đức and Bình Chánh that have the capacity to upgrade to general health clinics.

Khánh Hòa faces dearth of HIV health workers,Health authorities in Nha Trang City – the famous beach tourism destination hit hard by HIV/AIDS – have made progress against the epidemic. But their efforts are threatened by a lack of adequate human resources.,[],2017-09-14,vietnamnews.vn,"KHÁNH HÒA – Health authorities in Nha Trang City – the famous beach tourism destination hit hard by HIV/AIDS – have made progress against the epidemic. However, their efforts are threatened by a lack of adequate human resources. The first HIV/AIDS patient in Khánh Hòa Province, where Nha Trang is located, was discovered in 1993, three years after Việt Nam detected its first HIV/AIDS patient. Khánh Hòa Province used to rank in the top 10 provinces for number of HIV-infected people. In the 2002-03 period, it ranked as high as the second most-infected, following HCM City. But since 2012, it hasn’t made the list, said Dr Trần Văn Tín, director of the province’s HIVAIDS Prevention Centre. Doctors believe that in recent years, both the number of new HIV infections and deaths has declined. Furthermore, the number of HIV-infected people being treated has increased so that 76 per cent of all people with HIV are being treated at provincial health centres and hospitals. But the prevention work faces many challenges, especially lack of human resources for HIVAIDS prevention. There aren’t enough health staff, doctors and social workers, according to Dr Trần Văn Tín. Only two doctors at the provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre are now in charge of treating 350 people with HIV by methadone, and another 100 others with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. In terms of funding for HIVAIDS prevention work, Dr Tín said that in the past, the province had received about VNĐ11 billion from various foreign and domestic organizations ever year. But recently, only VNĐ2.4 billion from the provincial budget has been spent on health sector every year. And since 2016, there has been no funding for human resources training and development. The HIV prevention work was extremely difficult, and the pressure to make progress was great, the director said. The lack of adequately trained doctors, nurses and other health professionals required everyone to stretch themselves thin on the job. “I am in charge of both managing and directly treating patients, even preparing medical file and editing text,” said Tín. In Khánh Hòa – a province thriving in all aspects and operating with a market economy ---- many doctors were happy to leave the district-level health centres when they found other jobs with higher incomes. This made it difficult for the HIV/AIDS centres to retain employees. The brain drain is a common situation not only in the province, but also in localities across the country. At the centre, if one or two doctors took a day off, hundreds of prescriptions and patient files piled up and awaited their return. In the past five years, Tín said, he has sent requests many times to the provincial Department of Health to recruit more doctors and health staff. While every year, hundreds of doctors submitted applications to Khánh Hòa’s hospitals, no doctor has been sent to the centre. “There has been great pressure for many years, the Department of Health has called, but still not recruited doctors for the HIV centre,” he said. “Because no one wants to do HIV.” Lâm Quang Chứng, deputy director of the Khánh Hòa Province’s Department of Health, said it knew the situation of the doctor shortage in HIV centre. Not only the HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, but also departments of dermatology, tuberculosis, forensics, and psychiatry have been dealing with doctor shortages, Chứng said. He stressed that after the implementation of the Government’s policy on attracting human resources to rural areas, the provincial health sector was building a proposal for a long-term health worker development strategy. — VNS",Society,"['provincial', 'province', 'doctors', 'hòa', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'prevention', 'human', 'faces', 'dearth', 'khánh', 'workers', 'health']","KHÁNH HÒA – Health authorities in Nha Trang City – the famous beach tourism destination hit hard by HIV/AIDS – have made progress against the epidemic.

Three years ago, the thin woman from northern Thai Nguyen Provinces Dai Tu District never thought she would be so happy. That year, Luong lost her husband and first child to HIV/AIDS and found out she too was infected with the virus. But with the support of her friends and continued counseling, as well as the help of the local branch of Hoa Huong Duong (Sun Flower) Club, an organisation that provides care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS, Luong eventually gained back her sense of self. When she joined the club of 100 HIV-infected members— 83 of whom were women—Luong found that having HIV did not mean her life was over. Through monthly discussions, Luong learned about how to deal with her condition. However, the club sessions did not address her primary longing: a baby. Last year, after much counseling, Luong and her new partner decided to go through with a pregnancy. ""Nobody supports our decision. Neighbours and relatives, even my sister, believed that I would transmit the deadly virus to my baby and it would be a burden to society after I died,"" Luong said. However, Luong is now four months pregnant and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ARV). She strongly believes that her baby will be born without the virus. ""My partner and I are building our house and preparing everything to welcome our baby,"" Luong said. Another woman from Ha Thuong Commune, 33-year-old Tran Thi Thu, has the same desire as Luong but failed twice to become a mother. Her five-year-old daughter died of the disease five years ago; her son followed, only one hour after coming into the world. ""I participate in several projects for HIV, which makes me busy the whole day. But after work, Im a lonely woman in the cold house where I so longed to have a child,"" Thu said. She expressed determination to try to have another baby next year. ""Even living with HIV, a woman still deserves to have her own baby,"" Thu said. ""As long as you are optimistic, I strongly believe that God will not let you down whether you are a healthy person or an HIV sufferer."" Luong and Thus desire to have a baby is common among HIV-infected women in the district, according to Dinh Thi Xuan, head of Hoa Huong Duong club. ""All female HIV carriers in the club talk about their burning desire to have children,"" she said. Xuan added that three members of the club have children who tested negative for HIV. This encouraged other women not to give up hope of having healthy children. ""I will also have a baby when my financial state is better,"" Xuan confided. Without preventive intervention, between 20 and 45 per cent of infants born to HIV-positive mothers contract HIV through mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The proportion can be reduced to less than 10 per cent through a combination of prevention measures, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the expectant mother and her newborn child, hygienic delivery conditions and safe infant feeding. Thai Nguyen ranks fourth out of ten provinces nationwide with the highest number of HIV cases, according to the provincial department of health. Over 9,000 HIV cases have been reported throughout the province, 19 per cent of them women. The risk of mother-to-child transmission reported in the province last year was six per cent, said vice director of the provinces HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre Truong Binh Minh. ""Motherhood is stipulated to be the legal right of women following the Viet Nam Population Ordinance so nobody can prevent HIV-positive women from having children,"" he said. However, Minh recommended those women ask for counselors advice before having children during pregnancy and after delivery. In addition, they should take account of factors that affect a womans ability to bring up the child such as financial condition, job and support from relatives. ""Scientists have not found any drugs to eradicate HIV/AIDS, so both HIV-positive women and their children face the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Thus, the government should pay attention to the fact that HIV women are choosing to have children,"" Minh said. The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) officially states that parents living with HIV have their sexual reproductive rights protected and can have HIV-free babies. ""All women have the right to choice when it comes to exercising their sexual and reproductive health and rights and protecting themselves from risk of HIV infection,"" said UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director, Management and Governance, Jan Beagle. ""AIDS is much more than a health issue, it is a development issue, a rights issue, and it is clear that gender equality and human rights are non-negotiable elements to ensure effective HIV and health responses as well as social justice for all."" In a recent UNAIDS survey, women living with HIV expressed concern about the advice given by many health workers and authorities to avoid having children. They also complained that they lacked information about how to have a safe pregnancy and deliver an HIV-negative child. ""People living with HIV aim to live in a world that protects their sexual and reproductive rights,"" the survey concluded. The authors added that this required training health providers to teach HIV-positive individuals considering becoming pregnant about safe conception methods as well as changes in regulations to improve access to fertility procedures that reduced the risk of passing on the virus. — VNS",Society,"['woman', 'baby', 'women', 'living', 'hiv', 'nguyen', 'rights', 'hivpositive', 'treatments', 'empower', 'luong', 'children', 'mothers', 'health']","A woman living with HIV has an ultrasound.

Hepatitis C patients find treatment too expensive,A former intravenous drug user in HCM City had the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for many years but did not know about it.,[],2018-12-19,vietnamnews.vn,"Gia Lộc HCM CITY— A former intravenous drug user in HCM City had the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for many years but did not know about it. Through a pilot project for raising HCV awareness among high-risk populations in the city and screening for the disease, she recently came to know about her status. But she said in tears, “I cannot get treatment because I cannot afford the medicines.” The medicines alone cost VNĐ7.5-15 million (US$322- $644) a month, whether at private or public hospitals. Dr Vũ Ngọc Bảo, deputy programme director of HIV/TB at PATH, a global NGO, said high-risk populations cannot afford HCV screening, diagnosis and treatment costs. According to Nguyễn Đăng Tấn Lộc, an HCV and HIV counsellor at Galant Clinic, the demand for HCV testing among the clinic’s patients is high, and when they find out they are infected, they face high treatment costs. “Even if health insurance covers 50 per cent of the treatment costs, many of them cannot afford the rest because their incomes are too low.” At his clinic, HCV patients could pay in instalments for their treatment, he added. Dr Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, director of the HCM City HIV/ADIS Prevention Centre, called on pharmaceutical companies to reduce drug prices. Many people at high risk of contracting HCV in the country are also those who are at increased risk of HIV, including people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men (MSM), according to a press release from PATH. PATH works to accelerate health equity by bringing together public institutions, businesses, social enterprises, and investors to solve the world’s most pressing health challenges. HCV is an infectious disease that can result in serious liver damage and death. Many people with HCV have no symptoms until long-term infection gives way to these serious consequences. The virus spreads through the blood of an infected person. Up to 4 per cent of the Vietnamese population has evidence of exposure to HCV, with many developing long-term infection. Since January 2018 PATH, the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, Gilead Sciences, and private clinics and community-based organisations (CBOs) in the city have collaborated for a new approach to increase awareness and expand access to HCV testing among those most at risk of infection. It built on the platform developed by USAID/PATH Healthy Markets and the Việt Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) to increase access to HIV services for key populations by integrating HCV information and services into established community-based services and communication channels. “The introduction of community-based testing for HIV in Việt Nam provides a strong platform and timely opportunity for also increasing awareness and uptake of HCV testing among [high-risk] groups,” Vân said. An assessment done by the project found that most people at risk of HCV did not know about the risks and consequences of HCV, where to go for screening, diagnosis and treatment or how to prevent HCV. In response, PATH, HCMC PAC, Gilead, private clinics, and CBOs worked together to develop educational and behavioural changes and a demand creation campaign called ‘Healthy Liver, Happy Life’. This campaign mobilised social media networks, community-led offline events, and in-clinic counselling (integrated into counseling for HIV testing and other HIV-related services) to raise awareness of HCV and encourage people to engage in HCV testing. Concerns about discrimination at testing facilities were also barriers to testing and so this project leveraged USAID/PATH Healthy Markets and the VAAC’s experience in introducing community-based HIV testing to reach those most at risk of HCV. Studies conducted by USAID/PATH Healthy Markets found that PWID (people who inject drugs) and MSM lay health workers (CBO staff and peers) in the city were just as skilled as trained healthcare workers in delivering HIV tests and significantly more likely to reach new HIV testers. Those testing at PWID and MSM-led CBOs and clinics are also more likely to be HIV positive than those testing at public facilities since many of them prefer to receive services from people they know and trust. Following these lessons, this pilot project enabled HIV positive and negative and PWID and MSM groups to access quick and easy HCV testing through community-led private clinics and CBOs, often at the same time as testing for HIV. Trained staff offered rapid diagnostic tests that require a small amount of blood from the prick of a finger. The process is simple, safe, and painless. If the test was positive, people were assisted with confirmatory diagnosis and treatment. Since April this year 3,116 people have undergone HCV testing. As many as 217 received a reactive result with the rapid test, and 111 were subsequently diagnosed with HCV and linked to further medical care. “The path to eliminating hepatitis C starts with awareness, screening and diagnosis,” Boon-Leong Neo, senior director, public health & medical affairs, at Gilead Sciences, said. The clinics involved in this pilot will continue to provide integrated HIV and HCV counselling, screening and linkages to care. Community-based organisations will also continue to provide information, counselling and referrals to HCV services at the same time as providing HIV services. PATH and Gilead will each continue to seek opportunities to advocate for the further development of community-based HCV services in HCM City and across Việt Nam, including raising awareness and increasing access to care. —VNS",Society,"['testing', 'clinics', 'patients', 'city', 'services', 'awareness', 'hiv', 'hepatitis', 'c', 'screening', 'risk', 'expensive', 'hcv', 'treatment']","Gia LộcHCM CITY— A former intravenous drug user in HCM City had the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for many years but did not know about it.

"VN falls short in AIDS, drugs, prostitution fight","Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam has urged ministries and agencies to enhance measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, drugs and prostitution from now to the end of the year, according to the Government Office’s announcement.",[],2016-09-22,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam has urged ministries and agencies to enhance measures to prevent and control HIV/AIDS, drugs and prostitution from now to the end of the year, the Government Office has announced. A conference of the Standing Board of the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Prevention to review work so far this year and set tasks for the remaining months on Tuesday heard that the country recorded some positive achievements during the period but many challenges remained. These challenges included the number of drug addicts in methadone treatment falling short of Government targets, slow renovation of drug detoxification, an increase in methamphetamine trafficking and use and a rising number of drug addicts. Communication works on HIV/AIDS, drugs and prostitution prevention and control remain limited and shortcomings still exist in regulations, heard the conference. To help tackle these difficulties, the Deputy PM asked the Ministry of Public Security to submit the 2016-2020 programme on drug prevention to the Government and help other agencies amend the Law on Drug Prevention and Control. The ministry was also urged to collaborate with the Ministry of Defence to tackle drugs in border areas. As Chairman of the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Prevention, Đam requested the Ministry of Health guide the use of methadone for drug addiction treatment and establish antiretroviral treatment management systems. The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs was asked to improve prostitution prevention while the Ministry of Justice will consider an administrative punishment on drug users. The Deputy PM instructed local people’s committees to mobilise resources from the community for the fight against AIDS, drugs and prostitution, and link the work with socio-economic development. Việt Nam had some 227,150 HIV patients by the end of 2015, and estimated that there were about 254,000 HIV-infected people in the country. The country aims to eliminate the HIV/AIDS pandemic by 2030.

VN seeks international assistance to avoid AIDS resurgence,Việt Nam is seeking international assistance with HIV/AIDS prevention and control to avoid a resurgence of the disease.,[],2016-05-26,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam is seeking international assistance with HIV/AIDS prevention and control to avoid a resurgence of the disease. This was revealed by health officials yesterday at the stakeholder consultation on the upcoming high-level meeting on ending AIDS. Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the health ministry’s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Prevention and Control Vũ Đức Đam would attend the high-level meeting, organised by the United Nations, next month. Calling for international assistance would be one of the key messages Việt Nam’s delegation intends to deliver at the UN meeting, he said. Other messages include Việt Nam’s progress in HIV/AIDS control, the challenges it has faced in fighting the disease and the country’s appreciation of international support. Long said the deputy PM was especially interested in bringing the voice of the people living with HIV/AIDS to the world’s notice. The AIDS department and UNAIDS in Việt Nam have organised four consultation workshops to gather opinions that may help enhance Việt Nam’s contributions to the meeting. The fourth consultation yesterday focused on the need to strengthen access to services for people living with HIV/AIDS and for vulnerable groups, the demand for an improved legal framework and the need to secure the sufferers’ human rights. Co-operation with non-State partners was also discussed. According to the AIDS department, Việt Nam has made great strides in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. For example, the number of newly infected people each year dropped from 18,000 in 2010 to some 10,000 in 2015. The death toll fell from 3,200 people in 2010 to some 2,000 people in 2015. Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is said to be on the decline. However, major challenges remain, including the increasing number of women being infected and reduced financial support from international donors. In 2014, the country announced its commitment to set new targets intended to rapidly expand HIV treatment, making it the first Asian country to adopt the 90–90–90 target. This means that 90 per cent of people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of people who know their status will be on HIV treatment; and 90 per cent of all people on treatment will achieve undetectable levels of HIV in their body (known as viral suppression). Around the world, momentum is building behind reaching this target by 2020. Viet Nam’s commitment to this ambitious target puts the country on course to ending its AIDS epidemic by 2030. — VNS",Society,"['treatment', 'international', 'việt', 'vn', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'avoid', 'prevention', 'aids', 'nams', 'control', 'seeks', 'assistance', 'resurgence']","HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam is seeking international assistance with HIV/AIDS prevention and control to avoid a resurgence of the disease.

Pre-natal consultancy is important for women living with HIV to prevent mother-to-child transmissions. — VNS Photo Thu Hien CAN THO ( CAN THO ( VNS )— Sitting alone on a bench outside the Obstetrics Department of Thot Not District General Hospital in southern Can Tho City, the round and sun-bronzed face of a young woman betrays a gnawing anxiety. Her eyes sometimes flit down to her soil-filled finger nails which cling tightly to the bench. Her threadbare hat tumbles to the floor but she does not care about picking it up. She seems to be on the brink of a life-changing event. As department deputy head Nguyen Ngoc Diem Uyens door opens, the woman rushes towards it. Dr Uyen hands her a result paper and says: ""The results of the HIV PCR test show that despite being exposed to HIV, your baby has not contracted the disease. Go home and celebrate this huge slice of luck."" The troubled woman, 27-year-old Nguyen Le Chin (not her real name), is one of more than 12,760 pregnant females in the city who have been tested for HIV this year. Furthermore, she is one of the 24 unfortunate women found to be HIV positive by these tests. Fortunately, she was provided with expert consultancy and treatment to prevent the virus from being transmitted to her unborn child. Lai Kim Anh, director of the citys HIV/AIDS Combat and Prevention Centre says these tested cases account for more than 85 per cent of total pregnancies in Can Tho City this year. The mother-to-child transmission prevention project, which started in the city four years ago, has reduced instances of mother-to-child HIV transmission to zero this year, down from nearly 12 per cent in 2008. Meanwhile, the national target programme has set a goal of bringing mother-to-child transmissions under the 5 per cent mark by 2015, she says. If this prevention process was only implemented in obstetrics hospitals, it would be useless, she says. It needs to include early HIV tests at commune-level healthcare clinics, while pregnant women must receive regular health checks and vaccinations. Chins story Having pottered about the paddy fields tending ducks since she was small, Chin had never gone to school or even left her village. When she was 24 years old, she was introduced to a man and told that he would become her husband. ""I did not have any feelings for him. I merely accepted because the matchmaker told me he was kind and trustful."" Chin soon fell pregant, but it took the young girl three months to realise. She says during her first pregnancy check, the doctor at her communes health clinic extracted some of her blood to detect whether she had any serious diseases. ""At that time, I laughed because I was so strong that no disease could possibly exist in my body."" However, one week later, she was asked to come back by the doctor and was then told she had contracted HIV. He instructed her to go to the districts general hospital for more checks and a consultancy next day. ""I did not know what HIV was but one person in my village had died of it. So, I knew it must be a terrible killer and feared that my foetus would suffer the same fate as me. I was also scared that I would transmit the virus to others if I had any interaction with them."" Chin was deeply saddened but shed no tears. ""It seems a life with paddy fields and ducks has made me unable to express my feelings."" She kept quiet about her disease because people in her village and family were scared of the virus. She wandered around the field for a whole day and agonised about whether to have an abortion. But everything changed for the better when she met Dr Uyen at the district hospital and she was soon undergoing treatment. Dr Uyen says like other pregnant women who are HIV positive, Chin was asked to take AZT (also called Zidovudine or ZDV), a kind of anti-retroviral medicine taken at 14 to 34 weeks of pregnancy, to lower her viral load (the amount of HIV in her blood). ""When her viral load is very low, it is less likely that she will pass HIV to her baby, so this is her best chance."" Dr Uyen was Chins only companion during her hour of need. Even her husband, the only person she told about the disease, failed to show any care. ""He coldly told me that the worst consequence was death, so there was nothing to worry about and that he was too busy to visit me,"" she said. Chin asked him several times to take a HIV test but ""he refused and said he did not believe doctors, their stupid drugs and even the disease they were talking about."" ""He acted as if it was nothing to do with him. I have spent my life in the fields with ducks, so there is no way I could contract this disease. It is him that brought this terrible affliction to me."" Lucky baby When she was going into labour, Chin also got some ARVs to reduce the risk of infecting her baby during the process. Chins baby was born weighing 2.9kg and received special safety and hygiene measures for the first four weeks of her life to counteract exposure to the virus during labour. She is growing up as all babies do and receives regular health checks. She will also be provided with free milk until she is 18-month-old - babies can be infected through breastfeeding so Chin was asked to bottle feed her baby only. And much to Chins relief, the four-week-old baby has undergone a HIV PCR test indicating she is free of the virus. Dr Uyen says: ""The PCR test is very important. It can tell to 98 per cent certainty whether or not a baby who is HIV-exposed has contracted HIV."" Chins baby is a lucky case as she was treated from an early stage. According to Bui Duc Duong, deputy director of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, in many localities, the number of pregnant women getting HIV tests and consultancy falls between just 6-30 per cent of total pregnancies. The statistics show that without proper treatment, the risk of a baby contracting HIV from their infected mother is between 35-40 per cent. This means more than 1,820 babies will contract HIV every year in Viet Nam. Meanwhile, Chin is looking forward to when her child is 18 months old and will undergo the second test which tells with certainty whether her baby is in the clear. Chin is still using ARVs as usual and suffers no side-effects. When she suffers headaches or sickness, Dr Uyen is always her first port of call. Now, despite earning just VND60,000 (US$2.5) each day, Chin has started saving money for when her daughter goes to school. She holds a strong belief that she will live as long as HIV-free people so long as she uses ARVs according to the doctors advice. ""Like ducks, which have to wade through water to follow their flocks although they are sick, I and my child can survive in spite of our difficulties."" — VNS",Sunday,"['targets', 'baby', 'told', 'women', 'hiv', 'disease', 'chin', 'test', 'prevention', 'cent', 'uyen', 'pregnant']","Pre-natal consultancy is important for women living with HIV to prevent mother-to-child transmissions.

The total number of people with HIV in the country was 219,163 as of June, with 67,557 others having full-blown AIDS. Though new HIV and AIDS incidence as well as the number of deaths have reduced since 2007, there is a fear that if the funding is not adequate to maintain preventive activities, the incidence could rise again, she said. An upward trend is already seen in the south-eastern and northern mountainous regions, she said. Also bucking the trend of falling incidence is the 30-39 age group, which has been contracting HIV at an increasing rate since 2002. Only one a third of the people with HIV in the country have received treatment so far. Nguyen Van Cuong, deputy head of the Tay Ninh Province Department of Health, said the Government should increase allocation for HIV prevention since many provinces and cities lack resources and thus push the issue to the back burner. — VNS",Society,"['total', 'project', 'calls', 'incidence', 'hiv', 'approval', 'hivaids', 'prevention', 'cities', 'number', 'trend', 'official', 'provinces', 'country']","The total number of people with HIV in the country was 219,163 as of June, with 67,557 others having full-blown AIDS.

Combined treatment lifts TB/HIV patient burdens,"A pilot programme of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to combine tuberculosis and HIV treatments for TB/HIV co-infected patients in medical centres at district and commune levels have yielded positive results, experts said.",[],2017-06-21,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI – A Ministry of Health (MoH) pilot programme to combine tuberculosis and HIV treatments for TB/HIV co-infected patients in medical centres at district and commune levels has yielded positive results, experts said. The programme was first implemented from 2013 to 2015 in Nho Quan District (Ninh Bình Province) and Hưng Hà District (Thái Bình Province). It was then expanded to 12 provinces in 2015-2016. The programme aims to reduce the burdens for TB/HIV co-infected patients, caused by separated treatment systems for the two diseases which are common at most medical establishments in the country. According to Associate Professor Bùi Đức Dương, deputy director of MoH’s Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, TB is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients and is thus the leading cause of HIV death. Every year, Việt Nam has about 5,500 new cases of TB/HIV co-infected patients. However, an absence of a combined TB/HIV treatment system has forced many patients to go back and forth between different medical establishments at the same time for diagnosis and treatment. For example, a TB-infected patient will be introduced to a HIV/AIDS-treated centre for test and possible treatment (in case they are HIV positive). On the contrary, a HIV/AIDS patient who is suspicious of having TB will be advised to go to a TB-treated centre. Many patients, already feeling disgraced and hopeless about their situation, end up quitting the treatment process due to exhaustion. The pilot programme has solved this problem, said Dr Nguyễn Văn Cử of Central Lung Hospital. According to the preliminary results from the 12 provinces implementing the pilot programme, the proactive detection of tuberculosis infection in HIV patients as well as the detection of HIV infection in TB patients has markedly improved. Now, patients can be diagnosed for both infections the first time they go to a medical centre, instead of at least three times as before. The programme has also increased the number of TB and HIV/AIDS co-infected patients simultaneously receiving treatment for both diseases. “The number of patients quitting treatment process has reduced, while doctors are informed of both TB-treatment and HIV-treatment processes,” Cử said. The combined model has also helped reduce medical personnel, facility cost and other investment costs needed to offer TB and HIV/AIDS treatment services, said Assoc Prof and Dr Lê Văn Hợi, deputy director of Central Lung Hospital. Besides, the quality of medical services has improved, especially in disease detection and early treatment. Due to the effectiveness of the model, the Ministry of Health is ready to expand the programme to a national scale over the next few years, according to Hợi. Several related legislative documents and technical instructions have been promulgated to prepare for the rollout, including the Framework for combination of TB and HIV treatment in 2016-2020 and other documents on health insurance schemes for HIV and TB patients. – VNS",Society,"['pilot', 'patient', 'medical', 'patients', 'combined', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'coinfected', 'tb', 'programme', 'burdens', 'lifts', 'treatment', 'tbhiv']","The programme aims to reduce the burdens for TB/HIV co-infected patients, caused by separated treatment systems for the two diseases which are common at most medical establishments in the country.

Infants with HIV face bleak future,"Many infants infected with HIV become orphans not long after birth either because their parents die from AIDS or because they are abandoned, a sad beginning to a short life.",[],2005-12-20,vietnamnews.vn,"Infants with HIV face bleak future (20-12-2005) HA NOI — Many infants infected with HIV become orphans not long after birth either because their parents die from AIDS or because they are abandoned, a sad beginning to a short life. Holding her 14 month-old niece Ngoc Huyen in her arms, Huong wipes away tears. ""She was diagnosed as being infected by HIV only last week, and has been ill since then,"" she says, as the infant shudders and cries convulsively. Huyen’s father had been working far from home, and had sexual relations with other women while he was away. He was later diagnosed as having HIV/AIDS. Chief nurse of the Central Paediatric Hospital’s Infectious Diseases wing, Nguyen Thi Bich Nhat, says nearly 100 children afflicted with HIV/AIDS have been admitted to the hospital for treatment this year, many in critical condition suffering from respiratory failure. Many of the children were being cared for by their grandparents, because their parents had already died from illnesses related to HIV/AIDS. Last month two more children died at the hospital, she said. Baby Huyen is now receiving treatment as an inpatient, suffering from severe pneumonia. The Central Obstetric and Gynaecology Hospital is seeing more and more infected babies whose lives will be counted in days. Nurse Nguyen Thi Hoa holds a new born. ""Poor child. Her mother was hospitalised with ulcers covering her whole body. After giving birth, she was rushed home to die without seeing her daughter."" Hoa says the family have not returned to the hospital or phoned about the baby. ""I am not sure if they will come back to pick her up,"" she says. Another infected baby receiving treatment at the hospital has not yet seen her parents. Her mother is infected with HIV/AIDS. ""I do not know if her family is somehow afraid of catching the disease or are discouraged, but they have abandoned the baby to be cared for by our nurses and doctors ,"" Hoa says. Doctor Pham Van Mai, head of paediatrics at the hospital, says the number of infected children admitted this year was higher than in the previous year. His wing received 67 new born babies infected with HIV from their mothers. He says in the past, babies were usually infected by intravenous-drug-using fathers or mothers who were sex workers. However, he says, now they are finding some parents are civil servants or from other backgrounds. One of three infected children receiving treatment at the hospital is the daughter of an accountant and an engineer. Since their daughter was found to have been infected from her mother, the father has been severely depressed. He is too scared to bring their other children for a HIV test, and says he would commit suicide if another child was also found to be infected. His wife’s infection is developing into full-blown AIDS. Health workers at the hospital say they weren’t sure if this man was busy taking care of his wife, but that he has not yet come back to collect their daughter. As the number of children infected with HIV/AIDS increases, paediatric healthcare workers are getting busier. Nurses immediately bathe new borns, hoping the quick cleansing of lochia will prevent HIV infection.

The supply of ARV drugs funded by international donors is expected to be used up by the end of next year, said Nguyễn Hữu Hưng, deputy director of the city’s Department of Health. Health insurance will have to cover the cost of ARV drugs starting in early 2019, Hưng said at a conference held on Wednesday in HCM City. The city’s Department of Health has told medical centres in all districts to establish general clinics to provide health examinations and treatment for insured HIV patients. However, medical centres in several districts are ineligible to establish general clinics because of a lack of specialised doctors and medical equipment. Phạm Thị Kim Hoa, director of Cần Giờ District’s Medical Centre, said that its public health consulting and support department had long been responsible for providing free health check-ups and treatment for HIV patients. The public health consulting and support department, however, is not eligible to sign contracts with social insurance agencies to provide health check-ups and treatment for insured HIV patients. Therefore, the centre has to set up a general clinic which has legal rights to sign contracts with social insurance agencies, according to Hoa. The centre said it had sought approval for setting up a general clinic, but it was refused because of it lacked specialised doctors, she said. It plans to transfer treatment of 112 patients to Cần Giờ Hospital by the second quarter of next year. District 1’s Medical Centre is in the same situation as it is struggling to set up a general clinic to provide health care services for HIV patients with insurance cards, said Nguyễn Văn Thể, director of the centre. Lack of medical equipment and doctors, among other reasons, have made it impossible for the centre to establish a general clinic, according to Thể. Around 1,200 HIV patients are being treated at District 1’s Medical Centre, he said. Tiêu Thị Thu Vân, director of the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, has proposed setting up HIV-treatment clinics at district-level hospitals instead of general clinics at medical centres.

New research points to possible cure and end of AIDS epidemic by 2030,"New research in the treatment of AIDS has pointed to a possible cure, which could lead to the UN’s goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030.",[],2016-10-22,vietnamnews.vn,"Gia Lộc CHICAGO — New research in the treatment of AIDS has pointed to a possible cure, which could lead to the UN’s goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. Research in human immunology, genomics, virology and structural biology has raised expectations for a successful vaccine strategy that could be an effective cure. Results of the research are being discussed at the biennial HIV Research for Prevention (HIVR4P) conference in Chicago from October 17-21. More than 1,400 delegates from 41 countries are attending the event. According to USAID, the AIDS pandemic continues to be a major global health issue. Although treatment rates have doubled in the past five years, the number of annual new infections with HIV has not decreased substantially. In 2015, HIV infected more than two million people and killed more than one million around the world. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most severely affected with 25 million adults and children living with HIV. Recent modeling results show that even in the face of the massively expanded use of current treatment and prevention options, hundreds of thousands of people in low- and middle-income countries will be newly infected with HIV and die from AIDS for decades to come. Given the scope of the epidemic, new biomedical tools to prevent HIV are essential, according to USAID. An effective, well-adopted vaccine could prevent the majority of new annual HIV infections, thereby averting millions of infections and savings countless lives. Professor Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina in the US, said the next 15 years would provide the field with opportunities for developing an array of HIV prevention tools, including the possible use of antibodies for HIV prevention, and the development of HIV vaccines based on an understanding of the mechanisms of action of the antibodies. HIV prevention research is “on the move”, Cohen said, adding that ongoing studies would inform implementation of treatment for prevention and maximise benefits. “Long-acting antiviral agents will serve as critical new tools for treatment and prevention of HIV,” he said, adding that ultimately new tools will lead to improve combination prevention of HIV. HIVR4P co-chair Lynn Morris of South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said: “Vaccine research is embarking on two large clinical trials to test the ability of different types of antibodies to prevent HIV infection.” “We also have a vigorous pipeline of new vaccine concepts and products, along with a more focused plan for getting them tested in humans much more quickly than ever before,” she added. Another HIVR4P co-chair, Nelly Mugo of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, said that a global movement to crush the epidemic in women and girls required looking at HIV prevention technologies, implementation and behaviour issues together. “Today we have new options in female-controlled HIV prevention such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and, perhaps soon, (dapivirine vaginal) rings. One of our biggest remaining challenges, and one that we expect to hear a lot about at the conference, is understanding how to make these new tools available to women and girls, and how to support them to use these tools and stay safe.” Jeanne Marrazzo of the University of Alabama in Birmingham (US), who is also one of the HIVR4P co-chairs, said the field was realising that choice and flexibility were key to HIV prevention and to new options that can enhance both reproductive health and HIV and sexually transmitted infection prevention. “Increasing access and adherence is also dependent on engaging potential users early and often, as new prevention products are developed and tested, to better understanding and address what they want and need to remain HIV-free,” she said. Another HIVR4P co-chair, Thomas Hope of Northwestern University (US), said the conference supported collaboration and partnerships between researchers, advocates, scientists and policymakers focusing on vaccines, microbicides and other forms of prevention. Such collaboration could lead to better, faster and more comprehensive responses to the epidemic, he said. Interventions for adolescents Dr Chewe Luo, associate director and programme division chief of HIV/AIDS Section at UNICEF, said that new HIV infections had declined rapidly among children aged zero to 14, but more slowly among adolescents aged 15 to 19 and young adults aged 20 to 24. According to analysis of UNAIDS 2015 HIV and AIDS released in June, it was estimated that 1.8 million adolescents were living with HIV globally, including 80 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. “We have to need improve targeting and planning for effective combinations of prevention packages,” she said. Ending AIDS in adolescents is an important contribution to ending AIDS by 2030 and ensuring broader sustainable development goals of ensuring health and well-being for all, at every stage of life, she said. A differentiated and targeted approach is required for adolescents, and service packages must be cross-sectorial for adolescents, she added. For instance, a combination HIV-prevention package for people who inject drugs includes HIV-test services and antiretroviral therapy; a condom lubricant programme; information on communication, empowerment, laws and rights of people who inject drugs; and clinical services, opoid-substitution therapy and needle-syringe exchange programmes. This package is part of the UNAIDS’s fast-tracking combination prevention toward reducing new HIV infections to fewer than 500.000 by 2020. Moreover, technology should be used in HIV intervention with adolescents, she said. For example, the U-report, an interactive mobile phone and SMS-based programme, has been used to provide confidential counselling via SMS and chatting with adolescents in Zambia. Currently, there are 2.1 million U-Reporters across the globe. “We know that smarter investments targeted at biomedical, behavioural and structural interventions will decrease the number of new infections,” she said. Susan Rosenthal of Columbia University (US) said that those who provide HIV intervention and other services to adolescents should have a better understanding of the implications of psychological development and decision-making. Additional time should be built into clinic scheduling for counseling, she said. More funds needed A new report released at the second HIV Research for Prevention Conference documented 2015 funding, highlighting a decade of flat funding and its potential impact on continued innovation in the HIV-prevention research and development (R&D) field. The Resource Tracking for HIV Prevention R&D Working Group’s 12th annual report with the title of HIV Prevention Research & Development Investments, and 2000-2015 Investment priorities to fund innovation in a challenging global health landscape, finds that funding for R&D of new and emerging prevention options decreased slightly in 2015. This was due in part to decreases from the US public sector and a downswing in global philanthropic funding. In 2015, funders invested a total of US $1.20 billion across R&D, down from US $1.25 billion in 2014, across eight key areas: preventive AIDS vaccines, microbicides, PrEP using antiretroviral drugs, treatment as prevention, Herpes simplex virus type 2 vaccines and operations research related to voluntary medical male circumcision, female condoms and prevention of vertical transmission. Steady progress in R&D for AIDS vaccines, microbicides, PrEP using antiretroviral drugs and treatment as prevention confirms science’s critical role in providing solutions to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yet research for these badly needed solutions is in danger of being slowed or even sidelined by inadequate funding, according to a press release issued at the conference on September 19. Luiz Loures, deputy executive director of UNAIDS, said that it was critical to scale up investments in HIV-prevention innovations, science and technology “to put us on the Fast-Track to ending AIDS by 2030”. The report also finds that investment is being made in all phases of the research pipeline but remains concentrated among a few large investors. The US public sector (primarily via the National Institutes of Health) remained the largest global contributor at US$850 million, accounting for 70 per cent of total funding. The US government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest philanthropic funder, accounted for 81 per cent of all funding in 2015. A more diverse base of funders would increase the stability of R&D financing and cushion the impact if any of the major funders were to reduce their investments. To improve continuity, the Resource Tracking for HIV Prevention R&D Working Group calls for a more balanced funding base, especially through support of new investment by European and low- and middle-income countries. Mark Feinberg, president and CEO of International ADIS Vaccine Initiative, said there was strong momentum in research and development, and “we need to expedite the development of vaccine strategies and other new, biomedical prevention options that promise to be safe, accessible and effective for use throughout the world”. “There must be adequate and sustained investment at all stages from early laboratory research and to clinical testing if we are to truly be able to contain the HIV pandemic and approach an end to AIDS,” he added. There is great optimism for HIV prevention research. Daily oral PrEP is gaining traction as a new prevention option in an increasing number of countries. An antiretroviral-based microbicide ring that showed modest efficacy earlier in 2016 will be further evaluated to determine its viability as a prevention option for women, and large-scale efficacy trials of an AIDS vaccine candidate and an injectable form of PrEP are slated to begin soon. In addition, a novel proof-of-concept trial of antibody-mediated prevention is underway in several countries. Many more promising candidates in earlier stages are progressing toward pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global advocate for HIV prevention, said that innovative science needed innovative funding. “We need an expanded and more diverse global cadre of funders who will be involved in and dedicated to advancing HIV prevention R&D, including product delivery,” he said. “And these investments need to ensure that new options like daily oral PrEP, and potentially the dapivirine vaginal ring, do not sit on the shelf unused because we don’t know how to effectively deliver them, and that future R&D better meets the needs and wants of those for whom the products are developed,” Warren added. — VNS",Society,"['end', '2030', 'adolescents', 'possible', 'rd', 'points', 'hiv', 'cure', 'prevention', 'research', 'aids', 'vaccine', 'development', 'global', 'epidemic', 'treatment']","Gia LộcCHICAGO — New research in the treatment of AIDS has pointed to a possible cure, which could lead to the UN’s goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030.

Workshop addresses health insurance challenges for HIV patients,Health experts discussed ways to tackle barriers and find solutions to provide social health insurance (SHI) to people living with HIV (PLHIV) at a workshop today in HCM City.,[],2016-08-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — Health experts discussed ways to tackle barriers and find solutions to provide social health insurance (SHI) to people living with HIV (PLHIV) at a workshop on Tuesday in HCM City. The event was jointly organised by the Việt Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS with support from the HCM City Provincial AIDS Centre (HCMC PAC) and the US Agency for International Development through its Sustainable Management of the HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical Assistance project implemented by FHI 360. The workshop opened with testimonials from PLHIV, who revealed the challenges they faced with respect to enrolment in SHI to obtain coverage for HIV treatment. At the event, participants debated ways to overcome the challenges and to mobilise PLHIV to enroll in social health insurance. The workshop kicked off a series of events that focused on SHI access and utilisation among PLHIV that will culminate in a “Red Ribbon” event at the end of the year. Representatives of the PLHIV community identified the cost of enrolling their families in social health insurance, the lack of a registered permanent residence and identity cards and the fear of disclosure of their HIV status as key barriers to SHI enrollment. “The HCMC PAC will put all its effort to sustain 30,000 HIV patients currently undergoing HIV antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. We will work closely with the Vietnam Social Security to mobilize resources and overcome the barriers to enrollment,” said Doctor Văn Hùng, head of Treatment Management Department, HCM PAC. “The lessons learned from HCMC can be shared with other provinces encountering similar situations,” Hùng added. According to HCMC PAC statistics, as of June 2016, only 10,544 PLHIV, or 36 per cent of all ARV patients, in HCMC have health insurance cards. Moreover, just over a third of those PLHIV who have health insurance cards have used them to obtain HIV services. One out of every three Vietnamese HIV patients lives in HCM City. ARV drugs are an effective solution to safeguard the health of people living with HIV and to protect communities from the spread of the epidemic, as ARV treatment can reduce viral loads to negligible levels. According to the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control’s statistics, up till the end of June, there were over 110,000 patients being treated with ARV drugs nationwide. Until now, ARV treatment has been made available free of charge due to international donor support. However, with Việt Nam emerging as a “middle income developing country,” donors have begun phasing out assistance, mandating SHI to cover and sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services. The Government of Việt Nam aims to enroll at least 80 per cent of all people in social health insurance by 2020. — VNS",Society,"['challenges', 'social', 'shi', 'arv', 'patients', 'hcm', 'workshop', 'hiv', 'addresses', 'hcmc', 'plhiv', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","HCM CITY — Health experts discussed ways to tackle barriers and find solutions to provide social health insurance (SHI) to people living with HIV (PLHIV) at a workshop on Tuesday in HCM City.

Hope for elderly victims of HIV,"Cam Giang spends time with a special club in Vinh Tuy Ward, where old folks infected with HIV get a new lease on life through vocational training and activities such as baloon folding.",[],2008-07-20,vietnamnews.vn,"Living healthy: Members of 67 clubs for the elderly also benefit from monthly health checks and chances to increase their understanding of HIV/AIDS and self-care under the support of HelpAge International and Viet Nam Women’s Union. — VNS Photo Viet Thanh New tricks: These three members of Vinh Tuy Club are among 2,110 old women given loans during the past two years. Two hearts beat as one: From the first lessons of making dolls and balloon animals by Quyen Tran (right), Bich Thuy (left) has brought his ideas into reality and taught people in over a dozen clubs to make balloons and fabric dolls. Cam Giang spends time with a special club in Vinh Tuy Ward, where old folks infected with HIV get a new lease on life through vocational training and activities such as baloon folding. Standing on the path that surrounds Hoan Kiem Lake, 51-year old Ninh Thi Hong feels anxious, dressed in her clown costume, carrying a handful of colourful balloons. Trying to ignore the curious stares of those around her, Hong smiles at the children that start to gather around. Her warmth is soon repaid, as a few minutes later she finds herself surrounded by a crowd as she hastily inflates new balloons, having already sold her first bundle. A rainbow of different colours and shapes, Hong’s balloons are different than those usually found in that area, as they had been brought over from the US. Along with those extraordinary balloons, Hong herself is not your average balloon seller. She is the vice president of a special club that caters to the elderly affected by HIV/AIDS in Vinh Tuy Ward. Like a ""kindergarten"" It’s a rainy night as Vinh Tuy’s People’s Committee opens its door as it usually does on the 14th day of every month. Outside, the street leading to the committee is crowded with the signs of construction, numerous sand dunes and pot-holes, making the way that much more treacherous in the rain. Despite these conditions, many elderly people can be seen making their way through the entrance. Today is the monthly meeting for all the elderly in Hong’s club. It’s 7.30pm, and nearly 50 elderly women gather in the meeting room. While most of the seats have been taken, the ladies continue to crowd into the room. The rain falls outside, but its sound is drowned by the chatter, laughter and the ""pop"" of exploding balloons inside the room. These signs of joys make it hard to imagine the tragedies this group of women share. ""Keep it like this, and twist it into a tree trunk,"" says Hong, as she stands in the centre of the room, raising a long green balloon above her head. It has been five months since Hong sold balloons that first day at Hoan Kiem Lake. It was an experiment, and it was a success. More and more people are now following the path she started paving that day. The members of the club are following her balloon lesson, diligently trying to twist the green balloons into tree trunks. The crowd bursts into laughter after a balloon accidentally pops. ""We spend around VND500 for five balloons to make a complete animal, but we can sell it for VND5,000, so we make money quickly,"" says Hong. ""The work is realistic. It takes only half a day for members to learn how to turn balloons into various animals,"" says Tran Bich Thuy, a project officer at Viet Nam Women’s Union, which provides direct support to the club. ""For the elderly who don’t have much time left, half a day is ideal to learn a new skill, particularly when this work can help them earn money rather easily."" The secret, Thuy and Hong reveal, is where the balloons come from. They are purchased abroad and brought to Viet Nam by Quyen Tran, a regional programme manager at HelpAge International. When they first started the program, an expert from Thailand was brought in to teach the group how to make balloon animals. ""The balloons can be folded into many things, depending on the creativeness of the sellers,"" says Hong. ""You can even spell out ‘Viet Nam’ to put on the heads of Vietnamese football fans,"" Thuy adds. Nguyen Thi Mua, a 64-year-old woman, is folding a balloon with her six-year-old granddaughter. One of Mua’s sons is in prison, while her other son is now at a rehabilitation centre. ""I haven’t missed a meeting since this club was established two years ago. We keep coming back not only because of the club’s vocational training lessons, but also its joyful atmosphere. Together, we escape from the sad stories of real life to engage in doing new things. It’s like a kindergarten for us,"" Mua smiles. Loans for the elderly The club at Vinh Tuy Ward is just one of 67 groups for elderly persons affected by HIV/AIDS in Ha Noi, Nam Dinh, Thai Nguyen and Quang Ninh provinces. Over the past two years, all these clubs have joined a new project named VIE011 (Community Mechanisms for Mitigating the Impact of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam), which aims to help improve the health and livelihoods of elderly living in challenging circumstances. Implemented by HelpAge International and Viet Nam Women’s Union, the project covers many activities. What distinguishes it from similar projects are the loans available to older women, many of whom wouldn’t qualify for loans under the Viet Nam Bank for Social Policies, the bank dedicated to helping socially disadvantaged people. ""Frankly, a bank is still a business, and this means that finances are always the top priority. It is commonly frowned upon to provide loans to an old woman. If a woman is over the working age and has children addicted to drugs or infected with HIV/AIDS, how can she be trusted to repay her loan?"" says Thuy. Project VIE011 not only provides loans to elderly persons affected by HIV/AIDS, but also provides them with training so that they can earn money and repay those loans. Other than encouraging people to run small businesses, like raising chickens, fish or pigs, or opening small restaurants or tea stalls, the project also teaches people new ways to earn money, such as selling balloons or making fabric dolls. On top of working as a regional programme manager at HelpAge International, Quyen Tran, a Vietnamese American, is also a teacher, helping these old women start fresh with new skills. Initiated by Quyen, the idea came to him when he realised that many old people were afraid to take out loans because they didn’t know how to pay them back. Working in Thailand for the past five years, Quyen saw that the Thai government had a policy of ""100 jobs for people"", finding employment for anyone willing to work. He wanted to copy that model in Viet Nam. To bring that model over, Quyen filled his suitcase with American-made balloons, catalogues of dolls from Thailand and other hand-made toys, as well as the necessary materials to make them. As he landed in Viet Nam, project VIE011 took flight. Following the success of the balloon animal business, the next doll-making scheme was implemented seven months ago, and has so far proven just as successful. Under Quyen’s guidance, seven members from another club for the elderly have completed hundreds of dolls. While their needle work may require a little more practice, the dolls are attractive enough to generate orders from some Vietnamese businesses, expatriates in Viet Nam and even officers from the Italian Embassy. Realising the potential of hand-made products, and Thuy’s continued support, Quyen has now spent some of his own money on yet another do-it-yourself business scheme: teaching the elderly to make embroidered hats. Opening a catalogue displaying an endless selection of hand-made items, Quyen confides, ""I believe that there are a hundred simple things that we can make by hand, and children’s toys is still an untapped market. If we can learn these jobs successfully, we have a chance to provide jobs for hundreds of labourers, including the elderly and their HIV/AIDS infected children."" Where is our future? It is a shared belief that the best place to care for HIV/AIDS victims is at home with their family. Any programme aiming to help these groups, then, must keep this basic principal in mind. For the elderly who live with, or are HIV/AIDS victims, the burden on their shoulders is often tripled. Apart from taking care of their infected children, they often become the primary caregiver to their sometimes infected grandchildren. At a time in their lives when they should be looked after by society or by their own children, they are still looking after themselves, finding no time to rest in their old age. Thuy, the project officer, says that the situation in Viet Nam is becoming worse as HIV/AIDS is now so often linked to drug addiction. Many families of HIV/AIDS victims lose everything they have to drugs. The elderly can often be the most affected, scraping by as they try to feed their HIV/AIDS infected children. Even when their children pass away, they are still left to the mercy of society, as their children leave nothing behind but their bodies. ""Although 100 per cent of the elderly questioned ask nothing for themselves, only their children, it doesn’t mean they aren’t in need. So far, there is no project except VIE011 providing loans or work opportunities for these people. In most cases, only the HIV/AIDS victims or their children receive financial support,"" Thuy says. The VE011 project has often been the only avenue these women have to turn to, and has so far provided 2,110 loans to elderly women over the past two years. ""Giving loans to the elderly is not as risky as is commonly thought. On the contrary, elderly women have proven to be safe borrowers. Under our project, 100 per cent of people have given their loans back before the deadline,"" Thuy reveals. According to Quyen, older people are usually responsible in the way they invest their loans. If they don’t know how to invest it, then they won’t take the loan. ""It’s important that we help them find ways to earn money, whether they have the loans or not,"" Quyen says. As he continues to teach people to make and sell crafts, he has many more tricks up his sleeve to help these disadvantaged families. ""After the initial project, it will be difficult to get the members steady work at doll or embroidery clubs. We’ll need the help of businesses to ensure output,"" says Thuy. ""We don’t need another volunteer, but a real enterprise interested in our product so that we can expand."" As the group looks for an enterprise to bring their small project to the larger scale, the women will continue to gather at their scattered club locations. Sharing a laugh while learning a new skill, the women escape their hardships just for a day, on a path that will hopefully lead them to a brighter place in life. — VNS",Sunday,"['balloons', 'project', 'women', 'club', 'nam', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'hope', 'viet', 'quyen', 'loans', 'victims', 'elderly']","It’s 7.30pm, and nearly 50 elderly women gather in the meeting room.

"Learning English empowers people living with, affected by, HIV/AIDS","English study may be regarded as a luxury for people living with HIV/AIDS, but 35-year-old Kim Thi Hau says it has invigorated her struggle for a brighter future.",[],2005-11-24,vietnamnews.vn,"Learning English empowers people living with, affected by, HIV/AIDS (24-11-2005) by Van Anh A UNV English tutor teaching a group of doctors and nurses who work with people living with HIV/AIDS.—UNV/VNS Photo Philipp Essl HAI PHONG — English study may be regarded as a luxury for people living with HIV/AIDS, but 35-year-old Kim Thi Hau says it has invigorated her struggle for a brighter future. There are many reasons for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to study English. ""Proficiency in English enables me to understand labels and instructions on ARV [anti-retroviral] medication by myself,"" she said, revealing the immediate, practical side for people in her situation. ""I was infected by my intravenous drug-addicted husband, but my four-year old son is free from the disease, so I need to live for him now,"" she said. Hau is a member of Hai Phong’s Hoa Phuong Do self-help group, and studies under the English Tutoring Scheme conducted by the United Nations Volunteer (UNV) organisation in Viet Nam. Launched last year, the tutoring scheme works with people living with HIV/AIDS, and those affected by the disease, including families, doctors, nurses, social workers and public healthcare officials. Some students say the benefits go beyond simply learning a new language. Hau said that while studying English and speaking to PLWHA, her ability to communicate with people in Vietnamese also improved, and felt she could better empathize with others. ""I’ve become much closer to people who are seriously ill and will die soon."" The volunteer tutoring programme operates in Ha Noi and Hai Phong with ongoing support from 12-15 national and international volunteers, and around 80 students have so far benefited from the programme. Building confidence ""Proficiency in English helps PLWHA strengthen their self-confidence by overcoming the psychological barrier of talking to foreigners,"" said the manager of the UNV English Tutoring Scheme for PLWHA, Philipp Essl. He explained that many programme participants faced stigmatization and discrimination, and the English Tutoring programme, part of the Greater Involvement for People Living with HIV Project, was designed to help people overcome both these issues. Although not HIV positive, one young student joined the Hoa Phuong Do English classes as an HIV/AIDS activist to work with the self-help group. ""PLWHA are just like me and you. Discrimination against them is unfair,"" she said. ""I want to help these women spread information about HIV/AIDS prevention to the community."" Her all-woman group has 8 key members, and about 50 regular supporters. They take care of each other when they are ill, and help families when members die of AIDS-related diseases. Tonia Timperley, a Canadian Viet kieu (overseas Vietnamese) UNV English tutor in Ha Noi, said she encourages students to at least appear confident when they speak English, which then translates into actual self-confidence. Timperley, who teaches doctors and nurses working with PLWHA at the Dong Da District Health Centre said her students were driven by a strong motivation to help others, and worked very hard to overcome the challenges of learning a new language. Approaching donors Pham Thanh Van, a UNV English tutor working with the Hoa Phuong Do group in Hai Phong, said the programme raised the profile of HIV/AIDS awareness activities conducted by the group. Members now had more opportunities to communicate with donor groups, including international non-governmental organisations. ""By speaking English they can approach donation sources for funds to finance their activities, and have access to the latest information on medication, treatment, and HIV/AIDS prevention. In this way they become effective sources of information for the community."" Van explained that despite the sad reality that many students are conscious that they might not live long enough to speak English proficiently, they strongly encourage other PLWHA to join the classes. Essl said demand for new classes was very high, and that he was working on strengthening their organizational capacity in order to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the programme. He said extending the scheme was vital, but that it depended on finding sources of funding. Building leadership Essl said the English tutoring scheme was especially important for people in leadership positions representing the HIV/AIDS community. He said that because these people are particularly exposed to the international community, they had an extra incentive to improve their English ability. ""We focus on that by offering intensive one-on-one tutoring to PLWHA in community leadership positions, such as leaders of self-help groups,"" he said. Essl said the scheme was part of an overall plan to empower people at the grassroots level to be community leaders affecting real social change. He said the leadership focus is also true for people who work with people who are HIV positive. Staff from numerous self-help groups, local and international NGOs and local health centres also benefit from the programme. Pham Thi Hue, 25, founder of the Hoa Phuong Do group is one community leader benefiting from the scheme. ""As the group’s leader, I meet and communicate with international supporters, including donor organisations. I found not being able to speak English well previously held me back,"" she said. The strong positive attitude and inspiring spirit of the students motivates the volunteer teachers to continue their work. As Hoa Phuong Do class member Hau said, ""Even though I may not live a long life, learning English will definitely help me.""",Society,"['plwha', 'english', 'affected', 'living', 'scheme', 'students', 'empowers', 'hivaids', 'group', 'unv', 'learning', 'tutoring', 'programme']","Learning English empowers people living with, affected by, HIV/AIDS(24-11-2005)by Van AnhA UNV English tutor teaching a group of doctors and nurses who work with people living with HIV/AIDS.—UNV/VNS Photo Philipp EsslHAI PHONG — English study may be regarded as a luxury for people living with HIV/AIDS, but 35-year-old Kim Thi Hau says it has invigorated her struggle for a brighter future.

High-risk groups fail to heed HIV advice,"After five years, a nationwide campaign of harm reduction and HIV prevention among sex workers has not proven effective, a review conference heard yesterday.",[],2011-04-28,vietnamnews.vn,"Fishermen receive leaflets on HIV/AIDS prevention during a communication programme in Dong Hai Ward, Hai An District, Hai Phong City.—VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc. HCM CITY — After five years, a nationwide campaign of harm reduction and HIV prevention among sex workers has not proven effective, a review conference heard yesterday. Health officials said several programmes have been carried out to protect sex workers from HIV and other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), but these have suffered from many problems including a lack of co-ordination between agencies fighting HIV/AIDS. Nguyen Trong Dam, deputy Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said prostitutes were among the population groups most vulnerable to HIV infections in Viet Nam, besides intravenous drug users. The situation has become more and more serious, Dam said. He said despite the implementation of several awareness programmes, condom use among sex workers, including males, was very low. He said stronger co-ordination was needed between public security forces, health agencies and the labour sector to help sex workers remain safe from diseases like HIV/AIDS and also facilitate their reintegration into the community after rehabilitation. ""A few years ago, it was easy to see female sex workers in public places like bus stations and pavements, but most of the now go online or adopt more sophisticated forms of services,"" Dam said. Prostitution has become one of the main causes of HIV transmission, health workers said. According to recent statistics, the rate of HIV infections among sex workers was pretty high in major cities, 20 per cent in Ha Noi, 23 per cent in Hai Phong and 16 per cent in HCM City. HIV infection among sex workers was as high as 30 per cent, the conference heard. Duong Van Dat, an officer with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA, said very few sex workers were able to access HIV prevention services like free condoms and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. This situation had to change drastically, he added. Dat noted that the Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, had recently said that it was not possible to get rid of prostitution totally and that intensified focus was necessary on harm reduction among sex workers. He said that in Cambodia, up to 80 per cent of the sex workers were using condoms and the incidence of HIV and other STDs had fallen sharply. In Viet Nam, there was a large number of sex workers who dont use condoms because they cannot access it, he added. Condoms were not easily available in public places in Viet Nam like hotels, and there were cultural barriers that prevented both the sex workers as well as their clients from purchasing them, he said. According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention Department under the Health Ministry, as of September 30, 2010, the country had 180,312 HIV positive people, 42,339 AIDS patients and 48,368 people had died of AIDS. The epidemic has spread widely with HIV populations in all provinces, 97 per cent of the districts and 70 per cent of communes nation-wide, department officials said. Eighty per cent of the HIV positive population in Viet Nam were males, they added. Dr Nguyen Minh Tam of the department said the rate of HIV transmission was particularly high among males who had sex with males (MSM). She cited a survey in 2009 that found just 47.4 per cent of the MSM population in HCM City used condoms regularly with their partners. The rate was higher in Ha Noi and Hai Phong. The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs said at the conference that it would expand the programme for harm reduction and STD prevention among sex workers in the country over the next five years. It said it was important to improve the knowledge and awareness among local governments of the crucial importance of providing free condoms, especially to high-risk populations. Local officials with low awareness have made it very difficult to promote the use of condoms, ministry officials told the conference.",Society,"['fail', 'advice', 'hiv', 'heed', 'officials', 'viet', 'highrisk', 'population', 'cent', 'prevention', 'condoms', 'groups', 'workers', 'sex', 'hai']","Fishermen receive leaflets on HIV/AIDS prevention during a communication programme in Dong Hai Ward, Hai An District, Hai Phong City.—VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc.

This was revealed by director of the health ministrys Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Nguyen Hoang Long at a meeting last week in the central province of Thua Thien-Hue. The meeting, which was attended by experts from the Ministry of Health and departments of health from 63 provinces and cities, summed up HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures during the first six months of this year and set up plan for the remaining months. The country gave Methadone treatment to more than 31,000 patients and administered antiretroviral (ARV) to nearly 96,000 ones during this period of time. As many as 28 out of 63 provinces and cities have approved a plan to ensure funds for HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures. Long noted that HIV/AIDS preventive measures in the past months saw some limitations as the number of condoms and injection needles delivered free-of-charge decreased compared with the same period last year. Only 38 per cent of the expected number of people received Methadone and 35 provinces and cities did not approve plans for funding HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures. Long has proposed a plan for the last six months of this year, including expanding treatment and prevention services, improving treatment with Methadone and ARV, increasing HIV discovery, and completing a plan for supplying ARV.

The event aims to respond to the national action month for HIV/AIDS prevention and control, and marks World AIDS Day (December 1). Speaking at the event, Deputy Health Minister Nguyễn Thành Long highlighted the significant achievements Việt Nam has made in HIV/AIDS prevention and control over the past 26 years. The year 2016 marked the ninth consecutive year Việt Nam has witnessed a reduction in the number of new HIV infections, cases of HIV developing into full-blown AIDS, and AIDS-related fatalities, Long said. Việt Nam has carried out comprehensive and effective measures to combat HIV/AIDS while focusing on caring for, supporting, and curing people living with HIV/AIDS, he reiterated. Việt Nam has actively responded to the 90-90-90 goals set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UN AIDS), that ensures at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV will know their status, and that 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and 90 percent of all people receiving ARV therapy will be diagnosed with viral suppression. The Deputy Minister called for a drastic and joint effort to combat HIV/AIDS, with focus on early HIV/AIDS screening and testing. Localities should also push forward with efforts to realise the Three-Zero target of no new HIV infections, no death from AIDS, and no discrimination against HIV/AIDS carriers.

In Việt Nam, about 10,000 HIV cases were detected in 2015, down from 18,000 in 2010.",http://vietnamnews.vn/society/346980/da-nang-observes-world-aids-day.html
How VN will control AIDS absent foreign funds,"Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the Ministry of Health’s Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) about plans for HIV/AIDS treatment.",[],2017-03-13,vietnamnews.vn,"Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the Ministry of Health’s Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) about plans for HIV/AIDS treatment. As international donors have halted support for HIV/AIDS treatment in Việt Nam, how will prevention and control be affected? There will certainly be difficulties. Every year, there are about 10,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS carriers in Việt Nam. If we do not have proper and timely intervention, there is a great risk of outbreaks. While other diseases all have vaccines, the only “vaccine” for HIV/AIDS is communications. However, budget for communications is very limited. Meanwhile, condoms, needles and methadone are essential for intervention and prevention. The current methadone source, which is used to replace drugs, is stable for 50,000 users. However, needles and condoms have no supply sources. In the past, 90 per cent of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV/AIDS carriers were provided for free by international donors, especially the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. But such funding has been rapidly cut down, to 40 per cent this year and will end next year. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS has pledged to run until the end of this year. We are working on plans to mobilise more fund to continue the programme. Some projects are calling for private fundings. But they are suitable for methadone replacement and providing condoms and needles. It will be more difficult when dealing with communications, testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS. In 2015, when the information about withdrawing international funding was first made public, the rate of HV/AIDS carriers with health insurance was about 30-40 per cent. So far, the number is only up to some 50 per cent. Do you think the process of providing health insurance is too slow? We have examined why the rate is so low and learned that many people hesitate to use health insurance as their personal information can be exposed. They are afraid that their HIV/AIDS disease will be stated on the insurance card. In fact, such information will not be on the card. The medical record will be confidential. To help the patients understand more about the programme, we will provide them with information leaflets about how to buy health insurance, how much they have to pay and where to buy it. In the past, HIV/AIDS treatment was free so patients did not pay much attention to health insurance. A recent decision of the Prime Minister has set the target of having all patients covered by health insurance by 2020. Also in the past, nearly 400 clinics with ARV supply received fundings for staff salaries, drugs. But now, they will face many difficulties. How will we deal with difficulties when the funding ends by the end of 2018? Currently, there are nearly 230,000 HIV/AIDS carriers in Việt Nam, 116,000 of those are receiving ARV treatment. Without donor funds, we will need a huge amount of finance to maintain treatment. In the past, ARV treatment aimed to reduce the death rate. But now, everyone found to have HIV/AIDS can get ARV treatment for prevention and good health. The Government has pledged a 90-90-90 model, which means 90 per cent of people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of people who know their status are on HIV treatment; and 90 per cent of all people on treatment will have undetectable levels of HIV in their body. We are going to reach the first target as some 80 per cent of affected people have been discovered. As for the third target, Việt Nam is among the countries with qualified treatment for HIV/AIDS patients beyond the requirements of international organisations. However, the second target, or the number of patients receiving ARV treatment, is still low. The bidding on providing drugs under the health insurance system for HIV/AIDS patients will start now (within the first quarter of 2017) and the drugs will be provided to patients in the third quarter of this year. — VNS",Society,"['drugs', 'funds', 'arv', 'patients', 'việt', 'vn', 'foreign', 'absent', 'hivaids', 'cent', 'aids', 'target', 'control', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the Ministry of Health’s Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the Tuổi Trẻ (Youth) about plans for HIV/AIDS treatment.

Palliative care guidelines updated,"All people who suffer from life-threatening diseases will be eligible for palliative care, with the care beginning as soon as their diseases are detected, due to a change in a national guidance on palliative care.",[],2017-08-05,vietnamnews.vn,"A doctor examines an HIV patient at the Việt Nam-Czech Friendship Hospital in the northern port city of Hải Phòng. — VNA/VNS Photo Dương Ngọc HÀ NỘI — All people who suffer from life-threatening diseases will be eligible for palliative care, with the care beginning as soon as their diseases are detected, due to a change in a national guidance on palliative care. Lương Ngọc Khuê, head of the Department of Medical Examination and Treatment under health ministry made the statement on Thursday during discussion on amendments to the guidance. According to the World Health Organisation, palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and treatment of pain and other problems. In 2006, with assistance from national and international experts, the health ministry issued guidance on palliative care for cancer and AIDS patients. Khuê said the guidance was a legal basis and reference point for healthcare workers to deliver proper care. “So far, hundreds of doctors and nurses have undergone palliative care training and thousands of patients have received improved care in the last stage of their life,” Khuê said. The updated document expands the subjects of the specialised medical and nursing care to all people with life-limiting illnesses. It also encourages the building of multi-component groups, which include medical staff, families, social workers and volunteers, to care for patients. Palliative care can take place at hospitals, at home and within the community. Eric Krakauer, an expert from the World Health Organisation, said the therapy helps reduce pain and should be incorporated into primary and comprehensive healthcare. According to Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control under the Ministry of Health, by May this year, Việt Nam had more than 209,000 people living with HIV. In the first five months of this year, more than 1,900 people infected with the HIV virus contracted AIDS. The first five month of this year saw 3,546 new HIV cases and 641 HIV-related deaths, deceases of 11 per cent and 34 per cent respectively compared with the same period last year. The administration also reported that only about 50 per cent of people with HIV in Việt Nam have health insurance cards, with some not buying the insurance as they are afraid of discrimination, others being unable to afford it and some lacking necessary personal legal documents. People living with HIV/AIDS in Việt Nam used to receive assistance from international organisations to cover medical costs and medicines. Most of the assistance was cut when Việt Nam became a middle-income country. In response, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc asked localities and central agencies to arrange funding to buy health insurance for all people living with HIV. — VNS",Society,"['updated', 'medical', 'ministry', 'patients', 'việt', 'care', 'nam', 'palliative', 'hiv', 'living', 'guidelines', 'health']","— VNA/VNS Photo Dương NgọcHÀ NỘI — All people who suffer from life-threatening diseases will be eligible for palliative care, with the care beginning as soon as their diseases are detected, due to a change in a national guidance on palliative care.

Community organisations serving HIV at-risk groups shift to fee-based business model,"Six of 31 community-based organisations (CBOs) that serve people in HIV at-risk groups in the country’s southern region are becoming social enterprises, moving from free services to fee-based models, as international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention to Việt Nam will end in several years.",[],2017-09-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — Six of 31 community-based organisations (CBOs) that serve people in HIV at-risk groups in the country’s southern region are becoming social enterprises, moving from free services to fee-based models, as international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention to Việt Nam will end in several years. The CBOs that serve HIV at-risk groups, which number around 135,000 people, have depended on international aid for years, but now must seek other sources to maintain services. Speaking at a workshop held on Friday in HCM City, Phạm Thị Thùy Chi, an independent counsellor for developing organisations and companies, said that social enterprises formed from CBOs have a deep understanding about the needs of the groups they serve, but they lack professional administrative knowledge. Phạm Hồng Sơn, director of the social enterprise G3VN Co. in HCM City, which designs websites and offers other services, said that his company was once a CBO providing services such as counselling for HIV testing for men who have sex with men. Since members of the LGBT community in HCM City are reluctant to go to hospitals for fear of discrimination, G3VN has set up a “friendly health clinic” to provide services for the community. “G3VN has pledged to use 51 per cent of its profits to sponsor social programmes which the community needs,” Sơn said. Lê Hồng Thái of HCM City’s Đá Khóc CBO, which provides HIV prevention services to people who inject drugs, told Việt Nam News that Đá Khóc had merged with the city’s ALOBOY and Hoa Cỏ May CBOs to create the Alofood social enterprise. ALOBOY provides services such as counselling on HIV testing to men who have sex with men and transgender people, while Hoa Cỏ May serve prostitutes and people who inject drugs. The social enterprises will offer Alofood products such as fruit and vegetables. Since these three CBOs provide services to about 5,000 people, Thái said they could be potential customers for Alofood products. “We will also seek opportunities to co-operate with a trusted company,” he added. Initially, Alofood employees from southern provinces such as Tây Ninh and Bến Tre will return to their hometowns to work with agricultural co-operatives on the social enterprise’s project. Alofood plans to donate 52 per cent of its profit to HIV prevention and other social activities, Thái said. A source from Nguyễn Tất Thành University’s high-tech agriculture faculty in HCM City said the University would counsel Alofood on market development strategies, while Vĩnh Long Green Agriculture Co. has pledged to provide vegetables to Alofood. A representative from the Việt Hưng Textile Garment Co said the company would work with the general health clinic set up by the social enterprise G3VN (called the Galant clinic) to provide healthcare services to its workers.

The 2006-08 project will be implemented by the National Assembly’s Committee for Social Affairs, in co-ordination with the authorities of three provinces: Lang Son in the north, Khanh Hoa in the centre and An Giang in the south. The director of the NA’s Committee for Social Affairs, Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu, said at the signing ceremony in Ha Noi yesterday that there were still many challenges ahead in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam. ""HIV is a disease, but effective prevention and control does not depend solely on the efforts of the health sector, but also on the efforts of all of society, including government and elected bodies at all levels."" In response, acting UNDP Resident Representative Subinay Nandy said effective leadership was essential in the fight against HIV/AIDS. ""Good policies and a solid legal framework will encourage all of society, particularly those affected by HIV and AIDS, to get involved."" He said it was vital that everyone, including those living with or affected by HIV/AIDS, participate in decision-making, have access to accurate information, quality treatment and health care services. Most importantly, he suggested, it was necessary for all people to live free from discrimination. International experiences have shown that leaders have a valuable role in engaging the public to fight stigma and intolerance, as well as to set an example in the struggle against HIV/AIDS, he added. Beyond the central level, the project will help authorities of the three provinces to integrate HIV/AIDS concerns into local socio-economic development plans, and ensure that the approach to HIV/AIDS prevention at the local level is collaborative. People’s Councils and local government will be supported in taking a leading role in guiding the implementation of public information campaigns to eliminate stigma and discrimination directed at people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).

The programme will be first implemented in Ha Noi, HCM City and provinces of Dien Bien, and Nghe An and Thanh Hoa from the fourth quarter of this year to the end of the third quarter of 2017. The department said it would publish guidelines for proper HIV testing and provide training to non-specialised health workers, and also adopt a mechanism for co-ordination between community-based organisations and clinics that perform HIV tests and those offering anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment. A system for monitoring and evaluating community-based HIV testing results will also be launched. There are three community-based HIV testing models including mobile HIV testing and counselling, HIV testing and counselling at local health care units, and community-based organisations. These testing models will be applied to groups of people who are drug addicts, relatives of HIV carriers (wife, husband and their children), sex workers, and gays and lesbians, in addition to men at places that have high rate of HIV sufferers (over 1 per cent). Statistics from the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control showed that as of June, there were 227,114 people living with HIV in Viet Nam. Of these, 71,115 HIV carriers had progressed to AIDS and 76,588 people had died. The country has over 1,100 HIV testing and counselling units and 98 HIV testing laboratories that conduct tests of around 2 million samples each year. It is estimated that about 200,000 people living with HIV are aware of their status while the remaining are unaware, thereby posing high risk of HIV transmission in society. The community-based HIV testing and counselling programme takes place at a time when the funding for HIV prevention is to be reduced and traditional HIV test models have met with difficulties. Health officials said at a workshop held in Ha Noi last month that Viet Nam will need at least VND7.4 trillion (US$329 million) for the programme from 2016 to 2020, but it will lack about 11 per cent of the capital.

Software to ensure health insurance for HIV patients,An electronic health information system (eHIS) aims to help people living with HIV/AIDS get more benefits from social health insurance.,[],2016-07-21,vietnamnews.vn,"ĐIỆN BIÊN — An electronic health information system (eHIS) with the aims to help people living with HIV/AIDS get more benefits from social health insurance has been developed in the northern Điện Biên Province’s Tuần Giáo District Healthcare Centre. The system-part of the Sustainable Management of HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical Assistance project launched by the Vietnamese government and the United States Agency for International Development (USAIDS) is an integration of an HIV module and medical records of people with HIV/AIDS, according to project officials. The HIV software module allows the district healthcare centre to easily track and request reimbursement for HIV patient examinations and services. After three months of implementing the project, the district healthcare centre reported it had received more than VNĐ22.7 million (US$1,000) as reimbursement from the health insurance fund for HIV patient examinations. The centre said it was managing 467 HIV patients through the eHIS, allowing doctors to make better decisions by providing easy access to medical records of patients such as clinic assessments, test results and treatment for both infections and HIV. The software was expected to be fine-tuned and implemented across Điện Biên Province and the central Nghệ An Province, according to project official. Trịnh Đức Long, director of the Tuần Giáo District Healthcare Centre, on Thursday said at a workshop on sharing experiences on social health insurance for HIV patients that local people living with HIV/AIDS were poor and faced many difficulties such as lack of transportation to travel long distances to healthcare centres for treatment or lack of health insurance. Social health insurance coverage of HIV services was their social security, he said. The eHIS has greatly helped to revolutionise local healthcare service procedures, Long said. “Healthcare providers such as us can now monitor patients better, request reimbursement from social health insurance, and process detailed patient reports with a single click. For patients, it means we have more time to care for them and can do so more quickly and effectively as making patient records are instantly accessible,” Long said. Đỗ Thị Nhàn, director of the care and treatment department at the Việt Nam authority for HIV/AIDS control under the health ministry, said the project by USAIDS helped health centres use electronic health information systems for treatment and programme reporting. This would help to ensure the sustainability of the HIV programme, given the upcoming funding cuts, and also strengthen their ability to evaluate the effectiveness and ongoing quality of treatment programmes, she said. — VNS",Society,"['ensure', 'patient', 'social', 'project', 'patients', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'software', 'healthcare', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","The HIV software module allows the district healthcare centre to easily track and request reimbursement for HIV patient examinations and services.

HIV club becomes model help group,"After being driven to near financial ruin and blamed by her husband's family for contracting HIV, Duong Thu Huong was saddened once again when doctors reported that her nine-month old son would die of AIDS within days.",[],2006-11-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HIV club becomes model help group (30-11-2006) by Thu Giang and Quynh Hoa QUANG NINH — After being driven to near financial ruin and blamed by her husband’s family for contracting HIV, Duong Thu Huong was saddened once again when doctors reported that her nine-month old son would die of AIDS within days. Huong, like many other women in Viet Nam, has faced insurmountable difficulties since discovering she had contracted the deadly disease. In a country where suicides are not uncommon when a patient is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, Huong has found hope in the Hoa xuong rong (Cactus Flower) Club. Run by other HIV infected individuals, the club helps those living with the disease through volunteer work and direct financial support, and tries to break down the many negative stigmas HIV/AIDS has in Viet Nam. As a result of its success, the club has become the new model for the Government’s Centre for Community Health and Development (COHED). The group has also received support from the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a US funded programme to help infected women overcome discrimination in both society and their families. When Huong discovered she had HIV, her husband’s family was far from supportive. ""I was shocked and scared when I received the test results. My husband’s family blamed it all on me, and told everyone that I was a debauched wife. With no care and no money, I almost killed myself,"" said Huong in a recent interview. The family eventually discovered that a man, with which Huong’s husband had shared a knife to tattoo themselves, had died from AIDS and was the likely culprit in spreading the disease. Thanks to a suggestion from a relative in the healthcare profession, Huong joined the Cactus Flower Club a year ago, and now helps other families and individuals cope with HIV/AIDS. If a person is excommunicated by their relatives, the club will take them in, and care for them. ""We have nothing to lose. We are willing to do anything from helping a person bathe and feed themselves to washing clothes. Through our work, we hope that people living with AIDS will at least experience a small degree of joy before passing away,"" said Huong. When the club’s Ha Long City chapter opened a year ago, Huong was one of 58 members who were divided into three groups. The first group included 30 people who were public about living with HIV/AIDS and were responsible for approaching other women who seek consoling and healthcare. The second group had 25 people who were responsible for disseminating information to the public and caring for people living with HIV/AIDS. The last group consisted of three people who co-ordinated the chapter’s operations. After its first year, the chapter approached more than 3,640 people, of which 395 were living with HIV/AIDS, and cared for nearly 40 AIDS patients. ""One year may seem like a short time for a healthy person, but it is a very long time for a person living with HIV/AIDS,"" says Nguyen Thi Thom, a fellow club member. Dr. Nguyen Thi Tien, club chief, says the group still faces a number of difficulties; many of its members have limited education, financial support and accesses to medicine. There are also problems in gathering accurate information in the rural and coastal provinces on the number of people living with HIV/AIDS and the number of new infections. The club, though, does have the financial and technical support of US-based PEPFAR. According to Duong Quoc Trong, director of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, PEPFAR has been an active contributor to local organisations since beginning HIV/AIDS prevention programmes in June 2004. PEPFAR has so far supplied anti-retroviral drugs to more than 3,300 patients and has treated more than 800 pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child infection. Trong added that the Ministry of Health had also supported PEPFAR’s Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic – Global Aids Programme.

They worked unofficially at first but when physicians and health staff saw the positive result of their effort, the Thanh Hoa Health Department joined with them in establishing contact with potential carriers and having them tested. Initially, many could not understand why such young women could dedicate their lives to such a dangerous task but they changed when they heard the story of their lives and their motives for doing the work. The family of Nguyen Thuy Phuong (not her real name) was poor, but she and her four siblings were educated. Her eldest brother, a truck driver, was addicted to drugs and her family was traumatised when they found that he was infected with the deadly virus. Grief-stricken, and encouraged by a thoughtless friend, Phuong became a prostitute. She stopped when one night she realised that she was alone and without virtue and began work as a vendor. It was not easy to forget the easy money but she did well. Today, she has a husband and is the mother of three children. The other six tell similar stories: They worked either as prostitutes; had addicted siblings or abusive husbands. They joined together to atone for past actions and help others to avoid the virus. Building a rapport with those they want to help is their most difficult task. Some of these are solitary while others work in hotels and restaurants so the seven divide into what they call the street group and the entertainment group. Hanh, 31, says her first task is to contact with a girl famous for her youth and beauty and working in Sam Son named Mai (not her real name) who is infected with the virus. She knew such an attractive girl was unlikely to practise safe sex. But it took ten visits to the karaoke where the youngster works and a recounting of her own story before Hanh was able to persuade Mai about the danger of infecting others. Another of the seven, Van, 25, says: ""I always see addicts inject themselves with the same needle."" Once, seeing five doing so and understanding that this was a way of spreading the virus, she waited until the effects of the drug had worn off and told them about the dangers of using the same needle and gave them money to buy their own. Sam Son has an estimated 200 addicts and 100 prostitutes. The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is not known although 51 incidents have been reported. The seven young women have persuaded three prostitutes to quit their work and two now have their own families.",Society,"['peer', 'young', 'help', 'women', 'fight', 'seven', 'hivaids', 'join', 'infected', 'son', 'hoa', 'group', 'work', 'task', 'successful']","Women join fight against HIV/AIDS with successful peer group(15-08-2005)A public information station to tackle HIV/AIDS in Tan Chau town in the southern province of An Giang. — VNA/VNS Photo Hoang HaiTHANH HOA — Seven young women, who have formed a dong dang, or peer group, to both prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and help those already infected in Thanh Hoa Province on the central coast, are linked by a common fate.

An HIV doctor’s devotion goes beyond the call,"Dr Ngô Thị Ánh Đông is so devoted to her job and patients, and was one of 113 people honoured by the HCM City People’s Committee and Việt Nam Fatherland Front for their contributions to a civilised society and to the promotion of a good quality of life.",[],2016-12-14,vietnamnews.vn,"Gia Lộc HCM CITY — Dr Ngô Thị Ánh Đông is so devoted to her job and patients, and so well-loved, that when she’s absent from the health clinic on any given day, people tend to panic. Where is she? the patients ask. They even call her up to ask if anything is wrong. “It shows that I’m lodged deep in their heart,” the 62-year-old said. Since 2005, Dr Đông has been working at an outpatient clinic for HIV patients at Bình Thạnh District’s Preventive Health Centre. The clinic provides counselling, antiretroviral (ARV) therapy and community-based support to 1,800 people with HIV. “I’ll work until my health will no longer allow me,” Đông said. “I don’t dare quit because I’m not sure if my replacement would be as devoted as I am."" In 1999, Đông began working as an obstetrician at the Preventive Health Centre in District 4, and was hired in 2001 as the only doctor at the centre’s outpatient clinic. Since that time, she has mostly treated people with HIV. “I’ve wanted to quit many times, but I haven’t,"" Đông said. ""When we show patients love, they treat us kindly. I’ve never been badly treated by patients."". She recalled that, one day after a heavy rain, Xóm Chiếu Street where the clinic is located was flooded. She should have stayed at home, but after several patients phoned her, Đông left to visit them. “If I hadn’t gone, what would have happened to them? At that time, they needed me,” Đông said, adding that patients also need “warm arms and love” from health officials and the community. Many people in the community, however, are not sympathetic to HIV patients and, unfortunately, display discriminatory attitudes toward them, she said. Đông is determined to treat the patients with respect so they can become confident and integrate into society. One patient, Nguyễn Hùng Minh (not his real name), said that when he learned of his HIV status he was “shocked and depressed”. But Dr Đông showed him respect and helped him get a job as a peer educator for HIV patients. Minh in his job speaks with people and encourages them to take a HIV test, and if the results are positive, asks them to agree to receive ARV therapy. “If I hadn’t met Dr Đông, I wouldn’t be healthy and have such a stable job,” he said. The wife of a man with HIV spoke about Đông’s dedication. ""She called my husband when she realised that he was not taking his medicine on schedule."" Nguyễn Thị Hường, the clinic’s new doctor, said: “Đông shows enthusiasm when she works with me. She teaches me everything, including how to communicate with people with HIV and the best medical treatments.” Đông knows the living circumstance of each person with HIV treated at the clinic, Hường said, adding that Đông also helps them try to overcome their personal difficulties. Late last month, Đông was one of 113 people honoured by the HCM City People’s Committee and Việt Nam Fatherland Front for their contributions to a civilised society and to the promotion of a good quality of life. Nguyễn Thành Phong, chairman of the city People’s Committee, who spoke at the ceremony, said: “Their silent and noble contributions need to be honoured because they are done from their heart.

Official: Progress made on reducing HIV transmission,"The number of people with HIV in Viet Nam has fallen to under 0.3 per cent, said National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs Vice Chairman Dang Thuan Phong at a conference on Thursday.",[],2014-07-12,vietnamnews.vn,"HA NOI (VNS) —The number of people with HIV in Viet Nam has fallen to under 0.3 per cent, said National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs Vice Chairman Dang Thuan Phong at a conference on Thursday. The Ha Noi-based conference, ""Investment strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and control"", was organized by the National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs in coordination with the Viet Nam Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Phong said that Viet Nam had successfully achieved ""three reductions"" in efforts to decrease the number of people diagnosed with HIV, the rate of cases that progressed to AIDS and the number of AIDS-related deaths. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in May showed that the number of new HIV positive patients had fallen to 2,012 in the first quarter of this year, a 35 per cent drop from the same period last year. The number of cases that had progressed to AIDS had decreased by 47 per cent while the number of AIDS-related deaths had declined by 53 per cent. However, Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control Director General Nguyen Hoang Long warned that the number of HIV/AIDS infections were increasing. He said that 77 per cent of HIV transmission in the community was driven by drug use. Unprotected sexual activity with prostitutes and between same-sex partners were also alleged to be factors contributing to HIV transmission. Participants at the conference agreed that the latter factors presented challenges in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The limited services available to the public was also said to be constraining efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Statistics provided by the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control at the conference showed one third of HIV-positive patients were unable to receive treatment and that the supply of condoms and syringes was not meeting demand. Financial struggle Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control Director General Nguyen Hoang Long said that the budget for the national target programme on HIV/AIDS prevention and control had decreased since 2012. The budget was reduced from VND 245 billion (US$ 11.7 million) in 2012 to VND207 billion ($10 million) in the following year and has been slashed 60 per cent to VND 83 billion ($4 million) in 2014. He also said that international assistance had supported up to 80 per cent of expenditure to control HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam but that finance for the projects was in its final stage. The prime minister-approved plan ""Securing finance for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the period of 2013-2020"" received praise from UNAIDS Viet Nam Country Director, Kristan Schoultz as a long term effort against HIV/AIDS. Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control also proposed a new national target program in HIV/AIDS prevention and control for the period of 2016-2020 and a plan to secure funds to provide ARV (HIV antiretroviral drug) and methadone, the two most commonly used drugs for HIV. Future plans The administration stressed that the key objective was to strengthen prevention and containment efforts for HIV/AIDS, including rolling out HIV/AIDS control centers across the country, treatment centers for AIDS patients and treatment centers utilising methadone therapy. Future plans to raise public awareness and provide education were also raised at the conference.

Viet Nam News reporter Le Quynh Anh spoke to relevant stakeholders on how Viet Nam should move forward. Professor Chung A, senior advisor to the Government on HIV/AIDS affairs The fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been going on for 20 years. There was a period from 1995 to 2005 where we faced extreme difficulties as HIV spread rapidly. However, because the desire to combat this disease remains strong throughout the entire political system, we have gradually brought the situation under control. In addition, our strategies to fight HIV/AIDS have been consistent with international practice. For that reason, we received a lot of support from the international community. Since 2009, the number of new HIV infections has steadily decreased. Also, we have built well-trained task forces that are on active duty around the country. Another remarkable figure is that nearly 70,000 HIV/AIDS patients have received treatment – an achievement we did not dare to dream of 10 years ago. The HIV-infected patients have growing confidence in the Government so they participate more actively in the HIV/AIDS efforts initiated by the Government. As we have successfully emerged from poverty to become a low middle-income country, we now face the challenge of reduced international assistance. It makes sense that donors would relocate resources to more economically challenged countries. We are facing an imminent shortage of resources for HIV/AIDS. Over the last decade, we have increased the level of funding for HIV/AIDS activities from US$0.06 to $1 per capita. International assistance accounts for 80 per cent of the total: the annual funding from the State hovers around $7 million, while contributions from donors can be as high as $87 million. Once these contributions stop, we will face an enormous challenge. And in the absence of international support, our capacity to build HIV/AIDS task forces will be greatly affected. These are concerns that the Government has started to address. Meanwhile, the reduction of international assistance occurs as the HIV epidemic in Viet Nam is undergoing a dramatic shift. HIV infection is no longer concentrated in urban areas but has begun to spread to remote rural districts. As HIV finds its way to ethnic people who have struggled with poverty for years, new challenges emerge. Another new challenge is that drug users, especially youngsters, have switched to synthetic drugs. Without continued funding, we may face a new wave of the HIV epidemic. To move forward, first of all, we need to maintain the strong political will to combat this disease that was displayed in previous years. Secondly, the National Assembly should revisit its budget plan to allocate more funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. While it is inevitable that we must increase the funding from the State budget, we also need to draw resources from other stakeholders. Why dont we begin with the community itself? As of now, all of the HIV-related treatment expenses are fully covered, so we should come up with mechanisms that are more selective. For example, patients who are in better financial condition should be required to share their burdens with the State. We could also seek support from enterprises, charity organisations and religious groups. Advisors even recommended the Government use Official Development Assistance in the fight against the HIV epidemic, just as these funds are used to develop infrastructure. Tony E. Lisle, Country Director, UNAIDS Viet Nam Tony E. Lisle Viet Nam has made great progress in responding to HIV in recent years. Coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ARV) has increased 22-fold since 2005, providing life-saving treatment for more than 60 per cent of adults and more than 80 per cent of children living with HIV. New infections among injecting drug users and sex workers are stable following the scale-up of the needle and syringe program, the condom program and the methadone maintenance treatment program.

Coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ARV) has increased 22-fold since 2005, providing life-saving treatment for more than 60 per cent of adults and more than 80 per cent of children living with HIV. New infections among injecting drug users and sex workers are stable following the scale-up of the needle and syringe program, the condom program and the methadone maintenance treatment program. The international community currently funds more than 70 per cent of Viet Nams HIV response and an even greater percentage of HIV treatment and prevention programmes targeting key populations at higher risk of infection. However, that will change. Viet Nam is one of the 21st centurys economic success stories, and soon it will no longer need international development assistance. As aid slowly reduces, Viet Nam will need to invest more domestic resources on evidence-informed, cost-effective and rights-based approaches. The priority should be a smooth continuum of HIV prevention, treatment and care services for people who inject drugs, sex workers and men who have sex with men. The ARV program also needs special attention. We now know that people on treatment are much less likely to transmit the virus to others, so we need to diagnose people living with HIV and get them on treatment as soon as possible. In order to do this, Viet Nam must take additional measures to reduce stigma and discrimination related to HIV. And during the transition from international to domestic funding, UN organisations and the international community will continue to provide policy and technical assistance as Viet Nam transitions to a more efficient and more sustainable phase of its national response to HIV. Regarding the shift pattern in the mode of HIV infections, it is true that there has been a gradual increase in the percentage of new HIV infections through sexual intercourse. However, injecting drug use remains the most important mode of transmission in Viet Nam. Ministry of Health data shows us that men still account for about two-thirds of new infections, and most of those infections are from unsafe injections. Among women, 15 per cent who tested positive for HIV reported that their only risk was a male sexual partner who injected drugs. This shows us that many of the HIV infections through sexual transmission are linked to drug-use. Some people call this ""intimate partner transmission"" or ""secondary transmission"". This only emphasises that we need to focus on the primary sources of new infections – drug injection, sex work and male-to-male sexual intercourse. The Government of Viet Nam has taken some bold steps to address these issues more effectively. The National Assembly made a decision to stop sending sex workers to five centres. The Government is working to shift more rapidly to community-based and voluntary drug treatment services. All of these brave efforts are facilitating greater access to HIV services. Viet Nam is an emerging regional leader on these issues. UN organisations would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam for this and encourage additional focus on HIV services that are proven to be effective and focus on the populations in greatest need. Dinh Thi Thanh Ba, director of Do Son medical centre, Do Son District, Hai Phong City Dinh Thi Thanh Ba Since the first case of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam was reported in 1990, Hai Phong City has consistently been listed among the 10 provinces with the highest HIV incidence. That is why donors have so far implemented a lot of prevention and care programmes in Hai Phong. This has contributed remarkably to the positive outcomes of the citys efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. The rates of new infections and AIDS-related deaths have been on a downward trend from their peak in 2003. Since the first case of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam was reported in 1990, Hai Phong City has consistently been listed among the 10 provinces with the highest HIV incidence.

The rates of new infections and AIDS-related deaths have been on a downward trend from their peak in 2003. One of the most important legacies of such long-term interventions is that awareness about the disease and knowledge about how to protect oneself from it have found its way into peoples mind-sets. This is strongly demonstrated in Do Son – a coastal resort 20km away from the citys centre. Do Son was notorious as a centre for prostitution and it used to be a hot spot for HIV spreading via sexual transmission. However, now the situation has been reined in due largely to a major change in attitudes and behaviour. According to our field surveillance, the level of condom use among female sex workers is high. Sex workers in Do Son, unlike in other places, are not street prostitutes in the sense that most of them work inside restaurants or karaoke bars and are managed by these shops owners. It might be a surprise to many people that it is the owners themselves that take the initiative to distribute condoms to their sex workers and require them to be used. In some exceptional cases, some prostitutes refuse to have intercourse because their clients do not wear condoms: radical progress compared to just a few years ago. So I think it is safe to say that the component to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS has done its job quite well and it may not create so big a disruption if we scale it down. However, the reduction of international assistance will greatly affect our efforts in the area of providing HIV treatment and care services. As in the case of Hai Phong City, all ARV drugs are provided for free by our development partners. So the top concern here is how we will find alternative resources to keep providing ARV drugs to those in need. The monthly cost of ARV drugs for one patient is about VND300,000 ($14), not including the expenses for a number of blood tests. One solution that has been widely discussed is to list ARV drugs under the medicine that is eligible to be covered by health insurance. We would also like donors to transfer the technology to produce ARV drugs so Viet Nam can manufacture the drugs in Viet Nam to reduce costs. Another concern is how we can continue to make use of well-trained human resources. For example, under many donor-supported projects, a doctor specialising in treating HIV is posted in each health centre for HIV/AIDS patients and receives a salary from the projects. But as many projects are going to terminate by 2015, it is very likely that these experts will be relocated to other workplaces because no one will pay them if they stay. This will be a waste of resources, as those who are trained will not do what they are trained for while there is still a need for experts in HIV treatment. — VNS",Opinion,"['drugs', 'international', 'need', 'nam', 'hiv', 'battle', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'infections', 'faces', 'uphill', 'sex', 'treatment']","Viet Nam News reporter Le Quynh Anh spoke to relevant stakeholders on how Viet Nam should move forward.

VN strives to reduce HIV infections despite funding shortage,"Việt Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in funding from the international community, health officials said.",[],2017-08-21,vietnamnews.vn,"Việt Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in international funding. — Photo antt.vn HÀ NỘI — Việt Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in international funding, health officials say. According to the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, the country began offering Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to people at high risk of contracting HIV, especially gays, in June 2017. Those who are at high risk of contracting the virus can take an antiretroviral (ARV) drug which contains tenofovir every day. When they are exposed to HIV through sex or recreational drug injections, the oral HIV PrEP can work to keep them from becoming infected. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infections in people who are at high risk by up to 92 percent. The pilot project providing PrEP is being implemented in HCM City until September 2018. Its results will be used to formulate national guidelines and financial mechanisms for PrEP provision in the coming time. Besides this, the Health Ministry has scaled up community-based HIV testing services, focusing on 15 cities and provinces with large numbers of HIV infections; and piloted the HIV self-testing in which people can perform a test on a sample of their saliva at community-based institutions. It has also expanded a network of district-based public clinics that provide HIV confirmatory tests in ""hotspots"" like HCM City, Thanh Hóa, Sơn La, Điện Biên, Nghệ An, Yên Bái and Lào Cai. This has helped reduce waiting time for results and save costs. The Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control estimates that in the first five months of the year, over 3,500 people tested HIV-positive, 2,000 infected people contracted full blown AIDS and 641 died of the disease, down 11 percent, 21 percent and 34 percent, respectively, from the same period last year. However, 20 cities and provinces in the country saw year-on-year increases in the number of new HIV infections, including Hà Nội, Tây Ninh, Yên Bái, Tiền Giang, Kiên Giang, HCM City and Phú Thọ. The number of new HIV infections in Hà Nội and HCM City accounted for 25 per cent of the national total. The number of HIV infections among gays has been on the rise since 2013 and unprotected intercourse is still the most common way the virus is transmitted in the country. Many challenges remain for HIV/AIDS control in the country, largely owing to the lack of funding, said Dr. Hoàng Đình Cảnh, deputy head of the Vietnam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control. He said the lack of funding had resulted in ineffective harm reduction interventions and communication, while the number of people receiving Methadone and ARV treatment had only increased slightly. In the remaining months of the year, authorities plan to ramp up communication campaigns on HIV/AIDS control and prevention with the focus on preventing exposure to HIV, early HIV testing, early ARV treatment and inviting more people to join health insurance schemes, Cảnh said. The health sector would also increase health workers at HIV ""hotspots"" in remote areas and carry out HIV tests in prisons, he added. — VNS",Society,"['despite', 'funding', 'prep', 'việt', 'vn', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'infections', 'strives', 'risk', 'number', 'reduce', 'shortage', 'health']","Việt Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in international funding. — Photo antt.vnHÀ NỘI — Việt Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in international funding, health officials say.

At the conference on HIV/AIDS held in Ha Noi, Director of the Ministry of Healths HIV/AIDS Prevention and Fighting Department Nguyen Hoang Long said that HIV infections remained a serious concern, with an average of 13,000 new cases reported last year. Of these, 5,000 had serious health issues as a result and 2,000 died. Long said health staff at ministries and in localities had been assigned to work on HIV/AIDS prevention and response. Thus, about 10 million people were instructed about the epidemic, an increase of three million compared with the previous year. About 100,000 people benefited from antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 40,000 others were given methadone treatment. Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long appraised the health sectors efforts. He also showed concern about the difficulties and challenges the country would face due to international aid cuts. More than 70 per cent of the countrys HIV/AIDS response came from international organisations, but the funds were reduced due to the countrys new middle-income status and the global financial crisis. Long pointed out four key tasks for the year. The ministry would continue implementing the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Fighting to reduce the infection rate to below 0.3 per cent, promote the participation of sectors and organisations in the work, enhance professional activities, and expand the healthcare network to assure the supply of drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment. — VNS",Society,"['response', 'aid', 'international', 'difficulties', 'vn', 'hinder', 'hivaids', 'cuts', 'continue', 'prevention', 'efforts', 'countrys', 'cent', 'curb', 'health']","Drug addicted people receive methadone at a HIV/AIDS prevention centre.

HIV/AIDS victim fights to raise awareness,"Though you wouldn't know it just looking at her, Dao Phuong Thanh has a life-threatening illness.",[],2008-10-26,vietnamnews.vn,"Altruists at work: Thanh and her Hoa Sua group members collect syringes at a waste area in Van Mieu Street in an effort to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in the community. (26-10-2008) by Ha Nguyen Though you wouldn’t know it just looking at her, Dao Phuong Thanh has a life-threatening illness. Thanh, founder of the Hoa Sua Group, which offers help and support to people living with HIV/AIDS, has been HIV positive for almost five years. In 2004, while giving an injection to her brother, who had AIDS, the syringe slipped and tore through Thanh’s plastic glove, puncturing her ring finger. ""I fainted out of fear while my sister tried to squeeze the blood out of my finger, hoping that I wouldn’t get HIV from my brother,"" Thanh recalls, adding that her sister told her that she should not worry yet since the HIV virus doesn’t show up on tests for three to six months. After three months, Thanh went to the hospital for a test. ""Waiting for the doctor’s results that day was the longest day of my life,"" recalls Thanh. ""It was horrible news for me when I saw the test results: positive."" Thanh received the news at a time when she was already suffering from great misfortune: her father had recently died of liver cancer and her brother died of complications due to AIDS only nine days later. Her mother also passed away several months later. Thanh thought her life was at an end. She shut herself off from the world, refusing contact with everyone, even her friends. She didn’t use the telephone, the TV, didn’t even leave her house for almost seven months until one day a neighbour brought over a bowl of soup and spoon-fed her. ""The neighbour asked me to try and eat the soup and told me that health is everything. She didn’t know that I had HIV yet,"" says Thanh. ""Thanks to my neighbour, who helped me regain my confidence in life, I felt a bit better and tried to concentrate on the knowledge and experience I had gained about how to live with HIV during the years I spent taking care of my brother, who was infected by HIV/AIDS."" ""I also know that despite the fact that HIV/AIDS is a dangerous disease, patients can prolong their life if they are willing. I told myself I could not die because I have to feed three children, one of my own and two of my younger sister’s, who also died,""says Thanh. Since that day, Thanh has redoubled her efforts to help the community fight HIV/AIDS. She originally took up this work because of her family connection to HIV/AIDS, but now as an HIV positive person she feels even more strongly about sharing her experiences and helping other people affected by the disease. ""Many people were shocked when I told them that I have the HIV virus. It was very difficult for me to announce because I feared discrimination and bad behaviour from people, but I thought that telling true stories about what I had to cope with would be the best way to communicate with other people and reduce discrimination. ""Fortunately, the stories about my life have been shared by the community as many organisations know about me and my circumstances,"" Thanh told Viet Nam News. Hand of experience: Thanh takes care of an HIV patient at her house at 46 Luong Su B, in Ha Noi. — VNS Photos Doan Tung The Policy and Care, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), invited Thanh to participate in a course which teaches people with HIV/AIDS to assist each other. In August, 2004, Thanh and six other members founded the Hoa Sua Group, with the headquarters at her house at 46 Luong Su B Lane, Van Mieu Street in Ha Noi. The group now has over 100 members. The guidelines of the group call for friendliness and acceptance towards people with HIV/AIDS. The group has attracted many people affected by HIV, who had been without any hope of living a normal life for years. Nguyen Thi Hoa, from the northern province of Bac Ninh, a member of Hoa Sua for the last two years, says she arrived at a hospital in Ha Noi in very weak health, with oedema causing her legs to swell, a high fever, tuberculosis and many other ailments related to HIV. ""After one week, with help from Thanh and the group, my health was much better. The pain and fever were significantly reduced,"" says Hoa, adding that joining the group helped her regain her confidence in life. Another group member ,Thanh Xuan Truong, who got HIV while addicted to intravenous drugs, says he had relapsed into drug use three times and thought he couldn’t recover, but thanks to the Hoa Sua group, his health is better. ""The most important thing for me is my awareness of the disease and my confidence in life. Also, my life experience on how to share sympathy with other patients has been improved,"" says Truong. Another service Thanh introduced was a self-made a medical kit and treatment diagram which she uses to teach group members how to care for themselves. The group also visits and take cares of other HIV/AIDS patients in Ha Noi. Apart from giving consultations over the telephone to patients who are too afraid to be seen by people, Thanh and her group make house-calls. ""On Sundays we often collect used syringes, which are common in the city, in an effort to reduce the threat of HIV/AIDS to the community,"" says Thanh. In addition, Thanh and her group usually cooks a big pot of soup to bring to Dong Da Hospital, which has the largest number of HIV/AIDS patients in the capital. To earn money for the soup and other gifts for the patients, such as moon cakes and square cakes, Thanh has to seek funding from individuals and non-governmental organisations. Hoa Sua is not an official NGO so its operation is based entirely on the work of unpaid volunteers. Thanh and her group also assist patients outside the realm of medical care, opening a shop for male patients to repair motorbikes and teaching female patients to knit wool hats and handkerchiefs. But very few people want to buy products or have their motorbikes repaired by people with HIV, so Thanh often has to sell the items herself, often bringing them to conferences on HIV/AIDS. ""Our products have sold well at these conferences since foreign delegates buy them and wear them on the spot with tears in their eyes,"" says Thanh. At a Danida-funded seminar on HIV/AIDS in the workplace, Thanh and her group moved participants with their personal stories of discrimination towards people with HIV/AIDS. ""HIV/AIDS victims can work to earn a living for themselves. But we often lose our jobs due to discrimination. We want to get support and co-operation from other ordinary people and organisations,"" says Thanh. Thanh admits that she is often deeply affected by her work caring for patients with HIV/AIDS, often unable to eat after a particularly gruelling day. ""I sometimes think ‘I will stop the work next time’ but my love for the patients win. I return to take care of them again and again."" Many delegates to the seminar said that it was the first time they have had direct contact with people suffering from HIV/AIDS. ""These patients are not devils, they are people like us. They have the right to work and to live as other ordinary people,"" a delegate said. Thanh’s efforts have paid off and many more people have joined the Hoa Sua Group. She is calling for further assistance from local and foreign communities and organisations so the group can operate more effectively. According to the Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs more than 129,000 people had been infected with HIV by June 30 this year. — VNS",Sunday,"['sua', 'fights', 'patients', 'awareness', 'thanh', 'raise', 'hiv', 'care', 'hivaids', 'victim', 'hoa', 'life', 'group', 'work']","Thanh, founder of the Hoa Sua Group, which offers help and support to people living with HIV/AIDS, has been HIV positive for almost five years.

Since Viet Nam still experienced discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients, the project is all the more important, the director said, promising his department’s support for the project being carried out by Marie Stopes International Viet Nam (MSIVN). Lauding the HIV/VCT work done earlier by MSIVN and their experience in treating patients, Dr Nguyen Duc Anh said, ""Our patients feel more comfortable and face no discrimination at MSIVN’s HIV/VCT programme."" Other than HIV/VCT, MSIVN’s clinic also provides other services such as reproductive health counselling and treatment, benefiting female patients, the doctor said. Anh added that sex workers, especially those working the streets, required this service more as they travel frequently and have no other facility to check for HIV/AIDS and treatment. Such clients, who have the potential for spreading the disease, would find the clinics safe. VCT project spreads across region Other than Viet Nam, the Mekong Regional HIV/VCT Project is being carried out in Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand from 2006 to 2008 with the aim to develop, introduce and scale up a holistic and flexible model for integration of quality HIV/VCT into existing clinics, targeting the poor in the three countries. In Viet Nam, the project targets Ha Noi, Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Binh Duong provinces, and will provide effective access to VCT services and facilitate emotional, social and medical support for clients who test positive for HIV. The European Commission is the main sponsor for the 2.6 million euro project, providing 90 per cent of the project cost with 10 per cent coming from MSI. — VNS Dr Om Chhorvoin, the project’s regional director, said they would carry out the service not only at the MSIVN but also in other clinics to serve the clients. Together with China and Indonesia, Viet Nam is a nation with a high growth rate of people having HIV/AIDS among groups such as addicts, prostitutes and homosexuals. According to Viet Nam’s Department of HIV/AIDS, there are over 100,000 people having HIV/AIDS, including more than 17,000 AIDS patients and 13,000 newly-infected cases. Nga said though Viet Nam had reported a reduction in newly-infected cases from 17,000 in 2002 to 13,000 in 2005, the country was still at risk if no effective control was in place. Relevant agencies could not even update the count of HIV/AIDS patients in Viet Nam as many were not aware if they were carrying the disease, rendering the fight against the dreaded disease more complex, Nga said. ""Our current figure may represent only one third of the real patients,"" he said. The MSIVN clinic would remove the inhibitions of patients who refuse to go to specialised HIV/AIDS testing centres for the fear of being discriminated.

The project, which was launched in January 2009 and wrapped up this month, aimed to empower HIV/AIDS and migrant children and their families to effectively participate in local life. Run by the Save the Children foundation, the project targeted migrant children in northern Quang Ninh Province, HCM City and southern Ca Mau Province. Part of the work involved training more than 200 child leaders to participate in policy-making to advocate for the rights of HIV-affected and migrant children. Nearly 50,000 children took part in information and education activities under the project. Pham Phuong Dung, 12, living in Quang Ninh Provinces Cam Pha District, was one of the projects beneficiaries. Dung was born HIV-positive and her parents died from AIDS when she was still a child. Her 65-year-old grandmother, Tran Thi Phuong, became Dungs main caretaker. Being ashamed about their family situation, Dung and Phuong rejected all social activities and help from others. Phuong was worried that if someone knew that Dung had AIDS, her life would be ruined forever. It wasnt until Dung and her grandmother joined the project in 2009, that they received much-needed support. The project not only provided Dung with essential nutrition such as rice, oil and milk, as well as a bicycle to go to school, but also opportunities for playing, networking with people who are in the same situation, and taking part in various events that promote childrens rights. Pham Van Nghia, 28, a volunteer worker for the project, said he changed his understanding of the challenges faced by children living with HIV. ""There should be more and bigger forums, with more children and adults attending,"" said Nghia.

""What can I do?"" the 73-year-old woman replies to a question about whether her meagre income is enough to feed her HIV-positive son. ""I earn VND25,000 (US$1.5) a day selling lottery tickets which isn’t enough to buy food"" Mai says, ""It is already hard enough to make ends meet, not mention affording medicines for my son."" Mai’s husband died early, leaving his wife and two children behind. Her daughter is serving a life sentence in prison. Life would be much more difficult for Mai if she could not share her pain with other peers at the empathy club for the elderly. More importantly, the club lent her VND2 million ($121) to buy a heater for her grand-daughter to open a small hairdressing shop in 2006. ""The club encourages me to work for a living,"" Mai said, recalling how she had found nowhere to borrow VND20,000 when she was penniless. Her neighbours were too scared to talk with her and it was impossible to borrow money from them. HelpAge International, a non-government organi-sation, knows the dire straits Mai and other old people like her face, especially those responsible for family members living with HIV/AIDS. The organisation, in collaboration with the Viet Nam Women’s Union, has helped 1,394 old people in 67 empathy clubs borrow money to increase their income. There are approximately 3,300 club members in Ha Noi, Thai Nguyen, Nam Dinh and Quang Ninh. Most of them have used the loans to open small business like outdoor rice and pho stands. Many raise pigs and farm tiny plots of land. Like Mai, many borrowers are elderly citizens whose children are living with HIV/AIDS and/or have to take care of orphaned grandchildren. ""The loan is small but it is a great encouragement to my family,"" Mai said. Thanks to the loan her granddaughter doesn’t have to spend her entire income buying medicines for her uncle. The lucky ones However terrible her situation might be, Mai is one of the lucky ones. According to the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly, many more elderly need to borrow money or their family members will die. But the existing regulations are a hurdle of red-tape barring the elderly from accessing credit loans. ""Most organisations refuse to provide loans to the elderly impacted by HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, except the HelpAge International,"" said a senior official at the Viet Nam Women’s Union who asked not to be named. According to the director of the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly’s Economic Affair Board, Le Van Nhan, the problem would be solved if the association was allowed to play its role as a guarantor for the elderly to borrow loans. Under the existing regulations, only socio-political organisations like the Women’s Union, the Farmers’ Association, the War Veteran’s Association, and the Fatherland Front Committee have the credibility to guarantee loans without putting up collateral assets. The Viet Nam Association of the Elderly is merely a social organisation, so it cannot play its role as a trustee, according to Social Policy Bank Director Ha Thi Hanh. Hanh claims that the bank exists for the poor, and does not differentiate between old and young. Yet according to Nhan, the elderly can only take out loans with the help of their children or other organisations. The Viet Nam Association of the Elderly, meanwhile, could help old people to both access credit loans and pay off the debts. If only they were granted the power. Facts have shown that all elderly people borrowed money from the HelpAge International have been able to clear their debts. There are about 8.3 million old people in the country. The number of elderly impacted by HIV/AIDS is not available as no survey about the issue has ever been conducted. UNICEF and other international organisations place the number at 300,000. According to government statistics, Viet Nam has 129,715 people living with HIV, 26,840 people with full blown AIDS and a total of 39,664 people have lost their lives. According to a survey by the Viet Nam Women’s Union last year, about 74 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDs who responded to the survey were being taken care of by their parents or grandparents, 68 per cent of them by their mothers and grandmothers. Findings from another survey conducted by the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly among old people who had a HIV/AIDS victim in the family found that 82.6 per cent of these elderly had to care for between one to three family members. While old people have affirmed the important role they play in caring for their children living with HIV/AIDS, the official policies do not take care of them, not mention support their affected children.",Society,"['womens', 'families', 'care', 'hiv', 'nam', 'mai', 'elders', 'torn', 'viet', 'association', 'hivaids', 'living', 'union', 'old', 'elderly']","Elders care for families torn by HIV(08-10-2008)by Hong ThuyThe Women’s Union in Cao Thang Ward, Ha Long City in the northern Quang Ninh Province set up club to give financial support to 67 members.

HIV patient stars as HIV-positive hooker,"Pham Thi Hue, featured in Time magazine's issue about Asian Heroes in 2004, has just wrapped up the shooting of a new film in which she stars as an HIV-infected prostitute.",['Hoang Ha'],2010-08-25,vietnamnews.vn,"by Hoang Ha Charitable act: Pham Thi Hue, who lives with HIV, was among Time magazines Asian Heroes in 2004. She is playing the role of a prostitute also infected with HIV, in a new film by director Vinh Khuong. — File Photo HCM CITY — Pham Thi Hue, featured in Time magazines issue about Asian Heroes in 2004, has just wrapped up the shooting of a new film in which she stars as an HIV-infected prostitute. The film director Vinh Khuong said Hue was the worlds first HIV-infected person to play such a role. In the film, Hue, 31, plays the role of Thu who struggles to live with the disease and, at the same time, bring up her mentally ill younger sister. They both live in HCM Citys Binh Hung Hoa Cemetery. In the film, her sister, after being raped by a group of boys, runs across a railway track in a panic and is hit and killed by a train. Unable to bear the loss, Thu jumps off Binh Loi Bridge with the hope that she can reunite with the souls of her mother and sister. Wandering on the land of the earth, the ghost of Thu witnesses the life of a deaf and mute 70-year-old man, who was formerly rich. She realises that even wealthy people are not happy if they are greedy or selfish. ""The film focuses on spiritual issues and is a new way of disseminating information about HIV/AIDS prevention that helps people live fuller lives,"" Khuong said. Khuong said it took him seven years to collect funds and an additional two years to find actors for Sieu Thoat (Salvation). ""Some actors initially hesitated to act with a person with HIV,"" Khuong said. ""However, the humane script of Sieu Thoat finally persuaded them."" ""After shooting the last scene, Hue was hospitalised for a week. I am really touched by her efforts,"" Khuong added. Human dignity Once wealthy, the old man in the film becomes disconsolate after his son dies in an accident. His daughter-in-law then commits him to an institution for the insane. But he runs away because he cannot stand the loneliness there, and eventually becomes a pauper, living in a deserted temple. He makes a living by fishing plastic bags out of the river and sometimes finds dead bodies. The man prays for the souls of the bodies, including Thus, whose body he finds. A boy, orphaned and living on the streets, is also featured in the film. He threatens the old man, but the man helps him to become enlightened. ""By interweaving the lives of these three characters, the film aims to highlight the endurance of human dignity amid the confines of a cold and rigid society,"" Khuong said. ""Weve done the movie in HD technology, and needed about US$100,000 for post-production so we can widely distribute this at home and abroad,"" Khuong said. The film is expected to be released next month. Most of the revenue from the film will be given to children infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. HIV crusader Like a number of young women in the northern port town of Hai Phong, Hue was infected with HIV by her husband who was addicted to drugs. Her son was born in 2001 was not infected with HIV. In 2002, the 22-year-old tailor and mother of a baby son told her story to the public at a seminar on HIV/AIDS discrimination in Ha Noi. Her business suffered and her neighbours insulted her, but Hue became the public face of Me va Vo (Mothers and Wives), an HIV/AIDS support group established in Hai Phong by Norwegian NGO Nordic Assistance to Viet Nam (NAV) and the Hai Phong Peoples Committee. Hue manages the Hoa Phuong Do (Red Flamboyant) Cooperative which was established in 2003 as a meeting place where hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS come to share their hardships, get medical check-ups and other services to enable them to lead a healthy life. The cooperative runs a garment workshop in Kien An District, generating jobs for 15 HIV-infected people. It also operates a farm raising Geoduck clams on Cat Ba Island. Despite being busy, Hue spends some of her time taking part in contests on HIV/AIDS prevention. In 2006, she won a first prize with ""Happiness in Your Hand"" organised by the Viet Nam Red Cross Society and the Viet Nam Writers Association. She has been invited to speak at workshops on HIV/AIDS run by the Viet Nam General Confederation of Labour, the Ministry of Public Security and other organisations. She has also been presented with a certificate of merit by the Hai Phong Peoples Committee. Khuong said Hues true-life story had partially inspired the film and that her real-life tragedies had ""harmonised with the protagonists"". He also plans to make a documentary about Hues devotion to the local HIV/AIDS community. A graduate of the Film and Theatre College in 2006, director Vinh Khuong received support from the UNESCO Centre Cinema and Multimedia Company and Champa Resort to make the movie. Khuong is also director of the films Hoang Tuong (Illusion), Xanh Mai Doi Tra (Evergreen Tea Hill), and Sat Thu (Killer), all of which have won national awards. — VNS",Life & Style,"['patient', 'stars', 'hue', 'hiv', 'khuong', 'hivaids', 'man', 'viet', 'nam', 'hooker', 'hivpositive', 'phong', 'infected', 'film']","She is playing the role of a prostitute also infected with HIV, in a new film by director Vinh Khuong.

The event drew the participation of more than 3,500 representatives of State agencies, international organisations and local students. Speaking at the launching ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said that over the past 20 years, Viet Nam gained many successes in HIV/AIDS prevention, including lessons on how to cope with the disease and take control over it. He asked local authorities to continue creating favourable conditions for people to take part in activities to prevent and fight against HIV/AIDS so that no new HIV-infected cases will be reported. Phuc, who is also Chairman of the National Committee Against AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution, called on all local leaders and residents to continue raising awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention. State officials and cadres should be pioneers in the HIV/AIDS prevention campaign, with all families and social organisations taking care to support HIV infected people and reduce discrimination against patients, he said. He also called on international and non-Government organisations to join with Vietnamese people in taking more drastic measures against HIV/AIDS. Minister of Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien said the national action month against HIV/AIDS aimed to draw attention and increase community responsibilities. The programme was expected to raise awareness of the most vulnerable people living in remote and disadvantaged areas, as well as focus more attention on ethnic minority people, she said. In 2010, Viet Nam curbed the rate of HIV infections to 0.26 per cent of the population, lower than the target of 0.3 per cent set in the National Strategy of HIV/AIDS prevention. With this success, Viet Nam became the country with the lowest rate of HIV infections in the region, Tien said.",Society,"['action', 'national', 'awareness', 'nam', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'prevention', 'dinh', 'local', 'month', 'organisations', 'launched']","A health worker gives advice to a young couple about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases in northern Nam Dinh Province.

Building programmes and policies on HIV/AIDS education and prevention at the workplace has become increasingly necessary and returned benefits to the enterprises that implement them. Statistics of the Viet Nam Confederation of Labour show that nearly 700 cases of workers with HIV/AIDS have been reported nationwide. ""It’s a fact that many enterprises are fully aware of the danger of HIV/AIDS before it appears in their workplace,"" said Dang Hoa Ai, director of the confederation’s Centre for AIDS Prevention. ""But once a worker is found to have contracted HIV/AIDS, then there is discirmination towards him."" Information at a recent workshop co-ordinated by the labour confederation, the Academy for Educational Development, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA), and the Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, shows that the impact of HIV/AIDS can reduce labour productivity and increase production expenses. Heroine of Asia Pham Thi Hue, who joined the workshop as a representative of people living with HIV/AIDS, said that she and many other workers with HIV/AIDS always felt hurt when other people misunderstood that mere infection with the HIV virus means the victim is unhealthy or unable to work. She recalled many stories of discrimination towards them in reality. ""I hope that managers will give their workers more opportunities to learn about HIV/AIDS so that they can protect themselves and do not have the wrong impression of the condition."" Hue urged the expansion of the SMARTWork project, commenting that it would help reduce the number of HIV infections as well as ensure the rights of victims in the worksplace. The SMARTWork project, funded by the US Department of Labour, is an educational programme on HIV/AIDS implemented in six countries worldwide: the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Ukraine, Nigeria, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. Begun in 2003, the project was extended in June 2004 when US President George W Bush decided to support 15 countries in his US$15 billion emergency action plan for AIDS relief in which Viet Nam was the only Asian country selected. The project has been implemented in Thai Binh, Hai Phong, Quang Nam, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Dong Nai and HCM City. The project partners with MoLISA and has so far trained about 6,000 people in HIV/AIDS prevention while over 33,000 workers have become beneficiaries of the project. Four additional provinces of Vinh Phuc, Quang Ninh, Hai Duong and Hung Yen are also committed to join the project. Patrick Burke, project co-ordinator of SMARTWork Viet Nam, said that the porject achieved many successes in its first three years of implementation. ""The main reason is that we receive the co-operation of the Government, who does not ignore the problem and are always willing to take part to help our work be more effective,"" he said. ""Also, the commitment of the companies we’ve worked with are also an advantage when we implement the project."" Burke said that, among their plans, they had worked with a manufacturer in the US to produce 30 condom machines for about $190 each. When the machines arrive, they will work with a manufacturer in HCM City to produce more machines at cost of $120-130 each.",Society,"['smartwork', 'project', 'combat', 'moves', 'nam', 'machines', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'labour', 'workplace', 'aids', 'prevention', 'workers', 'work']","AIDS combat moves to workplace(25-07-2005)by Hong MinhHA NOI — HIV/AIDS can no longer be viewed as merely a problem of drug users and prostitutes as it affects all of society, including workers, enterprises and their families.

Earlier yesterday, the president of the Union of Friendship Associations, Vu Xuan Hong, presented Ryan with the ""For Peace and Solidarity Between Peoples"" insignia at a ceremony in Ha Noi. Hong expressed appreciation for the UN representative’s tireless effort and contributions to both international goals and Viet Nam’s socio-economic development, poverty reduction and the fight against epidemics. He wished Ryan success in his new position as assistant to the UN secretary general and as Annan’s special representative in Liberia. Jordan said he was honoured to receive the insignia, and added that he would use the valuable experience he gained in Viet Nam in his work in Africa. The same day, the Science and Education Commission under the Viet Nam Communist Party’s Central Committee also bestowed Ryan with a medallion in recognition of his contributions to science and education in Viet Nam during the ceremony. The honour is usually awarded only to scientists and managers of at least 20 years standing for their contributions in science and education. Viet Nam’s appreciation of Ryan’s contribution is shown by the fact that he has been in the country for less than nine years. These were the years when the United Nations and other donors had their biggest number of development support programmes in the country, said Science and Education Commission chairman Do Nguyen Phuong. They had helped with economic, legal and administrative reform, natural resource management, environment protection, poverty alleviation, human development training and technology transfer, he said. HIV/AIDS project The United Nations Development Programme and Sweden’s International Development Authority have pledged more than US$1.97 million to help Viet Nam fight HIV/AIDS. The intended project had stemmed from a Ryan idea as well as his friendly sentiment to the Vietnamese people before the immeasurable danger of HIV/AIDS. Viet Nam will contribute about $269,000 for the three-year project that will be financed by the money in northern Lang Son Province; central Khanh Hoa Province and southern An Giang Province. The renewed commitment by the two international aid agencies is embodied in a new agreement they signed with the Science and Education Commission in Ha Noi yesterday. The two will provide more than $1.97 million to help the Party’s leaders, ministries and agencies co-operate for the successful implementation of the national HIV/AIDS prevention and control strategy to 2010. It will be the first time that the Science and Education Commission and the Party’s Ideology and Culture Commission have collaborated with provincial Party commissions in a HIV/AIDS protection and prevention project of more than $2 million. ""It’s an honour because it shows their belief in us,"" said Science and Education Commission chairman Do Nguyen Phuong at the signing ceremony. ""But it also poses a big challenge."" Outgoing UNDP residential representative Jordan Ryan said effective leadership in mobilising the entire society was needed to defeat the epidemic. The personal involvement of leaders was also critical to the successful realisation of political commitments and policies so as to achieve such concrete results as: Reducing stigma and discrimination; Promoting the greater involvement of all including people living with HIV/AIDS and affected by HIV/AIDS in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and, Providing greater access for all people to quality information, education, and communication for behaviour change; treatment and care services.",Society,"['commission', 'nam', 'honoured', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'ryan', 'outgoing', 'development', 'science', 'united', 'nations', 'official', 'education', 'insignia']","Outgoing UN official honoured with insignia(15-12-2005)Party leader Nong Duc Manh (right) shakes hands with outgoing United Nations resident co-ordinator Jordan Ryan.

In the city, he became a male prostitute. Since then, he says: ""I seem to have fallen into hell."" One day, he met a man who belonged to one of the citys 14 community-based organisations supervised by the LIFE organisation under the Viet Nam Union of Science and Technology Association. The member of the M for M group gave him a condom and told him that he should receive free HIV testing at the consulting centre. At first, he was very angry but later he decided to visit the centre for the test. ""I was shocked to discover when I tested positive for HIV. I felt overwhelmed and fearful. Why me?"" he said. He called the member, who told him to go to an HIV outpatient care and treatment clinic in the city. The man also taught him how to prevent HIV transmission. Now that he has had treatment, the Vinh Long native feels that being HIV-positive is not a death sentence. ""My life started again when I joined the M for M group,"" he said. Nguyen Van Hoang, another member of M for M, said the groups members used many methods, including social networks to access gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) to spread knowledge of HIV-transmission prevention and provide condoms. They also work with medical facilities, with assistance from the citys AIDS Prevention Centre, to treat MSM or gays with HIV, and with local authorities to enhance prevention activities in the community.

Speaking at a conference today that summed up the initial results of HIV testing in the community and created a plan for the future, Võ Hải Sơn, an expert from the administration, said discrimination was the main factor keeping people from approaching centres to get tested for HIV. Many of the people suffering from HIV lived in remote areas with a difficult terrain, so travelling to centres for tests was difficult, he said. To address the problem, the administration ran a pilot programme for HIV testing in six provinces and cities, Nghệ An, Thanh Hóa, Điện Biên and Thái Nguyên, as well as Hà Nội and HCM City, in the 2015-17 period. It plans to expand the programme to districts with a high population of HIV sufferers in the 2017-20 period. Under the pilot programme, a number of activities were conducted. Medical workers provided mobile HIV tests in the community. Village-based medical workers and community organisations offered consultancy services on HIV tests. Training was given to the communes’ medical workers. The people receiving the tests included heroin addicts, their spouses and children, sex workers and homosexuals. Nguyễn Thúy Vân, an expert from the World Health Organisation, said that in the central province of Thanh Hóa, training for HIV test administration consultancy via village-based workers was conducted in August last year across 12 communes.

In the northern province of Thái Nguyên, 234 people were tested, and nine of them tested positive and had anti-retroviral therapy. Sơn said HIV tests in the community had helped medical workers give services to the right people and supply treatment immediately after getting positive test results.

The Viet Nam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) reported that out of 12.8 million employees, which represents 14.6 per cent of the total population and 28.2 per cent of the labour force, approximately 5,000 are drug users and 1,000 have contracted HIV. However, several officials and experts acknowledge that the realistic amount of drug users and HIV cases are much higher than what has been reported. ""If there was not such a high number of people on drugs or infected with HIV, productivity would increase and we would save a considerable amount of money,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong. ""The drug abuse problem among staff and workers in our country is getting more and more serious with around 5,000 employees using drugs and more than 1,000 infected with HIV,"" said VGCL Vice President Hoang Ngoc Thanh. The remarks were made at a conference, which focused on policies related to HIV, drugs and prostitution prevention, in Quang Ninh Province last weekend. The conference, hosted by the National Committee of HIV/AIDS prevention and drug and prostitution control, was attended by the committee’s chairman Trong, representatives from ministries, international non-governmental organisations, provincial People’s Committees, provincial confederations, national trade unions, economic groups and enterprises. Attendants at the conference all agreed that HIV/AIDS prevention was a national concern that could not be addressed without long-term engagement with the business community. ""We are aware that enterprises play an important role in HIV/AIDS prevention and drug and prostitution control,"" said chairman of Nam Trieu Ship Building Company’s Labour Union Nguyen Van Canh. Participants also acknowledged that drug addiction should be treated as a disease that could potentially affect anyone, and therefore individuals who struggled with addiction should not be discriminated against by the community. ""Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease that requires long-term treatment, which takes into consideration the biological, social and psychological aspect of the whole person,"" said advisor on drug abuse Kevin Mulvey. UNAIDS country director Eamonn Murphy said as many as nine out of 10 people living with HIV were adults in their most productive years. Two out of three people living with the disease go to work everyday. Studies have shown that people who receive treatment are more likely to have happier, healthier and more productive lives. He said HIV was a work-force issue and that the key populations at high risk in Viet Nam were of working age. Eamonn added that what was good for communities was good for business. A healthier labour force generated more spending power and a more developed economy. Therefore, effective HIV prevention helped to prevent production losses. Speaking at the workshop, business leaders were aware of the losses HIV had caused to their companies, as well as to the communities. Pham Minh Tuan, an employee at Ha Tu Coal Joint Stock Company in Quang Ninh Province, had previously been hopeless about the future due to his drug addiction. ""In 1992, I began using drugs. My job, life and family were seriously affected by my addiction. I was sure that I was going to lose my job,"" Tuan recalled. However, he was not dismissed and received support from his company to undergo treatment at a drug detoxification centre. After being treated, he was offered another job at the company as a driver. In time, he was able to regain the trust of his co-workers and was later nominated to be the head of the company’s driving team. Tuan now has a happy family and is actively contributing to the company’s development. Not everybody has been as lucky as Tuan. According to Deputy PM Trong, Viet Nam now has 350,000 enterprises with millions of workers and civil servants. However, the number of businesses that employ people who have been treated for drug addiction or HIV is relatively small.",Society,"['tackle', 'tuan', 'prostitution', 'companies', 'drug', 'hiv', 'nam', 'labour', 'addiction', 'hivaids', 'prevention', 'drugs']","Companies tackle drugs, prostitution(28-09-2009)QUANG NINH — Building policies and programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention, education and drug and prostitution control at the workplace has become an urgent task for businesses trying to retain their work force and increase their productivity.

"New law to fight AIDS by allowing condom sales at hotels, restaurants","A new law on HIV/AIDS should help prevent new infections by allowing hotels and restaurants to sell or provide free condoms, according to Government officials.",[],2006-08-10,vietnamnews.vn,"New law to fight AIDS by allowing condom sales at hotels, restaurants (10-08-2006) by Thanh Hai Chinese Movie Star Jackie Chan (standing centre) talks with HIV/AIDS sufferers at Phap Van pagoda, Thanh Tri District, Ha Noi, during his visit to Viet Nam in 2005.— VNS Photo Gia Vi. Ha Noi — A new law on HIV/AIDS should help prevent new infections by allowing hotels and restaurants to sell or provide free condoms, according to Government officials. Health experts expect that the law, which will come into effect on January 1, 2007, will be an effective step aiming to control the epidemic in Viet Nam in part, through for the first time allowing ""harm-reduction"" methods such as condom distribution and clean needles for drug users. ""The implementation of the law is a blow of steel from the Viet Nam Government to roll back the epidemic,"" said Deputy Director of the HIV/AIDS Prevention Department Chu Quoc An. However, some people living with HIV/AIDS still wonder how the new law would benefit them. ""Let’s wait until the day the new law comes into effect,"" said T., a member of Bright Futures Group (BFG), a self-help group for HIV-positive people in Ha Noi. Bright Futures works from a small house full of boxes of condoms, vitamins and brochures on HIV/AIDS prevention, near Nguyen Van Cu Road, Gia Lam District. This is where 200 people living with HIV/AIDS come to receive advice and medical aid or share experiences and information on issues relating to HIV/AIDS. T. is skinny and looks older than his 36 years. He doesn’t like people asking HIV-positive people about their past, as people living with HIV/AIDS are now most worried about their future. ""We can’t live in the past while we are struggling for our lives in the present,"" T. said. BFG is one of 13 groups in the Bright Future Network, with over 600 members who are people living with HIV/AIDS in the north. The group sells and provides at no cost more than 15,000 condoms to local motels and restaurants each month. BFG is now participating in a pilot project preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS in Duc Giang and Bo De communes in Long Bien District, Ha Noi. The programme, called ""Inns with condoms,"" has been running for nearly a year. Around 20 hotels in Bo De and a dozen in Duc Giang are BFG clients. However, delivery of condoms is only allowed under the pilot programme. Other hotels near those inns still refuse to buy condoms from the group, or buy them on the sly. H., a BFG member, said that they began to market condoms to hotels several years ago but their message was not welcome, because of a high degree of ""vigilance"" among hoteliers. Many people think that condoms are considered ‘forbidden’ in hotels in Viet Nam, because they can be used as evidence of prostitution. ""They drove me away when I brought condoms to their hotels, even though I knew that they often bought condoms from shops. They were afraid that I was an informer or secret police officer. Now they call me for condoms,"" H. said. Both authorities and the public support the idea of publicly delivering condoms to hotels as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV, which has killed more than 10,000 and threatens nearly 100,000 Vietnamese people. ""In my opinion, it will be best to legalise condoms in hotels. However, according to a draft of the decree that guides how to implement the new Law on HIV/AIDS, condoms may only be allowed in places approved under the framework of the anti-HIV/AIDS prog-ramme,"" Deputy Director of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Health Nguyen Huy Quang said.",Society,"['law', 'restaurants', 'fight', 'nam', 'condom', 'living', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'noi', 'aids', 'condoms', 'group', 'allowing', 'hotels', 'sales', 'programme']","New law to fight AIDS by allowing condom sales at hotels, restaurants(10-08-2006)by Thanh HaiChinese Movie Star Jackie Chan (standing centre) talks with HIV/AIDS sufferers at Phap Van pagoda, Thanh Tri District, Ha Noi, during his visit to Viet Nam in 2005.— VNS Photo Gia Vi.

Centre helps beat addictions,"Five years ago, Nguyen Huu Viet, a HIV-positive drug addict, went to the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in the northern province of Hai Phong.",['Minh Thi'],2011-06-22,vietnamnews.vn,"by Minh Thi HIV/AIDS patients take their meal at the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in Hai Phong City. The cash-strapped centre is struggling to cope with an influx of drug addicts. — VNS Photo Minh Thi HAI PHONG — Five years ago, Nguyen Huu Viet, a HIV-positive drug addict, went to the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in the northern province of Hai Phong. Viet said that he was then a ""terrible person"", a robber who stole to feed his addiction. Today, Viet is rebuilding his life and is now the director of a small private company. ""On the ridge between life and death, I now realise that life is priceless, and that I must make every effort to say no to drugs,"" he said. He urges addicts at the rehabilitation centre, also known as the Gia Minh Centre, to try their best to give up drugs, despite enormous temptations. ""Drugs will deprive you of your youth and blacken your names,"" Viet tells them. He is among the few addicts at Gia Minh who have fully managed to give up drugs. Pham Anh Hai, the centres deputy director, said the proportion of people who relapse after leaving rehabilitation centres is 80 to 90 per cent. The high percentage is among the many challenges facing the centre. At a meeting to commemorate the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on June 26 organised last Saturday by Hai Phong Communist Youth Union and Vietnam News Agencys Journalists Association, Nguyen Quang Toan, Gia Minh Centres director, said that treating addicts was difficult as no cures or procedures had been outlined. The centre also has to cope with limited financing . The Governments food subsidy for addicts was recently lifted from VND240,000 to VND360,000 ($17) per person per month, but this was still low considering the current high inflation rate, Hai said. Additionally, funds to buy personal belongings for inmates is only VND100,000 a month. The centre currently offers treatment to more than 1,200 people. Seventy per cent of addicts have criminal records and 50 per cent suffer from HIV infections. Of those with HIV, nearly 30 per cent also have AIDS. To manage them, there are only about 20 medical staff - and most of them are quite young. Hai, the centres deputy director, said that many of the staff left because of work pressure and of the high risk of HIV infection. On occasion, newly admitted addicts desperate for a ""fix"" became violent with staff in their attempts to escape. Lai Thi Hien, a nurse in her early twenties, once had scissors pressed under her neck by an addict. Nguyen Thi Trang, Hiens colleague, was once slashed on the hand by an addict. She lived in fear for days after the incident. ""I was very scared and cried a lot,"" said Trang. Despite all difficulties, they stay committed to their jobs. But some families do not want their daughters to remain on the job. ""My family do not want me to stay in this environment because they are very worried about the infection risk,"" said Nguyen Thi Phuong, who has been working at the centre since its establishment in 2004. Toan said the centres staff were gladdened when some of their patients managed to give up drugs. Vu Duc Cuong, 28, who went to the centre in 2006 and only recently succeeded in giving up drugs, said he wanted to settle down and find a good job and a wife. It was difficult because of social discrimination and the prevalence of drug sellers near his home, he said. Like Cuong, dozens of the centres patients who managed to give up also want to rebuild their lives. Some stay at the centre, helping with the treatment of HIV-positive patients or making handicrafts, traditional medical remedies and pottery. ""The money collected from the sales is spent on the centres arts performances, sports activities and upgrading facilities,"" Hai said. — VNS",Society,"['director', 'patients', 'nguyen', 'drug', 'centres', 'beat', 'addicts', 'minh', 'centre', 'staff', 'helps', 'hai', 'addictions']","by Minh ThiHIV/AIDS patients take their meal at the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in Hai Phong City.

Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long said the number of new HIV cases annually rises above 10,000. He added the number of cases caused by unsafe sexual activities has increased, which meant that more women and children risk getting the virus. Punishing people who are most at risk simply doesnt work – it doesnt reduce drug use, it doesnt reduce sex work and it doesnt reduce HIV, according to Tony E.Lisle, country director of UNAIDS Viet Nam. He argued that drug users need clean needles and evidence-based treatments for drug addiction. Sex workers need condoms, regular health checks and protection against exploitation. ""Many of these individuals are rejected by society for committing so-called ""social evils"". And when society rejects them, it is very difficult to reach them with health care and social services.

A centre survey conducted recently in 60 out of 64 cities and provinces nationwide showed that many local officials remain unalarmed by the threat of HIV/AIDS and have yet to implement information campaigns to prevent the spread of the disease. The survey, aimed to evaluate local implementation of the seventh Party Central Committee’s instruction on HIV/AIDS prevention, found that only 10 provinces believed the local HIV/AIDS situation was at a critical level; 45 others responded that the local HIV/AIDS situation was at a moderate level. In Quang Ninh and Khanh Hoa provinces, which have the highest number of HIV-infected persons in the country, 26.3 per cent of local officials said that HIV/AIDS only affected people in high-risk groups, such as prostitutes and drug users, rather than themselves or their family members. More than 98 per cent of survey respondents in these provinces knew about the disease and its methods of transmission, but only 35.4 per cent were familiar with the measures to prevent infection. In the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces, which having the highest number of districts and communes have people living with HIV/AIDS in the country, 13 provinces said the local outbreak danger was only moderate. Many local leaders agreed in the survey that it is necessary to help people living with HIV/AIDS to integrate into the community and build useful lives, as well as prevent the spread of infection to their family members and community. While survey respondents agreed that the names of people living with HIV/AIDS must be kept confidential in order to prevent social stigma, they also believed it is necessary to inform family and relevant sectors in order to prevent the spread of infection. Many are in favour of distributing condoms and syringes to individuals in high-risk groups. The prevention of HIV/AIDS is seen as a priority programme of the Party, but many localities have yet to invest resources in the effort, relying upon and expecting funding from the State budget, said the centre, adding that the capacity of workers specialising in HIV/AIDS prevention in many localities remains weak.

Almost half of all HIV patients in Việt Nam get treatment allowing them to enjoy a longer and productive life and take care of their families, she told a conference on policies for HIV/AIDS prevention held in HCM City yesterday. “This means that more than half of people with HIV who very much need treatment do not get it.” With still around 11,000 new HIV infections and 8,000 AIDS-related deaths every year, Việt Nam continues to face a major public health threat, she said. “Though every new HIV infection is preventable, especially mother-to-child transmission, every year a few hundred Vietnamese infants are born with HIV.” Young people’s knowledge of HIV remains limited, and thus the younger generation, whom Việt Nam’s future relies on, is still much at risk of HIV and progress could be reversed, she warned. The HIV epidemic and response are uneven across the country and, evidence shows, have become more serious in certain areas and among some key populations, she said. This complex dynamic requires continued determination and a well-adapted response, she said. “Investing in the HIV response will not only ensure that no one is left behind and at risk without access to HIV information and services, but will also enable more people living with HIV to be part of the national solutions towards ending AIDS.” Việt Nam would be able to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, she said. “Though we will continue to support Việt Nam to mobilise external support, in the context of fast reduction of donor funding for HIV due to Việt Nam’s strong economic development and with a view to further ensure the sustainability of the HIV response, HIV should be integrated in the national and provincial socio-economic development plans.” Nguyễn Hoàng Long, head of the Việt Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said in the first six months of this year 4,541 new HIV infections had been detected, raising the total number in the country to 209,591. Of them, 56 per cent are getting the anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy, he said. The total number of AIDS patients is 90,190. Nine provinces and cities are yet to complete a project on allocating finance for HIV/AIDS prevention, he said. It is expected that health insurance would cover ARV drugs from 2019, and the ratio of people with HIV/AIDS who have insurance increased from 64 per cent last February to 76 per cent in June, he said.

The VNP+ said it and other organisations in the region were aware that the US had declared war on generic AIDS medicines through free trade negotiations with countries in the region. It expected the prices of medicines for HIV, TB, hepatitis C and other major diseases to increase as a result. At the seventh round of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) negotiations which wrapped up in HCM City last week, the US had taken intellectual property demands beyond what had been agreed under the WTOs Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the VNP+ said. Do Dang Dong, national co-ordinator of the VNP+, said the drug prices would rise because under IP rules, all countries would have to import them from manufacturers, mostly American. The negotiations which came barely 10 days after the United Nations High Level Meeting on HIV and AIDS in New York where all countries including the US committed to ""ensure that intellectual property rights provisions in trade agreements do not undermine these existing flexibilities, as confirmed by the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health."" The Vietnamese generics industry, with support from the Government, was taking the lead in providing affordable treatment for hepatitis-C, Noah Metheny of the Thai AIDS Treatment Action Group said. However, US drug giant Roche is challenging Viet Nams generic production of pegylated interferon and now the TPPA negotiations are threatening to impose even greater legal barriers that may prevent similar attempts by the country to ensure generic production of key medicines,"" according to Metheny. Dong said:""I wonder if President [Barack] Obama and Secretary [Hillary] Clinton realise that the US trade representative is currently demanding that Viet Nam change its laws in ways that would prevent affordable generic production of new AIDS medicines."" For many HIV-positive drug users in the Asian region who also have hepatitis-C, Viet Nam offers the best hope for supplying generic pegylated interferon, the costly medicine used to treat hepatitis-C, according to the VNP+. Pegylated interferon has been patented in India and Indian generic companies are reluctant to produce it. The TPPA negotiations will not only make it difficult for Viet Nam and Malaysia to emulate the Indian example, they will in fact mandate that these countries grant patents on small changes made to existing medicines. Peter Maybarduk of the US group Public Citizen agreed: ""The US seems obsessed with maximising intellectual property and favouring the big drug companies, even if it leads to low-quality patents that do nothing for innovation and block access to lifesaving treatment.""

Prejudice hinders reintegration,"Less than a fifth of people from vulnerable groups including former drug addicts, sex workers and people affected by HIV are able to access loans in order to rebuild their lives.",[],2013-11-01,vietnamnews.vn,"Former drug users practise on industrial textile machines at a rehabilitation centre in Ha Noi. Only 17 per cent of people from vulnerable groups such as former drug addicts, sex workers and HIV carriers are able to access loans to find work and rebuild their lives. — VNA/VNS Photo Dinh Tran HA NOI (VNS) — Less than a fifth of people from vulnerable groups including former drug addicts, sex workers and people affected by HIV are able to access loans in order to rebuild their lives. The demand for loans among these people is high, with nearly 86 per cent having expressed the need, but added they are often hampered by prejudice. Also, they have to struggle to find work in the face of workplace discrimination. The statistics come from a new survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA). Seven provinces and cities throughout the country were canvassed, including Ha Noi, HCM City, Nghe An and Can Tho. The survey received nearly 1,550 responses in July this year from former drug addicts, sex workers and people affected by HIV, including those with HIV or a spouse, parent or child of those with HIV. Le Duc Hien, deputy director of the Department for the Prevention of Social Evils, said the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs will draft a decision for a policy to increase access to loans for people from these vulnerable communities and submit it to the Prime Minister for approval within the year. Hien said helping people from vulnerable groups was very important as it would not only directly help these people but also help their families improve their lives and help to contribute to the common social order and community development. ""They must not be left alone,"" he emphasised. Accessing vocational training and finding stable jobs was another major issue for the respondents, with nearly 58 per cent stating a desire to receive vocational training, but only over 14 per cent said they had been offered help in seeking training or finding jobs. The MOLISA survey reveals that just over 7 per cent of the survey respondents are university graduates, while the rest had only graduated from high school or lower levels. An anonymous respondent to the MOLISA survey said that having a history of being a drug addict in the past, he found himself a very unattractive candidate for companies offering work. ""Vocational training schools and companies give us many excuses for not accepting us,"" he said. While nearly 70 per cent of respondents said they are working, only 18 per cent of them earned VND3-5 million (US$140-240) a month and 57 per cent earned only VND1-3 million ($47-140). Because of poor health, lack of professional experience, limited educational background and their own sense of inferiority, respondents said they preferred doing seasonal jobs and freelancing (39 per cent) or decide to start a small businesses (56 per cent). Only 13 per cent said they wanted to work for a company as a full time employee. According to a report by the Department for Prevention of Social Evils operating under MOLISA, social discrimination, limited educational background and sometimes poor health are reasons making these groups find it difficult in accessing finance to rebuild their lives. The report also highlighted the Government only has a policy to offer loans towards poor households and there is no specific policy to offer loans towards these vulnerable groups. While the risk of offering loans to the groups seems high, MOLISA survey revealed that in reality, over 79 per cent of those who successfully borrowed loans had also managed to repay the loans. The Department for Prevention of Social Evils said support from both local and central Governments and from social organisations should be increased to help such vulnerable people. The support should be made through a range of measures such as promoting empowering legal policies, increasing professional consultation, raising job placement activities, promoting media coverage to reduce social discrimination and promoting access to loans for vulnerable people. The Department added that the Viet Nam Bank for Social Policies, which was responsible for offering financial support towards special groups of people, must work to create a more favourable and helpful environment at a local level for those from vulnerable groups. — VNS",Society,"['social', 'reintegration', 'molisa', 'work', 'drug', 'vulnerable', 'cent', 'loans', 'groups', 'hinders', 'help', 'prejudice', 'survey']","The demand for loans among these people is high, with nearly 86 per cent having expressed the need, but added they are often hampered by prejudice.

Community sites help drug addicts access treatment services,"Five pilot sites in the city were set up with staff who have professional and technical training offered by the city’s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs and the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI).",[],2019-01-05,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY – A 51-year-old former drug addict in HCM City’s District 1, who has been receiving a daily methadone treatment at a local health centre, now has a stable income as a motorbike taxi driver. The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he received treatment from the District 1 Health Centre thanks to advice from a Community Consulting Site in the district’s Phạm Ngũ Lão Ward. Methadone, a synthetic opioid, can be used to treat severe pain or opiate addictions, especially addiction to heroin. “I was addicted for many years. I visited addiction treatment centres many times, but always relapsed,” the man said. He began receiving assistance from the Community Consulting Site in early 2016 from its social workers who work as volunteers. Another man, a 58-year-old from District 8, who tested positive for HIV, has also received support from a local Community Consulting Site. In September 2016, he returned home from the Phú Văn Addiction Treatment and Social Welfare Establishment in Bình Thạnh District, but became more ill. “At that time, I was very afraid of returning home because of my disease,” he said. In 2017, he contacted the People’s Committee in District 8’s Ward 8 where a Community Consulting Site is located. He later became a volunteer at the site. He has encouraged other drug addicts and people with HIV/AIDS to visit the site for consultations and treatment. The consulting sites in District 8’s Ward 8 and District 1’s Phạm Ngũ Lão Ward are two of five pilot sites in the city with staff who have professional and technical training offered by the city’s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs and the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI). The SCDI is an NGO that aims to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable populations, including drug users, sex workers, and PLHIV (people living with HIV), their partners and their children. The staff at the consulting sites are knowledgeable about hepatitis C, health insurance, and methadone. Between 2017 and 2018, staff and volunteers at the five sites provided consulting to 879 people and free health insurance cards to six people. They persuaded 42 addicts to accept community-based treatment and introduced 72 other addicts to methadone treatment at health centres in the city. They also helped 22 former addicts find jobs and six others to access loans totalling VNĐ110 million (US$4,746), and connected local sponsors to help support addicts with financial difficulties. Huỳnh Thanh Khiết, deputy director of the city’s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said the city’s community consulting sites play an important role in reducing the number of addicts brought to addiction treatment establishments. “The city plans to reduce the number of these addicts by 6 per cent by 2020,” Khiết said, adding that the city has nearly 12,000 addicts being treated at these establishments. Of these, 70 per cent live in the city. “The city’s total number of managed addicts is more than 18,000,” he added. Nguyễn Tuấn Anh, deputy head of the city’s Social Evils Prevention Division under the department, said that his division would work with local people’s committees to allocate funds for these community consulting sites so they can improve their operations. “The city now has 125 community consulting sites,” Anh said. Lê Thị Loan, head of the social work team at the Community Consulting Site in District 4’s Ward 8, said the shortage of funds was the main barrier to operating well. “When an addict wants to give up but there is no supportive environment or assistance from local authorities, they can relapse easily,” she said. Nguyễn Hoài Hương, deputy director of SCDI, said the consulting sites would help addicts access community-based treatment “That is why SCDI worked with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs to set up these sites,” Hương said.–VNS",Society,"['social', 'access', 'community', 'consulting', 'services', 'site', 'citys', 'drug', 'district', 'local', 'sites', 'help', 'addicts', 'treatment']","He began receiving assistance from the Community Consulting Site in early 2016 from its social workers who work as volunteers.

Early intervention can prevent HIV spread,"Early intervention and treatment can almost completely prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, a workshop heard in Vung Tau on Monday.",[],2012-12-26,vietnamnews.vn,"BA RIA-VUNG TAU (VNS)— Early intervention and treatment can almost completely prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, a workshop heard in Vung Tau on Monday. If pregnant women with HIV get early access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, the transmission rate would be zero per cent, Assoc Prof Dr Bui Duc Duong, deputy head of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said, This means their babies would be healthy like normal ones, he told the workshop that reviewed a project on HIV/AIDS Prevention in Viet Nam funded by the World Bank. Generally, early intervention and treatment would curtail transmission by 96 per cent, he said. For this, more information would need to be disseminated to help people understand that being infected with HIV is not a death sentence, he added. A report by the administration showed that the number of new HIV-infected people has reduced since 2007, going down from 30,846 to 17,780 last year. In the first nine months of this year 8,560 people tested positive. As of September the number of people living with HIV was 206,435. Of them 59,206 have AIDS while 62,073 have so far died of the disease. Dien Bien Province continued to top the country in the ratio of HIV-infected people, with 992.8 per 100,000 population. It was followed by HCM City with 665 and Thai Nguyen Province with 579. In the last five years the number of HIV-infected people aged between 30 and 39 nationwide has been on an upward trend. Last year they accounted for 43 per cent of newly infected people. There has been an increase in the ratio of sexual transmission in the first nine months of this year to 46.4 per cent from 42.3 per cent last year. Most of the incidence was in the Cuu Long (Mekong) River Delta and the south-eastern region. Infections transmitted through blood fell to 41.3 per cent from 46.2 per cent last year, and was mostly found in the northern region. New infections among men who have sex with men have been rising in the last two years. Duong warned of the high risk of HIV infection among ethnic minorities, but said it was difficult to prevent in northern mountain provinces like Dien Bien, Lai Chau, and Lao Cai because of peoples habit of giving themselves opiate shots to relieve pain. More than 69,880 people with HIV use ARV. This number is likely to double by 2015. ""The steady decrease in new HIV infections is a result of assistance from international organisations like the World Bank,"" Duong said. The project on HIV/AIDS prevention, with funding of US$65 million, has been carried out in 32 provinces and cities. Authorities have handed out 21 million syringes to addicts and 48 million condoms to prostitutes for free.

All sectors should co-operate with each other to prevent such discrimination, said Landon Kuester of Alpert Medical School of the US-based Brown University. Sharing experiences on education for addicts in rehabilitation centres as well as for former drug addicts, Landon said biased behavior would undermine efforts to minimize the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as efforts to help former drug addicts reintegrate into mainstream society. Being ostracized by the society will make people living with HIV/AIDS depressed, isolate them from the community and break relationships with their own families and community, he said. They lose their desire to continue treatment, worsening the situation, he stressed. Experts called for more effective activities and programmes to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS that would dispel irrational beliefs about the disease and how it spreads. Healthcare policies should ensure equality in accessing treatment for all segments of the society, they added. In schools, teachers should educate students on how to access accurate information on HIV/AIDS and work to prevent prejudices against people living with the virus. At workplaces, managers should create many chances for people living with HIV/AIDS to work and encourage fellow employees to welcome them into their fold.

Most HIV/AIDS sufferers are afraid of public opinion while patients who want the medicine must reveal their identity and go under supervision at hospitals, Thanh said. Because of the requirements, many patients don’t seek hospital treatment. ""Another reason is that it costs nearly a million dong (US$55) for tests before patients are supplied with ARV medicine. Most are poor,"" Thanh said. Moc Chau District, in the northern mountainous province of Son La, is a disease hot spot. The first HIV case was diagnosed in 1999. By last month, the total was 560, of whom 100 had fully-blown AIDS. HIV/AIDS have spread to 23 of the district’s 27 communes and towns, home to more than 2,000 heroin addicts. Statistics have not been compiled on sex-workers’ numbers but the centre provides more than 100 with free condoms, said Thanh. The district People’s Council chairman, Luong Van Chua, said the number of HIV patients in the province in general and in Moc Chau in particular increased because of a lack of basic knowledge. There were few programmes for patients. Officials from the local people’s committee, the women association and the centre have formed a guidance board to find ways to stop the disease spreading, Chua said. The district authorities have sought financial support from domestic and international organisations to help HIV patients fund their treatment, he said. The district holds training courses to improve the professional knowledge of medical workers. ""We ask village patriarchs, who are looked up to by locals, to help us in requesting residents to quit heroin,"" said Chua. Authorities put special importance on educational efforts on the disease through documentary films, panels, posters and leaflets in minority languages, he said. ""Since 2007, twice a year we have run campaigns to spread knowledge on preventing and fighting HIV/AIDS. We consider the campaigns our district’s cultural-social events,"" he said. The district’s junior secondary and high school students receive guidance on HIV/AIDS, sex education and reproductive health.",Society,"['medicines', 'patients', 'thanh', 'hiv', 'conditions', 'hivaids', 'medicine', 'districts', 'chau', 'rules', 'aids', 'limit', 'district', 'free']","Rules limit free AIDS medicines(16-07-2009)HIV/AIDS patients get treatment at a centre in Mai Chau District in nothern Hoa Binh Province.

Early anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment will be launched next year, Tieu Thi Thu Van, head of the administrative office of HCM Citys AIDS Committee told a seminar held yesterday in HCM City. The early treatment will be offered in all medical units, including private ones, to 2,500 patients, or 20 per cent of the total number of HIV/AIDS patients, by the end of 2015. The aim is to have early ARV treatment to cover 90 per cent of infected persons by 2025 in order to eliminate all cases in the 2025-30 period. The number of ARV patients is expected to reach 26,000 by 2015, from an estimated 23,000 patients in 2013. By 2015, the average number of patients per outpatient clinic is expected to be between 600 and 1,000. This year, at least 5,200 patients were newly registered at more than 30 outpatient clinics and nearly 3,000 patients were given ARV treatment. HIV/AIDS prevention in HCM City has received 90-93 per cent of its financial support from international organisations. However, such support is expected to fall, but the need is still high, which poses challenges for HIV/AIDS-prevention activities in the city, she said. Le Truong Giang, chairman of the HCM City Public Health Association, said that funding for HIV/AIDS prevention programmes would rely on the State budget, health insurance and private funds, as international aid is falling sharply. Funding resources should be used efficiently, Giang said, adding that funding from the Government and international organisations must be focused on activities for target groups, such as pregnant women, high-risk people and patients infected with hepatitis and tuberculosis. AIDS activities for other targetted groups will be assisted by private sources of support. ""Expanding HIV counseling and testing to detect HIV-infected cases early is the first action to end the spread of the disease here,"" Giang said. HIV-infected people ""live with HIV, but die by co-infection"", he said, adding that harm-reduction intervention should be targetted at those people with the highest behavioral risk. Co-infections can come with HIV transmission (via blood, sexual relations or from mother to fetus). It is often seen with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which evolve quietly and thus get less attention compared with HIV, he said. — VNS",Society,"['lower', 'arv', 'moves', 'international', 'patients', 'city', 'hcm', 'private', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'numbers', 'prevention', 'number', 'treatment']","HCM CITY (VNS) — Anti-retroviral therapy treatment will be expanded, and prevention and harm-reduction measures increased to reduce the number of HIV/AIDS cases in HCM City, experts have said.

The Asia Development Bank will support the project with an additional $550,000. Launched last month, the five-year project was expected to bring direct benefits to young people in high-risk groups including drug users and prostitutes. The project’s first phase would be carried out in Cam Khe District and the city of Viet Tri, areas with the highest concentration of people living with HIV. As of December, the province reported 1,181 people living with HIV, of whom 267 had progressed to symptoms of AIDS and 198 have died. There have been 121 new cases reported this year. However, due to the limited provincial budget, only about 4,000 people in high-risk groups are tested each year. Ngo Khang Cuong, director of Education and Communication Department under the National Committee for Population, Family and Children, said the project would bring more opportunities for people living with HIV/AIDS to find employment, as well as lessen community discrimination. Cuong, who is also director of the project, said, ""Society must not only express sympathy but also create conditions for them to have job. . . . Their bravery and optimism in life along with the community’s support all is a strong hedge against discrimination."" At the launching ceremony, the chairwoman of the National Committee for Population, Family and Children, Phan Thi Hanh Nguyen, noted that the province had the second-largest population among the eleven provinces of the northeastern region and great potential in commerce, tourism, services, and cultural exchanges. However, she said, it was faced with the dangers of the spread of social evils, including HIV/AIDS. Drug addicts using needles account for fully 79 per cent of HIV/AIDS cases in the province, but experts worried that there was an increasing trend of people contracting the virus through sexual intercourse. Compounding the problem was a provincial unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent, equivalently to about 14,300 persons out of work, many of them young people, the highest-risk group for engaging in behaviours that may result in HIV infection, said Nguyen. The province has an increasing migrant population, as well, with 25,000 arriving annually to seek work, eight per cent in the 18-30 age group. Cam Khe District, where thousands of young migrants have gathered, turned up the first case of HIV infection in the province and was struggling to prevent a spread of the epidemic. Some communes report as many as 30 cases per thousand people, a high rate compared to nationwide. The primary source of HIV infection was identified as young people returning to the area after working outside the province. Meanwhile, clubs and support groups have sprung up in the province to help support persons living with HIV/AIDS. The dynamic operation of clubs such as Vi suc khoe hanh phuc cua ban ( For your health and happiness) and Ban giup ban ( Friends helping friends) has enabled people living with the virus and their families overcome difficulties and integrate into society.",Society,"['project', 'provincial', 'province', 'young', 'aimed', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'population', 'prevention', 'aids', 'tho', 'youth', 'launches', 'support', 'phu']","Phu Tho launches AIDS prevention project aimed at provincial youth(05-04-2007)A nurse gives a lesson in HIV/AIDS prevention in Thanh Thuy District, in the northern province of Phu Tho. — VNA/VNS Photo Huu OaiPHU THO — The northern province of Phu Tho has allocated nearly US$300,000 from the local budget to carry out a new HIV/AIDS Prevention Project among provincial youth.

HCM CITY — HCM City has achieved great success in combating HIV/AIDS in the two decades since it reported the countrys first case, but more efforts are needed, a health official said. Speaking at the opening of a photo exhibition depicting the fight against HIV at the Youth Cultural House on Saturday, Dr Le Truong Giang, deputy head of the HCM City AIDS Committee, hailed the efforts to protect people from the disease. Giang, who is also deputy head of the city Department of Health, said that in 1995 WHO had warned there would be 200,000 people with HIV in HCM City in 2000. ""But now, a decade later, the city only has around 40,000 patients and around 8,000 people have died since 2000,"" Giang said. ""After 20 years of combating the disease non-stop, we have achieved great success in preventing its spread in the wider community,"" he said. The city has a programme to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to their unborn children. ""In Viet Nam only in HCM City is it successful, with 150 children saved each year,"" he said. The free anti-retroviral treatment offered to every HIV/AIDS patient has also been very successful, helping save an estimated 10,000 patients from possible death, according to Giang. In the early days of the epidemic, the fatality rate was pretty high, with 2,000 people dying as recently as five years ago. But the number has now fallen to 600 a year. Though the rate of infection among drug users and sex workers peaked in 2001 and 2002 at 80 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, Giang admitted that drug use and prostitution remained a problem, with drug users appearing to get younger. HIV transmission between men who have sex with men was becoming a great concern and this group would be the focus of the citys upcoming campaign, he said.

VN-American swaps body building for community building,"Amazin LêThi, a former professional bodybuilder with a global career spanning over 20 years, has shifted her focus to community work, hoping to",[],2017-04-13,vietnamnews.vn,"by Hồng Vân Amazin LêThi, a former professional bodybuilder with a global career spanning over 20 years, has shifted her focus to community work, hoping to ""give back"" some of what she got over the years from her native and adopted countries and communities. LêThi is the first internationally published Vietnamese health and fitness author, advocate for the rights of HIV/AIDS patients and global ambassador for Athlete Ally and Việt Nam Relief Services. No longer competing as a natural bodybuilder, LêThi is now focusing on the entertainment, health and fitness industry, and her community work. “My great passion is giving back to my community by utilising my different skills,” she tells Vietnam News. By July, LêThi will launch a flagship sports, education and leadership programme in Hải Phòng city for LGBTQ youth and kids affected by HIV/AIDS. The programme is co-organised by her local partner HIV/AIDS advocate Phạm Thị Huệ, the US and Dutch embassies, as well as businesses and organisations. “The main premise of this is creating an opportunity for kids to have fun, given that they all have difficult lives, learn necessary life skills and business skills for them to be connected with businesses locally and globally so that we can fast track them on educational and career development,” said LêThi. She hopes the programme will be launched nationally by 2018. “The LGBTQ movement has progressed so much in the last six years, but LGBTQs are still the most marginalised people. It is important that Việt Nam have a global voice and that its stories are shared so that the global community does not forget our stories and our needs,” said LêThi. LêThi has been engaged in community work for over twenty years. In the US, she has been involved in activities with the Asian American and Vietnamese community. In 2014, LêThi was the first international HIV advocate invited to Italy to speak at a national conference about AIDS in the Asian community. LêThi also advised the White House Initiative on Asian American Pacific Islanders, and on Asian youth issues that include discrimination of LGBTs, bullying and racism. This year, LêThi and her organisation became advisors to the New York City Department of Education and LGBTQ Advisory Council on Asian youth issues. She is also due to give three keynote speeches this year to amplify the Asian voice in New York, Chicago and Atlanta, where she has also been collaborating with the state and city on Asian youth issues. Asian youths globally are bullied the most out of all ethnic groups, and LGBTQs are bullied the most, according to LêThi, who points out that people tend to pick on people with weaknesses or those different from the majority. ""As a society, we don’t really understand about these marginalised people, what it’s like to feel different within yourself,"" she says. “So I will work hard on awareness.” Raising a voice on these issues, helping such youth find work, empowering them to be leaders - this will help to shift them from being barely tolerated to being accepted, she believes. Empowerment mission LêThi is a transracial adoptee, spending some time in Australia and now dividing hert ime between Europe and US. “Being an Asian living in a foreign community, I suffered lots of bullying, both verbally and physically in school and in society. “When I was small, the Vietnamese in Australia had a bad image. Our community lived in a bad part of town and I was always told we were thieves, drug dealers and the only reason Asian youth travelled to the richer areas of town was to steal from people. “Yet people had no idea Vietnamese parents worked very hard to send their kids to better schools abroad so they could have a decent education,” she says. Considering sports as ""an amazing social platform bringing people together"", LêThi decided to pursue bodybuilding at the age of six. “Sports isn’t based on what one looks like but how good an athlete one is. It gave me confidence to stand up to bullying in school and a sense of community,” said LêThi. “As a leader and a woman, I think of myself when I was six. I didn’t have any female role model, a Vietnamese role model to look at. And now I’m in a position, on a global platform, where I can be a role model for a six-year-old somewhere. “Young Vietnamese girls need to have a role model in the community so they know who they want to become, who they can be, and more importantly, that their dream is valid. It is important to let them know that belief is possible so that’s why I’m always advocating for girls to make sure they get access to education,” said LêThi. In 2015, LêThi launched her organisation, Amazin LêThi Foundation at Vietpride with the mission to empower and inspire the most vulnerable citizens. Specifically, the organisation worked with LGBTQ youth and those affected by HIV/AIDS through a range of educational, sporting, leadership and mentoring programmes, as well as to campaign against social stigma and discrimination. “The organisation is my own vision to give back to the Vietnamese and global community,” said LêThi. A heart towards motherland She first came back to Việt Nam over a decade ago. LêThi has travelled back to Việt Nam every year since, and sometimes four times a year. “I had tears of joy as the plane was landing. I truly felt like I was coming home, and everytime I arrive back home to Việt Nam I have that same feeling. “I’m so proud of my Vietnamese heritage and culture, and can now see there are many amazing Vietnamese female leaders in our community, and I’m honoured to be one of them,” LêThi says. LêThi is in the process of searching for her biological parents. “Everyday I think of how proud they would be to know what I have achieved in my life and the person I have become. “The struggles that I have gone through in my life shaped me into the person I am today. This is why I use my platform to inspire, empower and educate Vietnamese youths, encourage them to believe in themselves and their dreams so that one day they can be leaders and mentors in their community,” LêThi sums up.

A former war veteran, Nhu is head of Ward 21s Phat Tam HIV/AIDS Prevention Division in HCM Citys Binh Thanh District. As part of her job, she gives advice to mothers about HIV transmission prevention at the districts Gia Dinh Peoples Hospital. Babies born to mothers with HIV are tested for HIV one month after delivery. They are then given another test four months later, said Nhu, who works for the citys AIDS Prevention Committee, considered to be the most effective in the country, according to the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control. After delivery, the babies are given the HIV medicine zidovunine, but if results from the two tests show that HIV has been transmitted, they will receive another type of drug that will help them live healthier lives. Nhu, 61, a native of Long An Province in the Mekong Delta region who moved to the city in 1990, is well-known for her devotion and care of people with HIV or AIDS. She began hearing about people and children with HIV/AIDS living in the ward when she was a member of the Womens Union in Ward 21. One young man, she said, was rumoured to have HIV, so she contacted the family to encourage him to take tests. As a result, the son was willing to go to the hospital, where he tested positive for HIV with a low CD4 cell count, the type of white blood cells that fight infection. He was immediately provided anti-retroviral ARV treatment, and is now healthy and married, Nhu said. After she introduced many of these local residents to the citys anti-retroviral ARV treatment programme, the citys HIV/AIDS Prevention Committee offered her training as a social worker. She began to work for them in 2008. A resident with HIV who lives in Nhus Ward 21 calls Nhu a ""lifebuoy"". ""I was worried when I became pregnant, and I didnt know if I should have an abortion. So I met Nhu for counselling and she persuaded me to take part in the citys programme on prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission,"" Nguyen Thi Thanh Thao, who has HIV, said. ""Thanks to her counselling, my son tested negative for HIV,"" Thao said, who now works in Nhus HIV prevention division. The Peoples Committees in her ward and district have honoured Nhu with medals for her contributions to HIV prevention. Along with official recognition, people with HIV/AIDS in her ward often send messages to express love and thanks to her, motivating her to continue counselling people with HIV. Nhu said that a few women with HIV had wanted to abandon their newly delivered babies. ""I encouraged them to keep the babies,"" she said. But some of the mothers cannot be convinced. Nhu said on a trip to visit relatives in Vinh Long Province, she received a call from a woman at Gia Dinh Peoples Hospital in HCM City. She had just delivered a baby and wanted Nhu to find a welfare centre for the newborn. Though Nhu urged her to keep the baby, the mother said she could not afford to raise the child. Still in Vinh Long, Nhu called the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Committee, which gave her the name of Tam Binh Welfare Centre for children with HIV/AIDS in HCM City.

Healthcare sector strives to control epidemic,Healthcare sector set measures to fulfil the targets set for this year along with warning of medical experts on drug resistance situation of the country,[],2019-01-16,vietnamnews.vn,"HÀ NỘI – This year, the healthcare sector aims to reduce death rates caused by diseases and epidemics to increase life expectancy. That was the key objective discussed by the healthcare sector during an online conference held on Tuesday. The sector would focus on improving capacity and performance to help develop a fair, effective, quality and sustainable system to meet high demands of people. This year, the sector has to fulfill two targets set by the National Assembly and the Government of ratio of 2.7 hospital beds per 10,000 persons, and 88.1 per cent of people buying medical insurances, heard the conference. In terms of preventive healthcare activity, the sector would strive to achieve early detection and control epidemics to reduce death rates by infectious disease as well as closely supervise and prevent infectious plagues at international border gates to avoid disease coming into the country. It continued to make efforts to ensure safe vaccinations with the rate of 95 per cent of children vaccinated, ensure adequate vaccine supply, and develop different types of vaccination services for people. The Health Ministry plans to co-operate with the Education and Training Ministry to enhance capacity of school clinics, supervise school hygiene and control school-related diseases. Testing activities to detect HIV-infected people would be expanded and focus on key areas and high-risk groups in prisons and mountainous areas through community-based and at home HIV testing. The sector strives to discover about 8,000-10,000 cases of HIV this year. The HIV/AIDS treatment would be improved and distributed to 140,000 patients, and provide ARV medicine to the grassroots clinics. The sector would continue to mobilise financial resources for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities, and expand treatment through medical insurance. Measures to reduce overcrowded hospitals and increase quality of healthcare services would be a priority. This year’s objective includes food safety inspections at both production and retail levels. Indiscrimination use of antibiotics In the meeting reviewing the national action plan on drug resistant prevention held on Monday in Hà Nội, deputy Minister of Health Prof. Dr. Nguyễn Viết Tiến warned that indiscriminate drug use and the purchase of drugs without prescription would contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance which caused harm to the whole community. “The leading cause of drug resistance came from buying and selling antibiotics so easily and without doctors’ prescriptions”, Tiến told the meeting. ""Việt Nam is in a group of countries with a high rate of antibiotic resistance, even worse than many countries,” the deputy minister said. Using drugs without doctor’s instructions had many risks, including multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria which has been spreading from one country to another threatening human health, said Tiến. In order to overcome the antibiotic resistance, Prof. Dr. Tiến said each person should raise awareness about effective use of drugs, including antibiotics, for themselves and the community as well as follow doctors’ instruction and prescriptions. In addition, it was necessary to raise the responsibilities of those who are entitled to use drugs including doctors and pharmacists to strictly control the prescription and drug sales, the doctor said. Meanwhile, Prof. Dr. Lương Ngọc Khuê, head of the Medical Examination and Treatment Department, pointed out six main reasons for the drug resistance situation in Việt Nam. Those were unreasonably prescribing antibiotics with too low or too high doses or not depending on microbiological test results or prolonged uses; patients using antibiotics without prescription; misuse of antibiotics in aquaculture; inadequate infection control in health facilities and farms; lack of proper plastic waste disposal facilities; and the lack of new invented antibiotics. Work on drug resistance prevention has exposed weaknesses including lack of co-operation, limited awareness of the community, health and agricultural workers to drug resistance is generally limited and modest capacity of the microbiological system, said Khuê. – VNS",Society,"['antibiotics', 'doctors', 'drug', 'control', 'including', 'resistance', 'epidemic', 'strives', 'sector', 'drugs', 'health', 'healthcare']","HÀ NỘI – This year, the healthcare sector aims to reduce death rates caused by diseases and epidemics to increase life expectancy.

Hepatitis C screenings target high-risk populations,People at risk of contracting hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be able to access more convenient testing options and information through a new initiative launched yesterday in HCM City.,[],2018-02-03,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY — People at risk of contracting hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be able to access more convenient testing options and information through a new initiative launched on Thursday in HCM City. The community-based HCV/HIV intervention project increases access to HCV screening, diagnosis and treatment for high-risk populations in the city. Under the project, which will end in October, a total of 5,000 people at risk will receive HCV information, and 2,500 clients will have HCV rapid diagnostic testing, said Trần Thị Hương Liên, project coordinator. The testing, which is available at community-led private clinics, only requires a small amount of blood from the prick of a finger. Ninety per cent of HCV-reactive clients will receive confirmatory testing and counselling on treatment options, Liên said. Although up to 4 per cent of the population in Việt Nam are exposed to HCV, and from 29 to more than 90 per cent of populations with higher risk, such as people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men, are exposed to HCV, only a small proportion with the disease know they are infected, according to Kimberly Green, PATH’s programme director for HIV, tuberculosis, and non-communicable diseases in Việt Nam. Only a vastly reduced proportion of those diagnosed with HCV have access to and complete entire course of treatment, she said. This is despite the fact that HCV is curable and newer direct acting antivirals are available that can treat HCV early in the course of disease and prevent morbidity and early death due to cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer, she added. However, with rapid point-of-care testing, and lower-cost, direct-acting antivirals that are pan-genotypic and can be used for all HCV genotypes, the opportunity to identify, treat and work towards eliminating HCV are stronger than ever before, Green said. Similar to HIV, the HCV virus is spread through the blood or body fluids of an infected person through unprotected sex or shared needles. The project is being implemented by the HCM City Provincial AIDS Centre in coordination with PATH, an international non-profit organisation, Gilead Sciences, and private clinics in the city. —VNS",Society,"['testing', 'project', 'hcm', 'city', 'việt', 'hepatitis', 'highrisk', 'screenings', 'target', 'c', 'risk', 'cent', 'access', 'hcv', 'populations', 'treatment']","HCM CITY — People at risk of contracting hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be able to access more convenient testing options and information through a new initiative launched on Thursday in HCM City.

AIDS Day a reminder of long road ahead,"Following World AIDS Day on December 1, people are reminded that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow, with concern that some countries are seeing a resurgence in infection rates which were previously stable or on the decline.",[],2006-12-08,vietnamnews.vn,"Outlook (08-12-2006) AIDS Day a reminder of long road ahead by Nguyen Thu Hang Following World AIDS Day on December 1, people are reminded that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow, with concern that some countries are seeing a resurgence in infection rates which were previously stable or on the decline. According to the latest figures from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organisation, an estimated 39.5 million people are now living with HIV, with 4.3 million new cases this year. Some 2.9 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2006. The disease’s spread was most noticeable in East and Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. AIDS is set to join heart disease and stroke as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since the first case was reported in 1981, making it one of the most destructive illnesses in history. ""In a short quarter of a century, AIDS has drastically changed our world,"" UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. According to a recent UNAIDS report, young people between 15 and 24 account for 40 per cent of new infections worldwide. ""Even in countries where the epidemic has had a very high impact, such as South Africa, general awareness is still worryingly low,"" said Karen Stanecki, UNAIDS epidemiologist. Decline of HIV infections in most East African countries and the impact of better access to treatment gives rise to hope. Sub-Saharan Africa still bears the highest burden, with 63 per cent of the world’s infected people. Condom availability and other safe sex programmes have helped curb the infection rate with some countries showing early success, such as Uganda. Challenges In many countries, HIV prevention programmes are still not reaching the people most at risk, such as youths, sex workers and their clients, drug users, and ethnic minorities. New data also shows that HIV prevention programmes are failing to address the overlap between drug use and sex workers in Latin America, Eastern Europe and particularly Asia. Levels of safe sex and HIV knowledge remain low in many of these countries, as well as the perception of personal risk. China and India, where ignorance of the virus is rampant, are feared to be on the brink of an explosive HIV growth. According to the UNAIDS report, there are almost 8 million people with HIV/AIDS living in south and southeast Asia. India has the world’s largest number of HIV/AIDS cases in a single country, with 5.7 million cases. When Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) leaders met in Ha Noi on November 18-19, they agreed to enhance co-operation on HIV/AIDS, and expand efforts toward combating the spread of the disease. The leaders also want to ensure the rights of those living with the disease are protected. One of APEC’s long term goals is to ensure the United Nations’ declared goal of universal access to medicine, treatment, care and support by 2010 is achieved. Combating AIDS in Viet Nam Like many other countries in Southeast Asia, Viet Nam has reported a number of new cases this year, with HIV spread across all 64 provinces despite Government efforts. On the eve of World AIDS Day, Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet called on all Vietnamese people to actively participate in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and praised efforts by Government and non-government organisations to curb the disease’s spread over the past year. ""HIV/AIDS prevention activities should be a top priority in the country’s socio-economic development. It requires the participation and close co-operation of ministries, organisations and individuals,"" said Triet. ""There is no cure for HIV or AIDS. But if we build community awareness, we can stop this harmful disease from spreading."" During a two-day visit to Viet Nam on Tuesday, Bill Clinton, former US president and president of the Clinton Foundsation for HIV/AIDS, appreciated the Viet Nam Government’s in preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS and said his foundation would continue to help Vietnamese women and children fight the disease, and was ready to consider further humanitarian assistance to Viet Nam in other areas. Clinton and Health Minister Tran Thi Trung Chien signed an agreement between the Clinton Foundation and Viet Nam’s Health Ministry as the foundation will next year supply medicines to Vietnamese children who suffer from HIV/AIDS. Viet Nam’s improving economic conditions has given the country a fighting chance in battling the epidemic, according to experts Dr Le Truong Giang, vice chairman of the HCM City Committee for HIV/AIDS Control, said local and foreign HIV/AIDS agencies have recorded impressive achievements in combating the disease in the past year. Some 40,000 people are infected with HIV each year in Viet Nam, the majority are drug users and persons who buy or sell sex. ""More education is needed to change public understanding about the epidemic as well as its spread,"" said Giang. ""Education should focus on warning people about protecting themselves from the disease."" By 2010, the Government hopes that 95 per cent of youths will have basic knowledge on reproduction, sex education and safe sex practices.",Opinion,"['spread', 'nam', 'hiv', 'day', 'ahead', 'hivaids', 'road', 'viet', 'million', 'aids', 'long', 'reminder', 'disease', 'countries', 'sex']","Outlook(08-12-2006)AIDS Day a reminder of long road aheadby Nguyen Thu HangFollowing World AIDS Day on December 1, people are reminded that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow, with concern that some countries are seeing a resurgence in infection rates which were previously stable or on the decline.

The HCM City AIDS Committee’s programme to acquire anti-retroviral drugs for patients had benefited more than 3,500 people as of last month. — VNA/VNS Photo The Anh HCM CITY — Feeling wasted, 27 year-old Than Minh Chanh insisted his parents stop spending large amounts of money on anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs every month. In July 2004, Chanh, who had been a drug addict for three years, discovered he was carrying HIV. The doctors at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases told him the medicine would cost at least VND1.5 million (US$100 then) a month and that he had to take it for the rest of his life. But his parents said that no matter how much it cost, they wanted him to be with them for as long as possible, so in August the same year, Chanh started taking the medicine. Yet, after one year, in September of last year, he realised that financial pressure on his parents was too much and he thought about quitting the programme. One noon in September while he was watching television, he saw a news programme about HIV/AIDS and learned that the city had been carrying out a free ARV programme for people with HIV/AIDS for a month. Even though he had doubts about the programme, he and his father decided to visit the Binh Thanh District Counselling and Community Support Centre. ""Right at the door of the building, I felt comfortable with the centre,"" Chanh said. ""Even the person who watched the motorbikes realised I was new to the centre and offered to show me the way to see the counsellors."" There he met many people like him and learned about the virus he was carrying, AIDS, and the side effects of ARV drugs. He joined the Misa club with other drug addicts and at the club’s monthly meeting, he and other people talked about different topics, including nutrition, the problems of stigma attached to the disease, and helping other people. ""For a long time I felt so hopeless and wasted,"" Chanh said. ""Now I feel like I still have so much to give to people like me."" Because of his active support, in July Chanh was officially recruited to be part of the Binh Thanh Counselling and Community Support Centre’s peer educator and home-care group. Every day, Chanh and other people in his group visit high-risk groups, such as drug users and sex workers, to talk to them about the risk of getting HIV, provide them with syringes or condoms, and tell them about the ARV programme. Free ARV Programme Sitting in his small office, Doctor Nguyen Thanh Liem, head of the Binh Thanh Centre, said that he was very happy when the free ARV programme was started. Liem said he used to feel helpless and sad when he visited people with HIV/AIDS and saw that most of them had no money to buy food or even medicine. ""When some international organisations came to do research, I had no hope that we would receive free ARV drugs,"" Liem said. ""So when the programme really started in August last year, I was so happy."" At the meeting to review the first year of the free ARV programme, Le Truong Giang, deputy director of health and chairman of the HCM City AIDS Committee, said that one year of ARV drugs for a HIV/AIDS person costs about US$1,300. Even though the AIDS Committee initially targeted to provide free ARV for 2,000 people in the first year, total foreign funding of $3.6 million from Esther, the Global Fund, the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other organisations have benefited more than 3,500 people as of last month. Giang is proud that within a short period of time, his committee and the health department was able to organise the voluntary testing centres, the treatment procedures, the hospitals, the counselling and community support centres, and the peer educators and home-care groups at the district level. While he attributed the full support of the central and city authorities, the Ministry of Health, and his department, Giang noted the active participation of the local healthcare workers and the peer educators. ""The effectiveness of our network allowed us to call for financial, technical and experience support from international organisations,"" Giang said. As a result, Giang said that Viet Nam has been able to curb the spreading rate of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, Giang also admitted that the distribution of syringes for drug users and condoms for sex workers who are high-risk groups for HIV/AIDS is still limited. He also said that to take care of some 40,000 people with HIV, about 20,000 AIDS patients, and an additional 10,000 new cases anticipated each year, more human resources for HIV/AIDS workers were needed than the present figure of less than 1,200 staff. Giang has proposed that the city People’s Committee allow the AIDS Committee to set up an HIV/AIDS research and training centre to provide training courses for HIV/AIDS workers in the city and other southern provinces. Until now, hospital fees and testing charges for HIV/AIDS-infected people who are admitted to hospitals – typically when they have tuberculosis or encounter serious side effects from ARV drugs – are still relatively high. Giang said with the issuance of the Law on HIV/AIDS this year, which will come into effect next year, he thought that state medical insurance should also start paying for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Mother-to-child story While Giang said that next year his committee planned to triple the number of AIDS people to receive free ARV drugs to 8,000 next year, he also set the bar higher. He wants to reduce the rate of HIV/AIDS transmission from infected mother to child to less than 4 per cent among those who take ARV drugs. Giang said that worldwide the average rate of transmission without ARV intervention is 30 per cent, which means of the 700 pregnant women in HCM City last year, about 210 of their newborns would be HIV-infected. But the reported rate from the hospitals is 13 per cent. And for the expecting mothers who take ARV regularly, the rate has been lowered to 4.8 per cent, according to the AIDS Committee’s report. Besides the free ARV, Giang’s committee has managed to call for funding for free formula for a newborn’s first six months. While the programme is run by the HCM City AIDS Committee, Giang said that half of these women, and 15 per cent of other ARV beneficiaries, are from other provinces. Giang said that the fight against HIV/AIDS has been carried out by many other agencies as well, not just his committee or the Department of Health. At the Tam Binh II House in Thu Duc District’s Linh Xuan Ward run by the Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, about 50 health care workers are helping adults in their physical battle, but also doing one of the hardest jobs. These workers, including adult orphans, volunteered to help take care of 96 orphans aged a few months to eight years old who were born to HIV-infected mothers. Those who are only HIV-negative will resume a normal life through adoption or stay at the orphanages. For the house staff, it is always a sad moment when they learn that any baby is HIV-positive. At the centre today, 33 babies aged from 1.5 years old to eight years old are fighting against the deadly virus. Whenever a child shows a lack of appetite or diarrhoea, the staff start worrying. At a meeting with Tea Leoni, an American actress who was on a visit to HCM City last year as a UNICEF Ambassador, some children at the centre told her that they attended school regularly and wanted to become a doctor to be able to cure the disease. At the closing day of the school year, the children also attended a ceremony at nearby Xuan Hiep Primary School where they were given complimentary certificates.",Society,"['arv', 'ease', 'patients', 'projects', 'city', 'giang', 'hivaids', 'workers', 'chanh', 'aims', 'aids', 'pain', 'committee', 'free', 'programme']","Projects aims to ease AIDS patients’ pain(01-12-2006)by Hong VanTwo doctors at HCM City District 1’s Health Service Centre carry out a check-up on an AIDS patient.

Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective. — Photo baohaiquan.vn HCM CITY (VNS) — Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective, local health officials have said. At a workshop on occupational diseases held on Thursday in HCM City, Dr Huynh Tan Tien, head of the citys Labour Health and Environment Protection Centre, said that obeying standard precautions was the best way to prevent the infection. Recently, the Ha Noi Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital admitted a patient they did not know to be HIV positive. During emergency surgery, the hospitals 18 doctors and nurses did not wear protective clothing. After four hours of surgery, the doctors and nurses took anti-HIV medications following a World Health Organisation recommendation. Research also shows that between 2011 and 2014, HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases had 428 health officials exposed to HIV, accounting for 56.3 per cent of the total number of fields with staff exposed to HIV, such as police and rehabilitation centres. No one has tested HIV positive. Sharp devices that caused wounds on the skin caused the highest rate (53.9 per cent) of transmission among healthcare staff, police, rehabilitation workers and others who have exposure to HIV, according to the research study. Nurses who injected or took blood from patients with HIV were also at a high risk of exposure. Recommended precautions are frequent hand washing; wearing gloves, face masks and other clothing; proper transport of patients; and treatment of medical waste, Tien said. The precautionary standards should be applied to all patients and health officials, he said. Infections can spread from patients to patients, patients to health officials, or health officials to patients. Under the Ministry of Healths regulation, each hospital is required to have a faculty or team in charge of infection prevention and control. Ha Kim Phuong, specialist of the Medical Examination and Treatment Department, said that after five years of implementation of the circular on guidance for hospital infection prevention and control in health facilities, 13.3 per cent of hospitals nationwide had not set up a faculty in charge of the issue. More than 41 per cent of the countrys total hospitals have no sterilizing units, and 93.2 per cent have not conducted surveys on hospital acquired infections since 2010. Treatment Dr Nguyen Viet Thinh of the city Pasteur Institute said that healthcare staff were also at risk of being infected by hepatitis. Thinh recommended that healthcare staff receive vaccines against hepatitis. Tien said that influenza and tuberculosis were also occupational diseases. Health staff who have contact with hazardous elements in surgery and tests, including contact with people with HIV/AIDS and patients with hepatitis, should undergo testing for occupational diseases within six months after contact, Tien said. Those staff who have contact with infectious diseases and tuberculosis, and work during disease outbreaks, should have examinations within 12 months. A council for medical assessment specifies the level of health decline and labour capacity if the staff test positive for any of the occupational diseases. After the assessment, the staff is treated and examined periodically. When resuming work, the staff are assigned to work in environments that are not considered hazardous or dangerous, Tien said. — VNS",Society,"['clinics', 'infection', 'diseases', 'patients', 'hiv', 'officials', 'hospital', 'staff', 'cent', 'protect', 'risk', 'health', 'tien']","Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective. — Photo baohaiquan.vnHCM CITY (VNS) — Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective, local health officials have said.

ARV therapy is now offered at 33 city-level hospitals and district preventive health centres. HCM City and four provinces of Dien Bien, Son La, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa are carrying out a pilot programme, based on targets set by the Joint UN programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) that aims to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. The UN ""90-90-90"" targets call for having 90 per cent of all people with HIV to know their status by 2020. It also aims to have 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV infection to receive sustained ARV therapy, and to have 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy to have viral suppression. The central HIV/AIDS Prevention Department and the citys AIDS Prevention Committee yesterday discussed a detailed plan to achieve the targets. This is especially important as funds from international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention have fallen since Viet Nam is no longer ranked a low-income country by the UN. The committee estimates that according to the targets, the city will have 14,038 more people with HIV to need treatment by 2020. ""This is a big challenge for the city because hospitals and district preventive health centres are overloaded,"" Dr Tieu Thi Thu Van, the committees head, said. The city hospitals and district preventive health centres are treating 27,500 people with HIV. Expanding the therapy to district general hospitals and private health clinics is very important, she said. Van has asked the Ministry of Health to develop specific policies for the city to pay for therapy from a health insurance fund when international funding for ARV drugs ends in 2016. The city plans to manage HIV patients receiving ARV therapy through electronic medical records or phone messages. This will help keep track of the patients and ensure that 90 per cent of them have viral suppression by 2020. The city will also expand the testing network for finding new HIV patients so that 90 per cent of people with HIV will know their status by 2020. Van said that the committee would carry out rapid HIV antibody tests at district health centres. At least 41,841 people with HIV live in HCM City, she said. Dr Phan Thi Thu Huong, the departments deputy head, said the city was seeing a trend of HIV transmission through sex. The risk of HIV transmission through sex among people using amphetamines is now very high, as they tend to engage in unprotected sex under influence of the drug. Huong said that encouraging the use of condoms among this group was difficult. ""It is very important to find these patients and provide treatment,"" she added. Nguyen Hoang Long, the departments head, said that the citys number of patients with HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the countrys total number of HIV patients. HCM City prevention activities greatly influence similar prevention programmes throughout the country, he added. — VNS",Society,"['arv', 'patients', 'city', 'fight', 'hospitals', 'hiv', 'expand', '90', 'cent', 'aids', 'district', 'health', 'therapy']","HCM City plans to expand anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy to general district hospitals in an aim to achieve the target of providing treatment to 90 per cent of the city's patients diagnosed with HIV by 2020. — VNA/VNS PhotoHCM CITY (VNS) — HCM City plans to expand anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy to general district hospitals in an aim to achieve the target of providing treatment to 90 per cent of the city's patients diagnosed with HIV by 2020.

Chan’s visit attempted to curb discrimination against HIV/AIDS victims. He travelled to the northern province of Quang Ninh, which has the highest rate of HIV in the country, to meet with HIV/AIDS patients and to tour the regions’ treatment facilities. In Ha Noi, Chan met Buddhist monks and nuns at Phap Van Pagoda who provide care and support for HIV-positive children and adults. They also work with young adolescents at a ""healthy living club"" to share personal experiences in combating HIV/AIDS. Le Huong asked Chan about his goals for his short visit. Do you think a three-day visit is long enough to fulfil your mission? No. Discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients has been going on for 15-20 years. It’s not a one-day job, it’s a long term one. We have so many things to do and everyone should get involved. The press plays the most important role in spreading the news. I need the media’s help. You have made a series of films for UN programmes during the trip. Do you think you might return to Viet Nam to work with Vietnamese directors in artistic films? I cannot say if I will return. Yet I promise I will think of something to do for Viet Nam. Last year, I went to Cambodia to witness the landmine situation in the country, and I decided to return to make a film on landmines. Last week I was in Aceh (Indonesia), and I realised that I should organise an international charity concert (to raise money for the locality). I don’t have any ideas about Viet Nam yet, but I will think it over. If anybody has a good script, pass it on to me. I’m famous but I’m very cheap. What is your first impression of Viet Nam? I have travelled quite a lot in the past few days. In Viet Nam, I keep travelling by car, but I just fall asleep because the trips are so tiring. I stole two books on Viet Nam from the hotel to learn about the culture. I love beautiful Vietnamese women, their traditional dress, the food and motorbikes, too. What is the difference between a comedic action star and a Goodwill Ambassador? Well, being a Goodwill Ambassador is more difficult. In films, if I do something wrong, I can do it again. Sometimes I write my own script, and if it is not good enough, I just edit the script and try the scene again. As a Goodwill Ambassador, I cannot make mistakes. Everything is new to me. Before assuming this role, I didn’t fully understand the effects of war, HIV or landmines. Every conversation makes me cry. I just think about how I can help people. It’s a lot of pressure, but it’s good pressure. Do you like doing charity work? Charity work makes me happy. Before, I just knew how to become famous and earn money. But my friends told me I should do something for other people. Then I started charity work, such as adopting children, building schools, and establishing the Jackie Chan Foundation (to provide annual scholarships to students in the performing and technical arts, to support youth projects, and to assist performing artists who have suffered hardships and injuries). I think anyone, rich or poor, can contribute something to charity. How did you teach your son these lessons? I didn’t teach him anything. At first, he just wanted to spend money. I don’t give him my money, but I let him earn his own. He is like me when I was 19, I just wanted to enjoy my life. But my son recently went to Thailand for three days to help tsunami victims. He returned as a totally different person.",Life & Style,"['think', 'goodwill', 'chan', 'script', 'return', 'nam', '28042005', 'vulture', 'viet', 'money', 'visit', 'culture', 'work']","Culture Vulture(28-04-2005)Jackie Chan, world famous actor and martial arts expert, paid an official visit to Viet Nam few days ago (April 23-25) as a UNICEF and UNAIDS Goodwill Ambassador.

UN calls on Viet Nam to continue combating HIV,"UNAIDS Viet Nam called on Viet Nam to invest wisely in its HIV response to ensure it achieves national and global targets on the occasion of the 25th World AIDS Day, which took place on Sunday.",[],2013-12-02,vietnamnews.vn,"UNAIDS Viet Nam called on Viet Nam to invest wisely in its HIV response to ensure it achieves national and global targets on the occasion of the 25th World AIDS Day, which took place on Sunday.— File Photo HA NOI (VNS) — UNAIDS Viet Nam called on Viet Nam to invest wisely in its HIV response to ensure it achieves national and global targets on the occasion of the 25th World AIDS Day, which took place on Sunday. ""Viet Nam has made great progress against HIV. But big challenges remain. It is critical for Viet Nam to focus precious national resources on three things: the right people, the right places and scaling up the most effective interventions,"" said Dr. Kristan Schoultz, Country Director of UNAIDS Viet Nam. ""The right people are key populations at higher risk of infection: people who inject drugs and their sexual partners, people who buy and sell sex and men who have sex with men. We need to reach out to these populations in high-burdened areas of the country with interventions that make the biggest difference: condoms, sterile injecting equipment, HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment,"" said Schoultz. Viet Nam has made significant strides in scaling up HIV treatment and reducing the rate of new HIV infections; as a result, the epidemic appears to be stabilising. However, high levels of HIV persist among key populations. In some cities, more than half of men who inject drugs were living with HIV by the end of 2012. The national rate for men having HIV among those who inject drugs was estimated at 11 per cent. National HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 2.7 per cent. Current evidence also indicates that HIV prevalence is increasing among men who have sex with men, a population that will account for an increasing proportion of future HIV infections. The epidemic was still prevalent in mountainous and remote areas, said Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and people living with HIV/AIDS continued to face significant discrimination—making it harder for them to access health services. Decreasing support, both technical and financial, also presented an obstacle, Phuc added. As donor funding for HIV response declines, the United Nations was encouraging the country to expand initiatives that focus on earlier diagnosis and getting people on treatment as soon as possible in order to maximise the returns and impact of national investment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also called on Viet Nam to make greater efforts to improve access to prevention, treatment, care and support services for key populations. This could be achieved through strengthening the partnership between the Ministry of Health and communities, promoting more proactive, simplified HIV testing and counseling strategies and maximising the treatment and prevention benefits of antiretroviral treatment. ""HIV response in Viet Nam is at a pivotal juncture. The scaling-up of innovative approaches is required to maintain momentum and build upon past achievements,"" said WHO Representative in Viet Nam Dr. Takeshi Kasai. ""We now know that HIV treatment can prevent transmission of HIV. By further supporting early access to HIV diagnosis and treatment, Viet Nam will be able to reduce new HIV infections and deaths caused by AIDS,"" added Kasai. Deputy Prime Minister Phuc said the Prime Minister had approved a project to ensure funding for HIV/AIDS control and prevention activities for the 2013-2020 period. A meeting with the theme ""Towards no more new HIV infected people"" was organised by the Viet Nam Red Cross Society in collaboration with the Viet Nam Youth Network on HIV/AIDS Prevention on Saturday in Ha Noi.

The 12-year-old Ban said he had had a high fever and cough for weeks. The boy was too tired to sell lottery tickets on the street, his only source of income. Like many other street kids, Ban hesitated to come to the clinic, even though he had heard about it from his peers. ""I was afraid of being thrown out, so I didn’t dare to come in. And I didn’t have any money. If they asked me to pay for health care, I wouldn’t have known what to do,"" Ban said. Ban has been living on the street since he was four years old and has done a number of odd jobs to survive: selling lottery tickets, shining shoes and even begging. He does not know who his parents are or where he was born. His family is the other street kids, who gather during meals and late at night in a constantly changing location from Go Vap to Tan Binh districts. He got his name, Ban, which means hives in Vietnamese, because of his year-round heat rash. But luckily things turned out differently than he expected. He was welcomed and given a medical examination and tablets free of charge. ""He needs a few days rest and will be fine,"" said doctor Nguyen Dang Phan. Pilot project Xom Moi, like the five other private clinics offering free checks-up, treatment and medicine for street kids, is part of the Centre of Health Education and Comm-unication’s pilot project to create friendly healthcare services for the city’s homeless children. After six months of operations, Mai Khoi private clinic on Tu Xuong Street, Xom Moi on Pham Van Chieu Street, Camillo on Le Van Si Street and Trieu Phuoc and Van Phuoc in District 11 have become familiar addresses with the city’s street kids. Truong Trong Hoang, a representative of the municipal Department of Health’s Centre for Health Education and Communication, said that homeless kids faced many health problems, especially reproductive problems and the risk of HIV/AIDS. ""The clinics not only take care of their health but also educate them about life skills to protect themselves from social evils and fatal diseases,"" Hoang said. There are an estimated 1,300 street kids in the city. ""These clinics maintain their operations by dividing the clinics into two parts: one for those who pay fees for medical examinations and the other for street children,"" said the centre’s representative Hoang Thi Thu Loan. Modern equipment According to Loan, all the private clinics are equipped with modern medical equipment. The owner of the Van Phuoc and Trieu Phuoc private clinics, Ho Thi Trang, said that the eight doctors and eight nurses in her clinics received more than 20 children per month. Many are girls between 14 and 17 coming for an abortion. ""They know nothing about reproductive healthcare, and ask for abortions for pregnancies over two months old,"" Trang said. ""Most are panicked and worried because they can hardly feed themselves, not to mention a baby."" Doctor Phan said that his clinic reserved one room for kids infected with HIV/AIDS. ""They will be moved there and taken care of for the rest of their life when the disease becomes serious,"" Phan said. Trang said that children mostly heard about her clinic through word of mouth. ""We are willing to receive more kids and we want to do something useful for them.
