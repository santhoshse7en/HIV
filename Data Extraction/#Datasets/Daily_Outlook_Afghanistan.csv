The nurse is involved at every stage of the trajectory of a person living with HIV—from usually being the first to counsel the newly diagnosed person, to one of the last to be with him/her at the point of death. This significant, albeit less recognized, role played by nurses across the world in the care, support, and treatment of people living with HIV (PLHIV) was the key theme of an important event hosted by the US based Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (ANAC) at the recently concluded 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Nurses are the backbone of effective HIV response Nurses have always been the front and centre of public health crises. In the most recent outbreak of Ebola during May 2018 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the first health professional to die of the infection was a nurse. At the beginning of the HIV epidemic, nurses provided the bulk of in-hospital care during the difficult pre-ART phases, and though there are no recorded incidents of nurses catching HIV in the workplace, there is an associated toll. Nurses can often be stigmatized because of their place of work, and/or work alone in rural clinics with little support and the expectation that they provide all the required care. Nurses also provide point of care HIV tests, support people following a TB test, counsel pregnant young women following a positive HIV diagnosis, and give immediate information about treatment and lifestyle. Indeed, according to Carole Treston, Executive Director of ANAC, nurses are in a prime position to be champions of human rights, “stigma busters and discrimination fighters.” Why are nurses absent from HIV policy making? Yet nurses are usually absent from policy-making, and even the International AIDS Society has never had a nurse on its board. Nurses do seek influence, not through hubris but rather a desire to shape policy impacting directly on the lives of people affected by HIV. This is something they have in common with civil society organisations, a cohort that since the beginning of the HIV epidemic has become, and rightly so, increasingly vocal and influential. But where are the nurses? Often, they are simply too busy working at the ground. Then again, in some areas of Africa and South America, for example, nurses are routinely rotated around specialties, working as HIV nurses for only a limited period of time and with little opportunity for career progression in the field. There is also the question of gender, with female nurses less likely to progress in countries where gender inequality is endemic and with hierarchical health systems dominated by male doctors. This is perhaps the reason ANAC and other HIV nursing associations find it difficult to reach out and connect with nurses in eastern Europe and central Asia, where nurses are relatively disempowered compared to the west. Nurses here are unlikely to reach the levels of autonomy required for policy-making involvement and networking. Heed nurses’ voices for effective HIV responses The aforesaid event considered a range of options for nurses to be more influential in the HIV response. Shaun Watson, currently chair of the UK’s national HIV nursing association, shared details with CNS (Citizen News Service www.citizen-news.org) of the U=U campaign to which an increasing numbers of nursing groups are signing up to, such as NHIVNA (UK), the European HIV Nursing Network, and the Dutch HIV Nursing Association. For Shaun Watson, “As the people who diagnose HIV, start treatment, monitor adherence, listen to and manage concerns over symptoms and side effects, it will be nurses at the forefront of the U=U campaign. The evidence is clear that the risk of sexually passing on HIV when virally suppressed and engaged in care is zero. This is an important message to get across not only to HIV nurses but to every other nurse.” Given the dominance of nurses in HIV care, speaking the truth to those in power must be within their remit. Nurses should not be afraid to raise their voices and be heard against the background of an ever-increasing dominance of medicalisation and reliance on data gathering in the HIV response. For Susan Strasser, Senior Implementation Director of ICAP’s global portfolio of public health programmes at Columbia University, the epidemic control of HIV will “only be achieved on the backs and in the hands of nurses.”",{},"['nurses', 'nursing', 'epidemic', 'support', 'response', 'aids', 'care', 'treatment', 'health', 'hiv']","Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, nurses have been at the forefront of the response to this once fatal infection.

Dramatic Increase in HIV/Aids,Opinion: Afghanistan is in the early stage of dramatic increase of HIV/AIDs while the main route of  transmission are reported needle sharing; Officials in the ministry of public health of Afghanistan...,,"December 06, 2016","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Afghanistan is in the early stage of dramatic increase of HIV/AIDs while the main route of transmission are reported needle sharing; Officials in the ministry of public health of Afghanistan informed of impressive increase in HIV/AIDS positive cases in the country. Deputy public health minister Najia Tariq said on Sunday that the HIV/AIDS cases have increased by 38 percent as compared to last year. She said at least 162 HIV/AIDS positive cases have been recorded across the country during the current year, but around 117 HIV positive cases were recorded last year. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates around 5,000 people are affected with HIV/AIDS virus across the country, and only 30 percent of HIV positive cases have been recorded so far whereas, historically, the first HIV positive case was recorded in earlier in 1989. In addition to damage of immune system, the HIV victims are additionally damaged by mental trauma in traditional societies such as Afghanistan. They may face with humiliating behavior or easily isolated by their family and friends, or by their community. On the other hand, they face with poor treatment in healthcare and educational settings. It all starts with a sense of disbelief when tested positive and then the patient loses all hope, leading to panic and fear. Many people living with HIV are at an increased risk of developing mood swings, cognitive or anxiety disorders. These can severely affect the nervous system. In global level, the HIV/AIDS is not over but it can be if we tailor the response to individual needs at particular times in life. According to reports, there are about 78 million people who have become infected with HIV and 35 million have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the first cases. The number of new HIV infections has not declined specially among adults and young women. The latest data by the WHO shows that there are 37 million people living with the disease and only 18.2 million people are receiving antiretroviral treatment worldwide. Hence, there is serious need to raising awareness in order to prevent the spread and pave the way for access to antiretroviral medicines. A life-cycle approach to HIV that finds solutions for everyone at every stage of life can address the complexities of HIV. Risks and challenges change as people go through life, highlighting the need to adapt HIV prevention and treatment strategies from birth to old age. Specially, those with positive results should immediately seek help and confirm reports from health clinics. They also require receiving information and links to counseling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services. Luckily, The World Health Organization (WHO) issued new guidelines on HIV self-testing to help with the diagnosis of the deadly disease. The initiative by the UN health organization aims to help millions know about their HIV status and get the right treatment. With the easy and pertinent self-testing kit, people around the world can know about their status within “20 minutes”. The WHO report says, “HIV self-testing means people can use oral fluid or blood- finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting.” the self-testing should open the door for many more people to know about their HIV status and eventually lead the patients to find out how to get treatment and access prevention services. In addition, some scientists are informing about vaccines and new methods of cure. A large-scale trial of a potential vaccine is underway in South Africa. The study will involve more than 5,400 sexually active men and women ages 18 to 35 in a number of areas around South Africa, a country where more than 1,000 people a day are infected with HIV. The trial will last for four years. According to the latest WHO progress report, “lack of an HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to implementing the expert advices that everyone with HIV should be offered antiretroviral therapy (ART).” As Millions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others. The report shows that 40 per cent of all people affected with the HIV-virus (over 14 million) remain unaware of their status. “Many of these are people at higher risk of HIV infection who often find it difficult to access existing testing services. Self-testing is a best way to reach more people with undiagnosed HIV and represents a step forward to empower individuals, diagnose people earlier before they become sick, bring services closer to where people live, and create demand for HIV testing. This is particularly important for those people facing barriers to accessing existing services. Even so 23 countries have national policies that support HIV self-testing. Many others are developing policies, but wide-scale implementation of HIV self-testing remains limited. The alarming report also suggested that 70 per cent people whose partners are affected by the virus, they also test positive to the test but many of those do not get tested to ascertain their status. Finally, there are several factors and route in Afghanistan contributing to the risk of a HIV epidemic, including economic, social, demographic, unwariness, syringe sharing, unscreened emigrants or visitors and behavioural determinants that, if not addressed effectively, may fuel the spread of HIV. In fact, there is need to national strategy for prevention and fight against issue focusing on certain effected groups such as IDUs, prisoners, foreign sex workers, emigrants and visitors.",{},"['million', 'dramatic', 'status', 'increase', 'report', 'positive', 'treatment', 'health', 'cases', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'selftesting']","Afghanistan is in the early stage of dramatic increase of HIV/AIDs while the main route of transmission are reported needle sharing; Officials in the ministry of public health of Afghanistan informed of impressive increase in HIV/AIDS positive cases in the country.

HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Afghanistan,"Opinion: The Ministry of Health has reported that there are 1,327 cases of HIV AIDS registered in Afghanistan.

Mostly an epidemic among drug users, 70 percent of them are males, 25 percent females, and five percent are children. Majority of cases have been reported in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat provinces. Worldwide, there are 34 million people suffering from HIV and 36 million patients have lost their lives. Around 95% of people with HIV/AIDS live in developing nations. Around half of the infected HIV people are killed by AIDS before they are 35. Every year 1st December is marked as World AIDS Day since 1988. HIV infected people around the world are growing day by day despite the intense campaign to prevent it. Majority of infected people even do not know about the dangers they are faced with. Discrimination and stigma against HIV persons still prevails in countries with most HIV infected people. Afghanistan is increasingly facing an HIV epidemic. Three decades of wars, mass exodus of refugees to Pakistan and Iran and now their return, illiteracy and lack of awareness, stigma and discrimination are the prime factors. The actual number of HIV infected people is far more than the official statistics of Health Ministry. According to official records, the first HIV deaths were registered in May 2008 when a father and his two children passed away due to HIV. And 66 per cent HIV cases were due to used syringes. Official record from just one province, Kandahar, shows the number of infected has doubled. In 2011 there were 11 cases registered, which has increased to 22 this year. Among them, 18 were males and three females who contracted the virus from their husbands. A Health Ministry official from the province says four people had reached a critical stage while three have died. All of the infection has been caused by use of syringes by drug addicts. The prevailing reasons behind the increasing HIV epidemic in Afghanistan is injected drug use, shared syringe and contaminated blood transfers. World Health Organization has already warned high levels of intravenous drug use and unsafe blood transfusions could cause rapid spread of HIV in Afghanistan. After three decades of conflict and war, a large number of Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan have repatriated. Reports suggest that a significant number of infections have been spread by those returning with HIV virus. For instance, recently 88 Afghan refugees in Peshawar city of Pakistan alone had tested positive for HIV including 10 women. The infected people are aged between 25 and 45 years. There is not an effective program particularly designed for Afghans returning from Iran or Pakistan. The UN and Government needs to make a strategy in this regard. Lack of awareness, stigma and discrimination against the AIDS infected people are also major factors behind the increasing epidemic. All these make Afghanistan fertile for HIV epidemic. Drug users and sex workers are the most vulnerable groups of HIV affected people in Afghanistan. Being the largest poppy producing country in the world, there is large number of people taking drug. Lack of awareness and knowledge about HIV prevention is a big threat in this regard as most of these people—sex workers and drug addicts—do not know about the risks and causes of HIV. According to MoPH, there are about 19000 drug addicts that use injection. Illiteracy also creates much problem in this regard. Besides the spread of HIV, lack of awareness also causes discrimination and stigma against infected people. Majority of infections are reported in urban areas, mostly capital Kabul, Herat—bordering Iran—Mazar and Kandahar cities. Though there have been many programs to increase awareness among the adult populations in these cities with primary knowhow about HIV AIDS, however, there is a general belief that the virus only spreads through sexual intercourse. Very few common people are aware that usage of injection syringe by more than a person and some other reasons can also cause spread of the virus. Due to cultural and traditional barriers, people are often reluctant to even talk about such issues. This social behavior is a big hurdle towards generating awareness about HIV AIDs. NGOs working on the issue face such problems from community where they do not allow awareness campaigns to talk about safe sex or related issues. They would never like to send their adult daughters to such awareness programs. Other than that, a general religious misunderstanding and myth is common about HIV. Therefore, the most effective way to spread the word about HIV is to convince religious leaders (Mullahs) and community elders telling them about such serious issues. Under the National AIDS Control Program Afghanistan National HIV/AIDS strategic Framework there are certain objectives for the Public Health Ministry. It aims at gaining political commitment and mobilizing resources necessary to implement the national HIV/AIDS/STI strategy. Public awareness is the most effective way to generate awareness and prevent HIV epidemic. People from all walks of life are needed to play their due responsibility in this regard by spreading the word about the deadly HIV/AIDS.",{},"['epidemic', 'infected', 'aids', 'awareness', 'drug', 'health', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'afghanistan', 'spread', 'number']","Afghanistan is increasingly facing an HIV epidemic.

According to BBC reports, Mohammad Ali, who is one of the HIV infected, talked about the unkindness of government and people. He railed against the cynical views of people towards the HIV infected individuals with strong emotion. He said that there is a common misperception that HIV/AIDS results solely from illegitimate sexual relationships which led to the cynical views of people. He asked that what would be the fault of the innocent babies who are given birth by HIV infected mothers or those who were donated infected blood? He asked for not being left alone. Meanwhile, the officials of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) announced on Sunday that cases of the HIV virus in Afghanistan were up by 38 percent from last year. Based on official reports, more than 300,000 Afghans have been tested for AIDS this year. The first confirmed case of HIV/AIDS appeared in Afghanistan in 1989. Instances of the disease remained negligible for the next fifteen years before a combination of circumstances – including a raise in poppy cultivation, drug trafficking and drug use; unscreened blood being used in transfusions and conflict scattering refugees around the world – began to push infection rates up. According to the UN, around 5,000 people are thought to live with HIV in Afghanistan, but only 30 percent of them have been tested. Amongst the current challenges facing the world, perhaps the biggest of them are AIDS/HIV infections. According to official data, more than 25 million people have died of these infections between 1981 and 2007. Despite improved preventive measures such as condoms and improved antiretroviral treatments, the problem still remains a worry around the world. Of course, in Afghanistan the HIV infected individuals live in seclusion. There are two reasons behind this bitter fact. First, in a religious society like Afghanistan, due to a common misperception that HIV results from illegitimate sexual relationships, people behave them as irreligious and sinful group. Secondly, they avoid them for the fear of being infected through having physical contact such as shaking hands or kissing which are the common styles of greeting amongst Afghan people. In short, there is lack of awareness amongst people. The drug addicts and users are highly vulnerable to HIV disease which forms large numbers in our country. Seemingly, there is a close connection between HIV and using narcotic drugs. As a result, based on official reports, this year there is 36 percent rise in cultivating opium meanwhile there is 38 percent rise in HIV disease comparing to the last year. Hence, curing drug addiction is critical to controlling the spread of the disease. In addition to curbing drug use, one of the biggest challenges ahead remains increasing public awareness about HIV/AIDS. As a traditional country, the general community has a difficult time accepting people with a disease that is widely known to be sexually transmitted. There are numerous stories of women who having been infected by their husband were later accused of prostitution when their families found out. People know only a little about HIV virus. Awareness should be spread by media and also by religious scholars regarding the HIV virus. It is assured that if the religious scholars give proper awareness and make people understand that it is not only resulted by illegal sexual relationships, the people’s attitudes will change about the HIV infected patients. Of course, they should not be marginalized from social life and services. In Islam, visiting patients is emphasized greatly. People should share their concern with them. Mostly those who are sick, feel lonely and disappointed. They long to visit friends to share their pains and feelings and they need a shoulder to cry on. But if they be treated unfairly, they will be more disappointed and lose their hope in their lives. Hence, it is hoped that people will change their wrong attitudes towards them and sympathize them through visiting and showing kindness to them. In addition to providing service for the infected people, government should take action against poppy cultivation and trafficking so as to decrease the HIV spread. As the connection between poppy and HIV was mentioned. Moreover, the drug addicts inject themselves with infected needles which cause the spread of HIV virus. It is amazing for me that despite pouring millions of dollars in the country and existence of many official organs and NGOs, still the poppy cultivation rises and same is the case with HIV infection. Moreover, government seems unconcerned regarding such challenges. However I pressurize my mind to know the causes and effects, I find no answer other than corrupt government. If one is asked about the susceptibility of the country to all types of challenges and harms, s/he will easily attribute the reason to three decades of war. I do not deny that we experienced war and bloodshed within three decades, thousands of our people lost their lives and we were the heir to debris and destructions. Now, my question is that should we concentrate on the negative points of those days and attribute all our faults to the past three decades of war and violence? It would be highly immoral of one to mollify his or her conscience through such words and justify himself/herself, for a fault, this way. Unfortunately, now this answer is very habitual for our officials. It is hoped that the government will use the economic sources and services not only effectively but also efficiently. Moreover, it should adopt a pragmatic mechanism for tackling the challenges and difficulties of the country. In other words, the challenges such as opium cultivation, HIV infection, etc. do not rise rather they will be lowered or rooted out through those dollars and energies. As an Afghan citizen, I am really tortured mentally by such negative news. For instance, 38% rise in HIV infection, 36% raise in opium cultivation, the graph of terrorism victims remains high; the rate of violence against women is terrible, etc. With such news, how is it possible to remain hopeful?",{},"['infected', 'cultivation', 'rise', 'drug', 'tragedy', 'challenges', 'hiv', 'country', 'poppy', 'afghanistan', 'spread']","According to BBC reports, Mohammad Ali, who is one of the HIV infected, talked about the unkindness of government and people.

"5,900 People Infected with HIV/AIDS in Afghanistan","News: Statistics by Ministry of Public  Health show that 28 people died due to HIV/AIDS last year.<br>
  Officials from the Ministry of  Public Health...",,"March 11, 2019","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Statistics by Ministry of Public Health show that 28 people died due to HIV/AIDS last year. Officials from the Ministry of Public Health said their statistics show that 5,900 people have been diagnosed positive with HIV/AIDS virus around the country. The statistics were made public in a meeting organized on the activities of the ministry, especially in prevention of HIV/AIDS. The meeting was attended by the ministry’s officials and representatives of international organizations. Mamozai Zewar, the Deputy Minister of Public Health, said that 28 people lost their lives due to HIV/AIDS infection. Herat, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Balkh and Kunduz provinces have the highest number of HIV/AIDS patients. “The number of people infected with AIDS virus has reached to 5,900 people,” said Zewar. He said they remain committed to fighting the virus and helping those infected with HIV/AIDS. An official from the World Health Organization (WHO) said more works needed in fighting and preventing HIV disease. “In Afghanistan it is moving on the right direction, however, more collective and consulted efforts have to be done and it has to be done,” Merlyn, a representative from WHO said. According to MoPH, currently, 4.4 percent of the addicts injects drugs into their bodies which transfer AIDS virus from one person to another one. The officials said in the last 10 years they have prevented the increase of injections among the addicts to prevent an increase of HIV disease. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is one of the world’s most serious public health challenges. But there a global commitment to stopping new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment. According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS information on website of the organization, there were approximately 36.9 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS in 2017. Of these, 1.8 million were children (<15 years old). An estimated 1.8 million individuals worldwide became newly infected with HIV in 2017 – about 5,000 new infections per day. This includes 180,000 children (<15 years). Most of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and were infected by their HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. Approximately 75% of people living with HIV globally were aware of their HIV status in 2017. The remaining 25% (over 9 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. HIV testing is an essential gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services. AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by more than 51% since the peak in 2004. In 2017, 940 000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 1.4 million in 2010 and 1.9 million in 2004.

Perhaps very few of us know that “Amsterdam, which is currently hosting the 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) from 23-27th July 2018 - the largest conference for any global health issue in the world - became the first city in the world to overshoot the 90:90:90 target, set by UNAIDS (joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS), with a continuum progress of 94:90:94,” said Alphonsus Stoelinga, Netherlands Ambassador to India, in an exclusive interview given to CNS (Citizen News Service) on the eve of AIDS 2018. Stoelinga shared with pride (and rightly so) that Netherlands has indeed been on the forefront of the global fight against HIV/AIDS for quite some time now. “We are actively contributing to UNAIDS’ 90:90:90 target for 2020 that is also intertwined with the global promise of ending AIDS through the adoption of SDGs by 2030. As per UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS)’ Country Progress Report 2016, the Netherlands’ estimated continuum progress in as far back as December 2014 was 88:94:92, with 88% HIV-infected people diagnosed and linked to care; 94% with initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 92% of all people receiving ART with suppressed viral load”, said the Ambassador. Multi-sectoral approaches and innovations are a must Any efforts directed towards ending AIDS cannot function without multi-level cooperation and innovation. Presently, in the absence of functional vaccines or cures against HIV infection, the need for countries to join hands and innovate - both at the local and global levels - becomes more important than ever. “I am very proud to share that the Kingdom of the Netherlands has consistently and diligently been working at both these levels. The Dutch HIV/AIDS policy focuses on 3 core principles: (i) Prevention (ii) Linkage between prevention and care and (iii) Ensuring low threshold access to testing and treatment”, informed Stoelinga. Dealing with HIV the Dutch way Netherlands Ambassador to India Stoelinga claimed that the Dutch were the first nation in the world to spearhead large scale needle exchange programmes to combat the spread of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs). “The first information campaign targeting the Dutch population began in 1987 and it was initiated by the government. HIV testing through public health institutions is free-of-charge. Outreach programs are perpetually being set up for specific risk populations being tested. Free HIV testing, on World AIDS Day (December 1) and during the AIDS Conference 2018, are also being offered. All pregnant women in the Netherlands are tested free of cost for HIV. For most other people, HIV testing is covered by health insurance. Those who are more likely to have STIs and/or HIV (the high risk populations) for various reasons can get tested for free at an STI Outpatients’ Clinic of the Public Health Service”, he said. The again, in Netherlands, HIV testing is also available through the internet and the pharmacy. This allows one to test ones blood or saliva for HIV antibodies at home. The young population is given particular attention - by way of sexual education at schools, mother/child care (in the form of food supplements), prevention of teenage pregnancy, ensuring that young people can be tested for HIV, and those living with HIV have access to the care they need. “Our efforts cover the full spectrum. We have a close-knit system of physicians, nurses, social workers working together to keep all people living with HIV in a continuum of care. Additionally, keeping up with the reach and power of social media, communicating about HIV/AIDS is also a part of our efforts”, the Ambassador said. Global collaboration Netherlands collaborates and shares technical assistance and knowledge with other countries at the global level. At the same time, it also learns from partner countries that have their own set of challenges and solutions. Partnerships are key, working together across sectors and national boundaries is deeply embedded in the country’s traditions. Stoelinga gave one the example of one such initiative - the HIV-Cohort between India, Netherlands and Sweden. Launched during Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s visit to India in May this year, the programme is aimed at tapping into complementary, diverse research strengths and expertise across the three countries to strengthen the development of better tools to understand and address the epidemic of HIV/AIDS, informed Stoelinga. Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are closely related to the goal of ending AIDS. For the Dutch government, the diagnosis, treatment and subsequently, ending AIDS is also closely linked to two of its international policy priorities - SRHR and women empowerment. “We focus on linking SRHR with HIV/AIDS to ensure people have the knowledge and the means to prevent HIV. Linking HIV/AIDS initiatives with SRHR also create an enabling environment in which individuals are free to take decisions to protect themselves.” Stoelinga emphasised that Netherlands government’s priority is to find a functional or real cure for HIV infection. Various research programmes, such as the one at Erasmus Medical College, have been set up to reach this goal. While this is still at a research stage and not clinical practice, he reiterated that the Netherlands will continue to strive for a functional cure against HIV/AIDS. Stoelinga firmly believes that HIV/AIDS issues also form a vital branch for UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good health and well-being) and Goal 5 (Gender equality). “Netherlands has been consistently performing well under the SDG 3. Our country is in full compliance with the international health regulations, and for seven years in a row it has topped the European Health Consumer Index”.",{},"['world', 'aids', 'care', 'global', 'netherlands', 'health', 'ending', 'testing', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'way', 'dutch']","We are all very familiar with the phrase ‘going Dutch’ (meaning each person of a group pays one’s own expenses in an outing), but are we also aware of dealing with HIV/AIDS the Dutch way?

Now, 15 years later, new HIV infections are down significantly worldwide, while access to treatment has cut the number of AIDS-related deaths by more than a third. These achievements are no accident. In 2000, Governments committed to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which addressed the greatest challenges of our time, including halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV. The progress we have seen since then fulfills a promise and proves, that strong leadership and sustained engagement deliver results. Still, much more remains to be done. This year, the international community will need to, once more, show bold action in charting a path forward on HIV. In September, as the deadline for achieving the MDGs comes to an end, governments will decide on a new set of sustainable development goals for the period after 2015. To help define the future of the HIV response in this new era, Governments across Asia-Pacific together with civil society and other partners are gathering in Bangkok this week at a major regional meeting convened by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in partnership with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other organizations. Since HIV first emerged, the Asia-Pacific region has been a leader in demonstrating political commitment and investing resources to address the epidemic. Initiatives like Thailand’s programme to promote safer sex have been widely replicated. However, if the region is to continue to be a pioneer, Governments must urgently confront several challenges head-on. Perhaps the biggest challenge is ensuring sustainable financing for HIV programmes. More than US$ 2 billion has been mobilized for Asia and the Pacific, but international donors account for nearly 40 per cent of the funding. This is not sustainable. While external donors have played a critical role in providing seed money for HIV programmes, countries cannot forever rely on international funding. Clearly there is scope for greater domestic spending given the region’s economic dynamism. China is an example of what is possible. Between 2006 and 2013 the country increased spending on HIV programming seven times. Now, due to its committed leadership, China has made the transition to full self-reliance, even in the face of one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the region. While some low-income countries will continue to need support from international donors, Governments must share responsibility and invest significantly. Otherwise, they risk losing the gains they have worked so hard to secure. They must pay now, or pay forever. While larger domestic investments are needed, it is equally important to get more value for money. As ESCAP member states have recognized in past resolutions, the populations most affected by the HIV epidemic include sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, and people who inject drugs. Yet, despite this knowledge, many countries are underfunding precisely those programmes which would make the most impact. Only an estimated 8 per cent of overall AIDS spending is for HIV prevention among key populations at higher risk of HIV exposure. To get results, health authorities must work with civil society to promote community-based HIV services for the people who need them most. Two-thirds of key populations don’t know their HIV status. It is important to scale up HIV testing by offering simple but highly effective tests in communities. However, ensuring a full return on investments doesn’t only depend on funding. Stigma and discrimination prevent people living with HIV and key population groups from accessing essential services. Almost every country in the region has laws, policies or practices that hinder the AIDS response. For example, 42 countries criminalize some aspect of sex work and 21 countries prohibit same-sex sexual relations. Such laws and policies are unjust, prevent social development and increase risky health behaviour. They must be reversed. 1.5 million people living with HIV in Asia-Pacific are accessing life-saving treatment. While this is a big success, it poses a challenge for the sustainable funding of the AIDS response. To compound the problem, millions more people still need to receive treatment. Governments will, therefore, need to meet the demand for more treatment in the coming years, including new and more expensive antiretroviral treatments (ARTs). The Asia-Pacific region has the potential to meet this challenge. It is a hub of entrepreneurial and scientific innovation, which manufactures affordable HIV treatment and other commodities on a large scale. Indian manufacturers, for example, already provide the bulk of the generic ARTs used in low-and-middle income countries, helping to drive down the cost of HIV treatment across the globe. Going forward, we will need to continue this trend towards reducing the price of ARTs, discovering new and more powerful treatments, and hopefully one day finding a cure. Ending the AIDS epidemic in Asia and the Pacific is possible, as long as countries have the courage and wisdom to take the right kinds of action. Governments must invest significantly more in the AIDS response. They must increase the impact of their investments by refocusing their efforts on the people at higher risk of HIV infection. Finally, they must promote scientific innovation and affordable access to life-saving medicine. Such bold actions will not only accelerate the progress made in Asia and the Pacific in responding to HIV in the new millennium; they will also help propel the world to end the AIDS epidemic, once and for all.",{},"['world', 'region', 'epidemic', 'end', 'aids', 'governments', 'countries', 'sex', 'lead', 'treatment', 'asiapacific', 'need', 'hiv', 'sustainable']","This century opened with the AIDS epidemic at its peak.

Dr. Mohammad Liaqat Adil, speaking at a conference “Let’s rescue our work force from AIDS” in Jalalabad, said unemployment had increased in the country, giving rise poverty and HIV/AIDS cases. He assailed the government, particularly the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), for launching effective public awareness programmes despite spending a lot of money on eradicating HIV/AIDS. A large number of returning Afghan refugees also contributed to increasing unemployment, an issue that needed serious attention from the government, the senior trade unionist said. But a doctor at the Nangarhar Public Health Department, Noor Hassan Basharyar, said the government had made remarkable efforts for eliminating HIV and AIDS and public awareness on the issue had increased. He added besides the public awareness programmes, the MoPH had also launched other initiatives for the prevention of the deadly disease in society, detention centers, drug addicts using injections and transmission of the virus from affected mothers to their babies. Public awareness has been spread to 11,000 school students, 2,500 university students and people at a large number of public places, like public toilets, in Nangarhar province, Hassan said. However, social discrimination against the HIV-affected people is great challenge, but the MoPH this year plans to launch a conference under ‘Please stop discrimination’ on World AIDS Day. The MoPH has not yet put a figure on the number of affected people, but based on some reports, 1,874 positive AIDS cases were registered in 2014, including 327 women and 66 children.

Tackle Hepatitis C to Save People Living with HIV,"Opinion: The WHO recognizes that the ‘silent  epidemic’ of viral hepatitis affects a large part of the world’s population  causing over 1.4 million deaths every year, yet remains ...",,"June 28, 2014","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","The WHO recognizes that the ‘silent epidemic’ of viral hepatitis affects a large part of the world’s population causing over 1.4 million deaths every year, yet remains largely unknown or ignored. It is estimated that 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and more than 185 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). These numbers far exceed the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) estimated at 34 million. Viral hepatitis co-infection in PLHIV is now recognized as a major public health problem resulting in increased morbidity and mortality among PLHIV including those on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Chronic HBV infection affects 10% of PLHIV worldwide. Chronic HCV infection affects 20% of PLHIV, with a majority of them living in low- and middle-income countries. In countries where injecting drug use is the biggest risk factor for HIV transmission, as many as 7 out of 10 PLHIV are co infected with HCV. In countries where sexual behavior is the biggest risk factor for HIV transmission, HCV co infection is less common, but still a concern, with about 1 in 10 PLHIV being co infected with HCV. HCV is a blood borne virus, most commonly transmitted through contact with the blood of an HCV-infected person, through sharing contaminated needles/drug use equipment and blood transfusion. Less commonly, it is transmitted through sexual contact with an HCV-infected person, or through birth to an HCV-infected mother. HCV is a much smaller virus than HIV, so there is a lot of it even in a tiny amount of blood, but unlike HIV, HCV can stay alive on surfaces outside the body for many days. HCV is 10 times more infectious than HIV. Experts agree that co infection with HCV makes HIV treatment more complicated. A liver damaged from HCV may cause HIV medications to become less effective and more toxic. HCV co infection triples the risk for liver toxicity from HIV medicines. Also, HIV- HCV co infection more than triples the risk for liver disease and liver-related death from HCV. HCV has 6 different variants - genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with further subdivisions in each genotype. This variability has made it difficult to develop a vaccine that will protect against all HCV strains. However, unlike HIV infection, Hepatitis C can be cured by treatment. WHO recommends pegylated and standard interferon (PEG-IFN) in combination with ribavirin (RBV) to be used for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. Persons infected with genotypes 1 and 4 are treated with PEG-IFN/RBV for 48–72 weeks, while those infected with genotypes 2 and 3 are treated with PEG-IFN/RBV for 24–48 weeks. The longer treatment durations are recommended for persons co infected with HIV and those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Persons with genotype 1 infection and an extended rapid virological response are treated with a shortened course of 24 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV. Dr Franco Buonaguro, Director, Unit of Molecular Biology and Viral Oncology, Napoli, Italy, told Citizen News Service (CNS) that, “The treatment response of HCV for pegylated interferon and ribavirin is 46% in patients with Genotype 1 and 76% in patients with genotypes 2 and 3, which in case of PLHIV co-infected with HCV reduces drastically to 20% for genotype 1 and 62 % for type 2 and 3.” Thus not only duration of treatment for HCV in PLHIV is longer, but treatment response is also poorer. Coupled with this is the high cost of treatment (US$ 2 000 in Egypt for 48-weeks of PEG/IFN RBV), and the high rate of adverse events which require regular monitoring, which prevents most patients from receiving treatment in most low- and middle-income countries. The field of HCV therapeutics is however evolving rapidly. New oral drugs sofosbuvir (a specific HCV polymerase inhibitor approved by the FDA in December 2013 ) and simeprevir, known as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have the potential to revolutionize treatment, with expected cure rates higher than 90% for some genotypes of the disease. The new guidelines of WHO strongly recommend treatment using sofosbuvir and RBV for genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the disease, with or without PEG-IFN, depending on the genotype. Dr Buonaguro said that, “Sofosbuvir treatment regimens and duration are dependent on both viral genotype and patient population. Patients with genotype 1 or 4 are treated with sofosbuvir plus PEG-IFN and RBV for 12 weeks; those with genotype 2 or 3 are part of an all oral drug regimen of sofosbuvir plus RBV for 12 or 24 weeks respectively. The PHOTON-1 study evaluated sofosbuvir and RBV for 12 weeks in patients with genotype 2 HCV infection co-infected with HIV-1 and for 24 weeks in patients with genotypes 1 or 3 HCV co-infected with HIV-1. Trial participants achieved treatment cure rates of 76-92%.” But the only deterrent is the prohibitively high price of the DAAs with a 12 weeks Sofosbuvir treatment costing US $84,000 in the US. At these prices, access in low and middle-income countries is likely to be extremely limited. Moreover the new medicines have yet to be licensed in most countries. Generic production of drugs for HCV can reduce the cost drastically, as had happened in the case of anti retrovirals for HIV. A study done at Liverpool University shows that a 12-week course of sofosbuvir could cost as low as $68-$136. But a word of caution here from Dr Gourdas Choudhuri, Director and Head of Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatobiliary Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, India: “While generics are well established for chemical compounds, where efficacy can be tested, HCV drugs have to be tested in terms of bio efficacy too, and not just by way of chemical structures. So there will need to be a little more reassurance from companies launching generic interferons about their effectiveness.” Nonetheless all PLHIV should be tested for HCV. A new global resolution endorsed by all 194 member states at the 67th session of WHA in May 2014, has called for enhanced action to improve equitable access to viral hepatitis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and requested the WHO Secretariat to facilitate access to affordable treatment. During a CNS press conference at the 19th International AIDS Conference in 2012, Eldred Tellis, Director of the Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, Mumbai, India, had rightly said that, ""It makes public health sense to link HCV prevention efforts to HIV programmes. Prevention and harm reduction efforts for HIV and HCV with vulnerable communities should go hand in hand. Unless this is done, HCV infections will rise even though HIV transmission rates reduce, particularly among injecting drug users – the most vulnerable community."" The HIV Programme is committed to increase its focus on viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection in 2014–2015. Let us hope that the forthcoming XX International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2014) in Melbourne will provide renewed impetuous to making timely viral hepatitis diagnosis and treatment affordable and accessible to all those in need of it.",{},"['save', 'plhiv', 'infected', 'weeks', 'sofosbuvir', 'c', 'tackle', 'hcv', 'treatment', 'living', 'hiv', 'infection', 'hepatitis', 'genotype']","These numbers far exceed the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) estimated at 34 million.

It says the United States made a big mistake when it reversed its anti-drug strategy in 2009 by phasing out crop eradication efforts to focus instead on intercepting drugs and hunting production operations and drug lords. The Unites States said it made the change because drug crop eradication was not damaging the Taliban insurgency but was putting farmers out of work, sowing resentment against foreign intervention.

Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted ...",,"October 14, 2018","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","The world is finally waking up to the threat posed by one of the most overlooked diseases of our time. Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted the first-ever high-level meeting on tuberculosis (TB) to explore options for international eradication efforts. But, as welcome as this new global focus is, the fact remains that the road to beating TB begins in Africa. Simply put, TB remains one of the deadliest epidemics in Africa today, and one-quarter of all TB deaths worldwide occur there. In 2016, some 417,000 people on the continent succumbed to the disease. Recent outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB in South Africa, Mozambique, and Ghana could push the annual death toll even higher. These pockets of the bacterium, now completely immune to antimicrobial treatment, mean that the challenge of global eradication has become even more daunting. Part of the reason for TB’s persistence is the vulnerability of the populations it infects. For starters, TB is among the leading killers of HIV-positive people, claiming some 40% of those who die from HIV. This poses dangers for non-HIV patients as well, especially those with suppressed immune systems, young children, and infants. Eradication is also difficult because TB is a highly contagious airborne bacterium; people living and working in close quarters – such as miners, prisoners, migrants, and refugees – suffer the highest rates of infection. Finally, because TB prevalence is closely linked to poverty and social marginalization, reaching those most at risk is not always easy. Infectious diseases have no borders, and as African countries deepen their trade ties and intra-Africa migration grows, the threat of regional pandemics will only increase. This makes it all the more critical that Africa begin developing a multi-sector, integrated approach to containing, controlling, and eventually eradicating public-health challenges like TB. To this end, one approach that African governments could emulate is the TB management strategy in place for the continent’s mining sector, an inter-agency plan devised in 2014 by the Southern African Development Community. Although this so-called “harmonized” approach applies to a commercial industry, its focus on coordinating with the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) – African Union states grouped for economic integration – could serve as a model for more effective collective action on TB containment. But before a specific framework can be agreed upon, three issues require urgent attention. First, African health-care planners and disease specialists must set country, regional, and local containment targets. For example, setting goals for reductions in new TB infections would enable health officials to measure more accurately the impact of their strategies. Moreover, to end TB completely, Africa will need new and sustained financial commitments from the public and private sectors. And, finally, disease-control strategies must be designed to support the economic and health-care priorities of the RECs. At the moment, most state and regional health-care systems lack funding and human resources. African policymakers must therefore develop systems for prevention, diagnosis, and care that help governments share the disease burden and ensure that treatment protocols are consistent across regions. To be sure, there are some positive trends in the fight against TB. Global infection rates are falling by about 2% annually, and even African countries hit by TB still managed a 4% decline in infections from 2013 to 2017. And, with organizations like the World Health Organization and the African Union beginning to produce roadmaps for TB eradication, it is clear that momentum is steadily building. Still, sustaining this progress in Africa will require significant regional coordination, not to mention a lot more money. Most vaccines and medications are currently too expensive for the majority of Africans. But even those lucky enough to obtain treatment – usually a six- to eight-month course of powerful antibiotics – still face a 20% chance of relapse. The goal of eradicating TB is within reach; the recent gathering at the UNGA marked a critical turning point in the world’s war on the disease. But even as commitments are made and declarations signed, we must remember that in Africa, the battle is far from over.",{},"['tuberculosis', 'tb', 'africa', 'african', 'healthcare', 'global', 'finally', 'winning', 'treatment', 'systems', 'disease', 'regional', 'war']","Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted the first-ever high-level meeting on tuberculosis (TB) to explore options for international eradication efforts.

The available figures indicate that 66 percent of new cases are women and 10 percent are children. WHO has said that more than 670 children younger than 15 were diagnosed with TB last year in Afghanistan and, of those, the majority of the cases, 465, were girls. The Afghan Ministry of Public Health has reported that nearly 10,500 people die from TB each year in the country and nearly 650 children succumbed to the disease last year. Experts believe that poor working and living conditions, poverty, traditional beliefs, lack of awareness about the disease, security, lack of access to proper medications and health facilities for an earlier diagnosis of the disease and intervention are among the reasons for the high incidence of tuberculosis. The internationally-recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS), which is believed to be the most efficient and cost-effective tuberculosis control strategy, has been used in Afghanistan with some success. The implementation of DOTS requires sustained political and financial commitment to ensure that there can be: diagnosis by quality ensured sputum-smear microscopy; standardized short-course anti-TB treatment (SSC) given under direct and supportive observation (DOT); a regular, uninterrupted supply of high quality anti-TB drugs; and a standardized recording and reporting mechanism. According to available figures, the percentage of people with access to DOTS in Afghanistan has increased from 14 to 97 percent since 2002 and the number of health facilities which apply DOTS has increased from 10 in 2000 to nearly 1,200 in 2011. Based on the DOTS successes, the WHO developed a six-point ‘Stop TB Strategy’ to address the key challenges faced by TB worldwide. The main purpose of the strategy is to lessen the global TB burden by 2015 and ensure that all TB patients and those co-infected with HIV and drug-resistant TB take advantage of universal access to high-quality diagnosis and patient-centered treatment. The six-point ‘Stop TB Strategy’ includes sustaining, improving and accelerating quality DOTS expansion; addressing TB-HIV, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and other special challenges; contributing to health system strengthening; engaging all care providers; empowering patients and communities; and enabling and promoting research. Keeping in mind the current threat posed by TB in Afghanistan, experts suggest that more priority should be given to a carefully-designed national TB communication strategy based on the six-point ‘Stop TB Strategy’ in Afghanistan. The communication objective should be clear whether it wants to raise awareness about the danger of TB; promote TB safe behavior among those who are aware of the dangers of TB or promote TB safe behavior among a group of people who are at particular risk. The comprehensive communication strategy needs to be based on the results of well designed research, using Knowledge, Attitude, Practices and Beliefs (KAPB), Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) research methods. Specials attention should be given to rural areas where the majority of the population live and where the level of understanding of TB is very low. An overall majority of people in Afghanistan do not know the early signs and symptoms of TB and think that it is an incurable disease. Meanwhile, any research to be conducted in the country will need to pay special attention to women and girls who make up the majority of the TB cases in Afghanistan and are traditionally responsible, in certain parts of the country, for working in some unhygienic environments such as stables, pens, backyards, and collecting and bringing home firewood, bushes and animal droppings. They are also responsible for cooking, washing and taking care of other household chores and all these could make them more prone to the disease. Despite TB eradication efforts, Afghanistan has remained one of the 22 TB high-burden countries in the world. The alarming figures indicate that Afghanistan has a long way to go before getting rid of this preventable disease.

More than 70,000 drug addicts are only in Heart. Being a bordering province with Iran, Heart has large number of drug addicts because most of them are the Afghan refugee returnees. Afghanistan produces about 90 percent of the world poppy production. The number of drug addicts in the country is based on estimations and not clear. Though overall statistics is not as terrible as from Herat, however it reflects the severity of the situation. The Government has no efficient program for drug addicts. For instance, there is only one hospital of 150-bed for over 70,000 drug addicts in Herat. This shows how ignorant the Government has been to this issue. There must have been strict checking and rehabilitation centers in Herat for all the returnees. The one very severe negative impact of Afghan refuge in Iran has been the mounting number of drug addicts across the country, beside the spread of HIV AIDS and prostitution. The concerned quarters of the Government ministries should have serious attention towards this plague. With only one hospital for such a big number of drug addicts, the situation is getting more serious and deadly. These drug addicts spread across the country. With easy availability of all kinds of drugs in cheap prices, they not only continue with this life-ending addiction, but also spread use of drugs among their circle of influence, friends and contacts. In the political scene, there has been only rhetoric, the war on opium, but the fight against drug addiction has been totally ignored. And the number of addicts increases every year with higher percentages. The Government should pay attention to this and put more resources. But indeed the Government alone has not the capacity and resources to fight against the drug addiction. International anti-drug and aid organizations should focus this issue in their programs, particularly in the Afghan provinces bordering with Iran. Media has to highlight this severe issue, not only in news coverage to show where and how severe the situation is, but also it should help increase public awareness about it.",{},"['increasing', 'severe', 'herat', 'drug', 'afghan', 'addicts', 'issue', 'iran', 'country', 'spread', 'number']","The number of drug addicts is increasing without a check or any effective program by the government to stop it.

A Formula for Health Equity,"Opinion: Imagine a country  where some 90% of the population is covered by health insurance, more than 90%  of those with HIV are on a consistent drug regime, and 93% of children ...",,"April 10, 2018","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Imagine a country where some 90% of the population is covered by health insurance, more than 90% of those with HIV are on a consistent drug regime, and 93% of children are vaccinatedagainst common communicable diseases including HPV. Where would you guess this enchanted land of medical equity is? Scandinavia? Costa Rica? Narnia? Try Africa – Rwanda, to be precise. In my native country, health care is a right guaranteed for all, not a privilege reserved for the rich and powerful. Rwanda remains poor, but, over the past 15 years, its health care advances have gained global attention, for good reason. In 2000, life expectancy at birth was just 48 years; today, it’s 67. International aid has helped, but our achievements have come primarily from other, non-financial innovations. For starters, Rwanda has established a collaborative, cluster approach to governance that allows us to achieve more with the same amount of funding. Moreover, our civil servants embrace problem solving, demonstrating a level of resourcefulness that has produced many localized solutions to human development challenges such as ensuring food security and adequate supplies of clean water and housing. But perhaps the most important factor behind our dramatic health-care gains has been the national equity agenda, which sets targets for supporting the needy and tracks progress toward meeting them. Since implementing this approach, Rwanda has managed to decrease the percentage of people living in extreme poverty from 40% of the population in 2000 to 16.3% in 2015 Aside from the obvious benefits, these gains matter because, as UNICEF recently noted a country’s potential return on investment in social services for vulnerable children is two times greater when the benefits reach the most vulnerable. In other words, Rwanda has achieved so much so fast because we are enjoying higher rates of return by investing in the poorest. In working toward health equity, Rwanda has made accessibility a top priority. As of 2016, nine out of ten Rwandans were enrolled in one of the country’s health insurance programs. The majority of the population is enrolled in the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme, which has increased access to health care for Rwanda’s most vulnerable citizens by waiving fees. As a result, the reach of health-care coverage in Rwanda is high by global standards – all the more remarkable for a country that suffered the horrors of genocide a generation ago. Consider the situation in the US: while the rate of uninsured Americans has dropped precipitously under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the insured face rapid increases in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Perhaps the US should consider adopting a CBHI-type program, to reduce further the number of Americans facing financial barriers to medical care. Rwanda has crafted health care delivery with access in mind as well, by deploying community health workers (CHWs) to the country’s 15,000 villages. These local practitioners serve as the gatekeepers to a system that has reduced waiting times and financial burdens by treating patients directly – often at patients’ homes. The US could also benefit from a CHW program. The US is brimming with educated young people who, as CHWs, could bridge the gap between medical facilities and patients, thereby improving American social capital and health outcomes. As Rwanda’s experience has demonstrated, such programs not only broaden access to health care; they also lower overall costs by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations. Such programs have been shown to be transferable. Starting in 1997, Brigham and Women’s Hospital supported the HIV+ community of Boston through the Prevention and Access to Care and Treatment (PACT) program. That initiative was based on the CHW model implemented in rural Haiti by Partners In Health – a non-profit health-care organization that integrates CHWs into primary care and mental health. As a result of that initiative, the government insurer Medicaid spent less money on hospital stays, and inpatient expenditures fell by 62%. Other US communities could, and should, incorporate similar models into their treatment programs for chronic conditions. Innovation is what kick-started Rwanda’s health-care revival, and progressive thinking is what drives it forward today. For example, health centers established throughout the country provide vaccinations and treat illnesses that village-level CHWs cannot, and have extended obstetrics services to the majority of Rwandan women. Broadening access further, each district in Rwanda has one hospital, and each region in the country has a referral or teaching hospital with specialists to handle more difficult cases. While some hospitals still suffer from staff shortages, the government has sought to patch these holes through an initiative that employs faculty from over 20 US institutions to assist in training our clinical specialists. In just over two decades, thanks to homegrown solutions and international collaboration, Rwanda has dramatically reduced the burden of disease on its people and economy. As we look forward, our goal is to educate tomorrow’s leaders to build on the equitable health-care system that we have created. This is the mission of the University of Global Health Equity, a new university based in rural Rwanda that has made fairness, collaboration, and innovation its guiding principles. As a Rwandan doctor who contributed to building my country’s health-care system from its infancy, I am proud of what we have accomplished in so short a time. It wasn’t magic; it was a formula. Through continued global cooperation, other countries, including developed ones, can learn to apply it.",{},"['healthcare', 'care', 'global', 'programs', 'hospital', 'health', 'rwanda', 'formula', 'country', 'equity', 'access']","In my native country, health care is a right guaranteed for all, not a privilege reserved for the rich and powerful.

Women Rights Violations,"Opinion: The Sunday’s suicide bombing in central Kabul led to the  injury of a female member of parliament, Shokria Barikzai, and at least 21  civilians and killed three others, including a  ...",,"November 19, 2014","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","The Sunday’s suicide bombing in central Kabul led to the injury of a female member of parliament, Shokria Barikzai, and at least 21 civilians and killed three others, including a 21-year-old university student Qudsia. Her body was left on the road with the burnt pages of Holy Qur’an around her – showing that she intended to protect the Sacred Book from the explosion. Qudsia’s death came as a complete shock to her family and friends. Her old mother was mourning painfully over Qudsia’s funeral. Since terrorists victimize all Afghan citizens irrespective of their gender, it cannot be called violence against women. However, to scrutinize the incident deeply, women are more vulnerable than men in our society. On Sunday’s incident, a female MP was the main target. Recently, girls and women suffer more than ever before. As a result, two females, aged 12 and 3 fell prey to gang rape in Takhar province just days ago – which aroused people’s concern. Domestic violence, terror, rape and abuse of women remain disgraceful blots on the reputation of our country. The suffering of children invariably impacts more greatly on women than on men. Too many women continue to bear the brunt of social and economic deprivation, in the rural as well as urban areas. Nelson Mandela believes that as long as we take the view that these are problems for women alone to solve, we cannot expect to reverse the high incidence of rape and child abuse. Domestic violence will not be eradicated. We will not defeat this scourge that affects each and every one of us, until we succeed in mobilizing the whole of our society to fight it. He raises his concern regarding women’s sufferings and says, “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.” On Wednesday, UN reporter on violence against women, Rashida Manjoo, has called on the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to address the causes and consequences of gender-based violence in the country. Ms. Manjoo warned in a statement that violence against women in Afghanistan continues to be a source of deep concern, despite positive legislative and institutional developments brought forward amid a situation of insecurity throughout the country. “Accountability for all crimes committed against women and girls, the empowerment of women, and the transformation of society, need to remain a focus for the Government of Afghanistan, independent State institutions, civil society organizations and also the international community,” the expert stressed. When reporting crimes committed against them, Ms. Manjoo said that many women and girls do not register complaints due to their lack of knowledge of the law and its protective remedial provisions; fear of reprisal from the perpetrators and family members; financial and other constraints, including the lack of freedom of movement; and fear of being treated as criminals instead of victims. Child marriage still looms large in our society. One of the reasons which prompts many families to force their young daughters into marriage is the lack of security stemming from three decades of war, including the risk of kidnapping and rape. Some girls are bartered into marriage to repay debt or resolve a dispute. And widespread poverty still compels many parents to have their daughters married to avoid the cost of caring for them. The implications of child marriage cannot be overestimated as many girls do not continue their education and remain illiterate. They have babies while still young teenagers, increasing health problems and risking death for themselves and their children. The Afghan government and law-enforcement agencies need to take the discrimination and violence against women seriously. But at the same time the root causes of the problem have to be addressed. Until and unless women are considered an integral part of society nothing fundamental will change. Education is the best strategy to liberate women from male domination. Only 40% of Afghan girls attend elementary school, and only one in 20 girls attend school beyond the sixth grade. Many Afghan families will only permit their daughters to attend all-girls schools close to home and few such schools exist. Other families believe it is unnecessary for girls to be educated. Schools for girls have been burned down, hundreds of teachers educating girls have been threatened or killed and girls have been harassed while attending or walking to or from school. A vicious circle of lack of education, poverty, illiteracy and violence fuel the highly patriarchal society, even fundamentalism and militancy, which still characterize Afghanistan today. Breaking the cycle will take great resolve and courage, as many Afghan women and men have demonstrated – sometimes paying with their lives. Although progress is slow, hope is found in places least expected. I would like to conclude with the nice poems of Zieba Shorish-Shamley which rightly reflects the state of Afghan women, “They made me invisible, shrouded and non-being. A shadow, no existence, made silent and unseeing. Denied of freedom, confined to my cage! Tell me how to handle my anger and my rage?”",{},"['society', 'women', 'men', 'violations', 'rights', 'remain', 'afghan', 'marriage', 'rape', 'woman', 'girls', 'violence']","Since terrorists victimize all Afghan citizens irrespective of their gender, it cannot be called violence against women.

The official recorded number has increased one million, of which about 60,000 are women! And even more shocking, over 70,000 of these addicts are from Herat province alone. If the main reason for this huge number could be the fact that Herat borders Iran and Afghan refugees who return bring the evil with them, then the question is, refugee returnees repatriate to all parts of Afghanistan, why such huge concentration only in Herat? Official reports do not explain this. However, what we know is that the Government has no efficient program for drug addicts in the province, or any part of the country for that matter. There is only one hospital of 150-bed for over 70,000 drug addicts in Herat. There must be strict checking and rehabilitation centers in Herat for all the returnees. The mounting number of drug addicts across the country is just one of the problems that come with Afghan refugees, besides the spread of HIV AIDS, prostitution and social problems. With easy availability of all kinds of drugs in cheap prices, it is spreading fast in other parts of the country. The above shocking statistics are just from Herat. The overall picture is much bleaker. Our economy depends heavily on drug trade. While talking at an international conference recently, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged countries involved in Afghanistan to step up the fight to combat poppy cultivation and drug business. He said there cannot be sustainable development when opium production is the only viable economic activity in Afghanistan, and added that there cannot be stability when 15 percent of our gross domestic product comes from drug trade. The UN Secretary General said Afghanistans drug economy is worth $2.4 billion. He emphasized that the Afghan Government must prioritize the issue of narcotics. Law enforcement agencies must work harder on eradication crops, eliminating laboratories, keeping precursors from entering the country. According to a UN report released last year, poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has increased significantly. The report said there has been an increase of seven percent in the year 2011 compared to the year before that. The increase was reported despite the fact that Ministry of Antinarcotics had claimed to have destroyed 65 percent of the total cultivation that year. The US and its NATO allies caught up in the prioritize of an exit strategy, are largely ignoring the focus on poppy eradication, and our Government with some bigwigs of the power corridor involved in drug profits have always been opposing effective and harsh programs of eradication. Our neighboring countries including Russia have been calling for active anti-narcotics action in Afghanistan. The Government and international forces should enforce the poppy eradication campaign. The war on poppy is forgotten. Aside from the fact that a huge part of the financial support to insurgents comes from transport and smuggling of opium, its also exporting deaths to millions of people around the world, and the number of drug addicts increasing in Afghanistan. Taliban militants get $400 million a year through direct and indirect revenue from poppy cultivation, transportation and trade. The Counter-Narcotics law is yet to go in effect. It was approved in 2009, but under the pretext of the so-called alternative programs, the Government has not implemented the law. Once this law goes into effect, there will be legal action against farmers who cultivate poppy crop. The punishment is not strict, but this law must be implemented and practiced strongly. The law includes 5 chapters and 67 Articles. It was approved in 2009, but due to the poppy eradication campaigns, its implementation has been postponed. Once this law goes into effect, there will be legal action against farmers who cultivate poppy crop. The punishment is not strict, but this law must be implemented and practiced strongly to make it effective. According to latest reports, there has been an increase of seven percent in the year 2011 compared to the previous year. If the current policy of bribing the poppy-growing farmers continues, which benefits the drug mafia and opium business tycoons who make the real deal from all this, it will keep Afghanistan the biggest producer of drugs in the world for the second consecutive decade. The Government and international community should step up efforts against poppy eradication. Meanwhile, the government should pay greater attention toward rehabilitation of drug addicts and its spread. They must launch effective programs. Three is no strategy and programs for bringing back the drug addicts to normal life. There are very few special hospitals for them across the country. The number of women drug addicts—60,000—is something that should deeply worry us all. The international community has other priorities, but this issue needs much greater attention.",{},"['international', 'number', 'programs', 'law', 'drug', 'statistics', 'addicts', 'eradication', 'poppy', 'shocking', 'afghanistan', 'herat']","A new report on drug addicts in Afghanistan has shocking statistics.

The death of my compatriots chills me to the bone and compounds the meaninglessness of life for me. I see the oozing blood of men, women and children, I see mothers crying before the bloody corpse of their children, I hear painful sobs but I also see people who are blind and deaf to all this . I see people bully one another; they torture the defenseless people severely, oppress and shed the blood of innocent humans. The weaker if a person is the more cruelty s/he will receive. Yes, in this society “man is man’s wolf.” Men prey upon men. The human’s dignities and values are the most meaningless words in this world. Oh my God, what a crying shame! I see some old men taking their carts, with shivering hands, to the bazaar in the early morning. Their gloomy faces reflect their worry about the earnings of the day. I also see some children and aged men who are collecting garbage, to burn for heating. I see some youth, searching for jobs, who return home in frustration and disappointment. I see some women and children shivering in winter. There are vendors who are unable to make ends meet. I remember Mohamed Bou azizi, a Tunisian fruit vendor who set himself on fire on December 17, 2010, in protest against unemployment. This caused a wave of protest against oppression, government corruption and inefficiency, across the Arab World. Then I ask myself, what if a person sets himself on fire in this country, to protest the current situation. Will the same revolution break out in our country? Of course, most of our people are dissatisfied with the current government. Our country is on the top list of the most corrupt countries, there is 36 percent rise in opium production, 38 percent rise in HIV disease, 28 percent rise in violence against women, and the death toll among civilians and the national police is getting higher. No one can tolerate such a chaotic and disorderly situation. Isn’t it anarchy? Undoubtedly, we are experiencing the exact meaning of anarchy in our country. Anarchy derives from the Greek language. The prefix, an, denotes not or without. Anarchy denotes rule, or ruling. Thus, anarchy means lawlessness; without rule. By this definition, an anarchic government is a no government. This often happens after a civil war, when a government has been destroyed and adversary groups are fighting to take its place. John Milton defines anarchy as, “Anarchy is the sure consequence of tyranny; or no power that is not limited by laws can ever be protected by them.” Moreover, Jeremy Bentham says, “Tyranny and anarchy are never far apart.” Cruelty and tyranny is rampant in our country. On the one hand our officials consider themselves above the law and they are corrupt. They violate the human rights. They usurp land, accept bribe, and support the criminals. On the other hand, Taliban militants are destabilizing the country and terrorizing people. They use many methods to kill innocent Afghan civilians, male, female and children! Taking over power in Afghanistan is their aim. In the patriarchal society of Afghanistan, women suffer cruelties indoors and outdoors. Despite being busy with household chores, they fall victim to inhuman acts such as physical torture, mutilation, and even death. Their schools are still set on fire and in insecure parts of the country; they do not dare go to school. Our culture, religious values and social norms are eroding. Western culture has invaded Afghanistan, especially amongst our younger generation. Our moral standards and values are being replaced by outside ones. This is a cause of serious concern. When a country is in limbo, can we still claim that we do not live in a state of chaos and anarchy? In my point of view, when a country’s officials are corrupt, there will be no law and order. Cruelty and injustice are very prominent across the country. If you have money or power, you will be idolized otherwise your humanity will go under question. People are surrounded in the triangle of power, possession and deception. Religious laws are debated in a hot manner; however in practice they are ignored. Indeed, if religious values were respected and practiced in their true forms, the society would not drop in such an unlucky situation. Hence, religion is also marginalized from the personal and collective life of our people. As far as religious laws and morality are not brought back in active use, our society will not develop. John Foster Dulles say very truly, “Economic and military power can be developed under the spur of laws and appropriations. But moral power does not derive from any act of Congress. It depends on the relations of a people to their God. It is the churches to which we must look to develop the resources for the great moral offensive that is required to make human rights secure, and to win a just and lasting peace.” It is debated that we need a fundamental change not only in politics but also in the social, cultural and educational fields. As the ambition for presidency wets the appetite of our politicians, the situation may become worse. When the foreign forces withdraw, insecurity will result. There may also emerge sectarian violence and racial tension which might change the country into a battlefield. The deteriorating security situation has cast a cloud over Afghan people. Civilians are losing their lives every week through deadly attacks carried out by Taliban militants. The President seems unconcerned about these matters! People are disappointed! I think it is still not too late for our officials and political leaders to ask themselves why the country is so deep in challenges. Why should Afghanistan be known as the most corrupt or the highest opium producing country? Why, are challenges being compounded daily? Why the situation is worsening? What are the solutions and what measures should be taken to pull the country out of the current disorder?",{},"['society', 'anarchy', 'women', 'men', 'power', 'children', 'values', 'live', 'dont', 'state', 'laws', 'anarchic', 'situation', 'country']","I see people bully one another; they torture the defenseless people severely, oppress and shed the blood of innocent humans.

The Open Structure of Islam February 02, 2015 | Hujjat Zia Religious interpretation is one of the controversial discourses in modern age among the religious intellectuals. Since traditional understanding of religion is unable to resolve the highly sophisticated issues of contemporary society, an “update theology” and neo-interpretation are the crying needs of our age. However, the traditional frames of mind on one hand and secular approaches to religion on the other hand, have led to sensitive issues. Seemingly, the muftis and mullahs’ approaches towards religion, which are based on merely cryptic and sacred sources, is too conservative and traditional to unravel the philosophical, political and economic issues of today’s world. However, the secularists strive felicitously to interpret religion in a way to satiate the thirst of younger generation and to meet the needs of modern life. Unlike Catholic religion, the natural structure of Islam is open. Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestri, an Iranian Islamic intellectual, believes that in the open structure of Islam, religious message directly addresses the men without appointing any official representatives for explaining and interpreting the divine message. To put further light on this topic, he makes a comparison between Catholic Christianity and Islam. He states that in the structure of Catholic religion, there are three angles namely divine message, mankind and church. Hence, it makes a closed triangle. In this close system; church is introduced in the nature of Christianity as official interpreter of divine message which obligates the admirers to follow. He argues that, based on Christian beliefs, when God incarnated in history and carried a message, this message bears an official protector that is church to keep the message safe. Mr. Shabestari stresses that the natural structure of Christianity necessitates that there is always a number of specific people in church to interpret the real essence of Christianity officially and their interpretations eventuate to the existence of dogmas which preclude the followers from disobedience. Therefore, the men being addressed by the divine message in Catholic are not qualified for interpreting the message. So, the natural structure of Christianity is a close system. However, a third angle is not predicated in Islam and people are addressed directly being allowed to interpret the message. The communication between God and mankind and understanding the divine message by mankind is an open system. Islam, as it permeated the history, according to Mr. Shabestari, is like a globe shining brightly in the frames of theosophy, philosophy, jurisprudence, Holy Qur’an, Hadiths, etc. Thus, all of them are open in emergence and development and muftis are not obliged to think in a certain way or declare a certain fatwa. He, then, explains the difference between Christian dogma and Islamic fatwa: Dogma includes religious beliefs and Christian’s practical matters; however Islamic fatwa includes only practical issues and religious beliefs are beyond the realm of fatwa or emulation. Fatwa is a deductive view based on a series of human knowledge but dogma is the outcome of the Holy Spirit’s presence in church which is beyond deduction. Fatwa can be numerous and contradicting on a single issue, for instance, ten muftis can declare several fatwa but dogma cannot be different in the same era. Muftis can backtrack on their fatwa, however the Catholic Pope can’t recant his dogma; and, therefore, the Catholic followers construe the historical evolution of dogma as a linguistic change or stating that the church discovers a new truth in every new age which was not stated before. Hence, the aforementioned differences between dogma and fatwa point out how the rational system in Islam is open and no intrinsically religious element fetters the muftis’ fatwa. Since no official interpreters are defined in the nature of Islam and the people being addressed are also considered interpreters, without any meddlers. Moreover, the content of religious message will never manifest in an authoritative source to fetter the Muslims’ thought rather Muslims are entitled with the rights to understand and embrace the content of religious message. The diverse understandings and interpretations take place among the people and by the people. As it was mentioned earlier, there is the divine message on the one side and the men on the other side – which make an open structure. Some may argue that religious law will contain a number of certain facts and values regarding social and political issues. This is an incontrovertible fact, however, since no specific source or institution is introduced formally in the nature of Islam, people are entitled to analyze and understand those facts in many ways. They are neither compelled nor stereotyped to understand the fact in one way. Ill-fatedly, in spite of open structure or open system of thought, Muslims felt obliged, under dictatorial regimes and fundamental frame of minds, to understand a religious message as the regimes explained for them. In another item, the despotic rulers interpreted religious Sharia in their own political interests and declaimed being bestowed divine legitimacy to rule. Moreover, people focused more on their responsibilities rather than their rights. Since they naively believed the rulers as being caliph and cruel kings were considered the wrath of God and kind ones were deemed His mercy, they publically deemed themselves as total slaves in the hand of the kings. Why the cruel rulers should be obeyed? They believed that whenever the people’s sin increase, God sends them a cruel ruler to retaliate them and they have to be subjugated to them at any case. Hence, such mentalities continued for long and kept them in dark without a sense of protest. In our age, such ideas are obsolete and, with few exceptions, people will know, with a thorough study, the open structure of Islamic law. ... ... Why Celebrate 550 Years of Kazakh Statehood?

Pollution: The World Threatening Issue,Opinion: Many governments and  individuals still underestimate air pollution warnings while it recognized as a biggest life threatening  enemy in the planet and likely to put the biggest brake on...,,"December 20, 2016","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Many governments and individuals still underestimate air pollution warnings while it recognized as a biggest life threatening enemy in the planet and likely to put the biggest brake on development in the future. According to World Health Organization (WHO), there are around 3,000 cities in the world which badly affected by air pollutions. Millions of people, including rich countries, are suffering from health issues such as cancers, heart and respiratory diseases that air pollution brings, the levels of air pollution in many Asian and African cities are said to be five or even 10 times worse. As ranked by WHO, Mazar-e Sharif and Kabul are graded the ninth and tenth most polluted cities in the world while Onitsha, a fast-growing city in Nigeria, got the first place in the globe. 98% of these cities, around 92 per cent of the worlds population live in places where levels exceed recommended limits. And around 6.5 million people die annually from air pollution. In addition, the intensity of air pollution has increased by 8% in the past five years. Levels of air pollution have reached toxic stage particularly in some countries that the World Health Organization (WHO) said it has become one of the worlds biggest public health issues. Toxic fumes have reached levels so dangerous that the number of annual deaths caused by air pollution across the globe is now greater than those of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and malaria combined. The quandary of toxic levels of air pollution or smog affects many of the worlds major cities in the world: from Kabul to Hong Kong and Shijiazhuang in China and multiple cities in Latin America. In late 2015, schools and offices were closed in China because of the toxic levels of smog that lasted for weeks. In December 2015, a blanket of thick gray smog covered skies in New Delhi, India. Tehran and Turkey also suffer tremendous levels of air pollution, especially during winter. Recently, Commerce minister Humayon Rasa, Head of National Environment Protection Agency of Afghanistan, Mustafa Zahir, and Kabul Mayor Abdullah Habibzai called in the Wolesi Jirga to answer lawmakers regarding increasing of air pollution and trashes in Kabul city. Number of Parliament member while calling air pollution a silent killer, said that non-asphalted roads, low quality fuel, damaged cars, burning of substandard material by different factories and houses are the main factor behind high level of pollution in Kabul. They asked the related organs to exert utmost efforts to control pollution in Kabul as soon as possible. Commerce minister Rasa said that control of fuel is the duty of Afghanistan National Standard Authority, which the ministry has no the right to interfere. He said that refineries in the country has not the capacity to filter the fuel and produce fuel, thus it is required of government to directly import fuel. Head of National Environment Protection Agency of Afghanistan Mustafa Zahir said that 72 percent of pollution is caused by vehicle and dusty roads, 31 percent by commercial and personal institution burning substandard fire materials, 12 percent by brick factories. Kabul Mayor Abdullah Habibzai complained of lack of enough equipment, facilities and staffs in Kabul. He said that our staff is for one million populations but currently, the population increased to around six million in Kabul. We need 600 vehicles, but only Kabul municipality have 170 vehicles, he noted. He said that Kabul municipality only had the capability to transfer 30 percent of trashes. Kabul municipality work over privatization of cleaning program of Kabul city, which will be implemented in coming two years, he claimed. He insisted that by privatization of cleaning program of Kabul, the problem of increasing of trashes will be solved. Substandard canalization system and house, lack of greenery and lack of standard transportation system are other challenges, which Kabul municipality will hold efforts to address the issue in future, he underlined. It seems that the problem is rapidly worsening in Afghanistan, peculiarly in Kabul, due to mentioned reasons and lack of a true controlling plan. Dozens of the citizens die each year in Kabul while thousands others suffering from severe upper and lower chest infections, including asthma, chronic bronchitis and heart disease due the polluted weather. Reportedly, it caused 3,000 deaths last year whereas the condition is worse comparing to previous year owing to expansion in previous factors and additionally predicted less snow. Though, People complain resentfully today and the full health tragedy will not be seen for many years. Because the effects of air pollution are chronic, or slow, they build up in the body and impact mostly on older people. Children exposed to heavy traffic fumes today will have smaller lungs and be more vulnerable to respiratory and heart diseases in their later years. It means, if we underestimate the issue now, we are storing up a health time-bomb for the future, guaranteeing that hospital wards will be full of wheezing people with hearts and lungs permanently damaged just by living in cities. The vast costs to the economy of caring for an increasingly infirm older population will have to be met later. Lastly air-pollution crisis is not less important then fighting terrorism. The municipality needs to work with private company for rehabilitation of forests, ban the import and use of substandard fuel, improve waste management and at the same time build and strengthen the institutional capacity. It is also important to co-operate with the government in every aspect of issue to overcome the dilemmas and enjoy a life free of silent enemy such as air pollution and terrorist activities. The government is helpless to approach a conclusion in fighting against the silent enemy (air pollution) and terrorists, unless the people co-operate with it.",{},"['world', 'fuel', 'pollution', 'toxic', 'kabul', 'cities', 'health', 'threatening', 'issue', 'levels', 'air', 'municipality']","Many governments and individuals still underestimate air pollution warnings while it recognized as a biggest life threatening enemy in the planet and likely to put the biggest brake on development in the future.

Some Afghan vilified me for exposing the culture of male prostitution of the country but majority of my readers highly appreciated my shallow efforts. In fact, I have never been associated with any political or religious group in Afghanistan since 1964. I am a free tribal man of no political or sectarian background. A background that elevated me to the skies is my intellectual and literary background which is my real asset. Last week, I came across a video on YouTube in which 12 years Old Persian speaking girl was crying of her injuries and bleeding in front of a local NGO. She was forcefully married to a criminal warlord who not only abused her; but severely tortured as well. Her weak and beautiful hand was bleeding and torn cloths were blood stained after she got knife injuries in the hand of her husband. ""Please help me get divorce, next time he will kill me, he injured me with a knife"". She was crying again and again with demanding attention, but her crying and dismal face disappointed me and I got high blood pressure for two days. Northern Afghanistan has recently embroiled in many hazardous diseases like HIV/AIDS, male and female prostitution. The main factors behind these diseases are considered to be poverty and unemployment. Poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and the culture of militarization produced innumerable smugglers, prostitutes, suicide bombers and professional criminals across the country. In Northern provinces, poverty stricken children are sexually abused, while in Pashtun dominated provinces, children are being recruited for suicide terrorism. This has now become an unfortunate culture of the country. Warlords in both Northern and Southern Afghanistan arrange parties, invite dancing boy and pay them for sex. As BBC reported the disturbing thing happens in the end of parties, is the boys are taken to hotels and sexually abused. This ignominious practice is against the principles of Islam and against child rights. Child abuse in the country remained a big problem while illiterate parents are using their children in forced labor to pay off family debts. There are in ordinate cases of child abuse but only few are reported to the police. Parents dont want to report case of the abuse of their children to the police because they understand that police is already abusing innocent children in many ways. According to the article 54 of the constitution of Afghanistan; ""Family is the fundamental unit of society and is protected by the state. The state shall adopt necessary measures to ensure physical and psychological well being of family, especially of child and mother, upbringing of children and the elimination of traditions contrary to the provisions of sacred religion of Islam."" After the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, in the penal code of 1976 law is still in practice with various provisions. Article 398 sets punishment for honor killings, adultery, fornication and homosexuality. Article 427 describes long-term prison for adultery and also increases the available punishment if there is a ""violation of honor killing"". Afghan Constitution is only on papers, both the police and government neither official nor ordinary Afghan know about their country constitution. Regretfully, being an Islamic country, the business of drugs, children and women trafficking, Bacha-Bazi and dancing clubs have undermined the so-called Afghani Ghairat, Pashtunwali and love to Islam. Bacha-Bazi is in no way acceptable in Islam while Islam is being misinterpreted in the country. Children have rights in Islam but they have no access to education, house, job, health and basic rights. The streets of Afghan cities are full of working children, some polish shoes, some beg, some gather plastic bottles to resell and some are kidnapped for male prostitution. Last month, in Herat province, a 14 year old boy complained about his rape but didnt report to the police. Afghan hospitals are full of raped and abused children who receive medical treatment for their physical injuries. Article 427 of Afghanistans penal code determines ""long term"" imprisonment for adultery. The article further elucidates that child abuser can be jailed for six to 10 years. Normally, Bach-Bazi or child sex in the country is within the context of sexual acts with boys, in which adult men buy sexual favors from young boys with money or gifts. In this business, Private and pro-government militias have been found deeply involved. These Companies promote child recruitment and child abuse. Underage children are often abused sexually, tortured and put into hard labor. In many parts of the country, there are community-based militias of Bacha-Bazi addicted men such as the Afghan Local Police, in troubled provinces who have free hand and they do every thing whatever they want. Children in Afghanistan are suffering disastrous level of abuse; they are abused and insulted both in society and within homes. In Afghan prisons, they are tortured and raped. Torture and sexual assaults in Prisons presents a grim picture of scant respect for human rights. The ways of torture of the Afghan police and security agencies are beating by stick, scorching bar, or iron bar; flogging by cable; battering by rod; electric shock; deprivation of sleep, water, and food; abusive language; sexual humiliation; and rape. Another painful story revealed by Wiki Leaks recently describes the involvement of foreign contractors in child abuse, training of Afghan policemen who take drugs and pay for young boys. Afghanistans sex industry is booming, according to both private and official sources. Statistics are scattered, and few solid figures exist. To address the issue properly, News and Media Radio reported (2011) Afghan government signed a formal agreement with the UN to ban the recruitment of children into the armed forces and stop the sexual abuse of young boys by the military commanders and warlords. The culture of play boy, dancing boy or Bacha-Bazi must be undermined, warned the UN.",{},"['islam', 'boy', 'humiliation', 'children', 'abuse', 'country', 'afghan', 'boys', 'sexual', 'rape', 'afghanistan', 'child']","In my last three articles on Child abuse and play boy business in Afghanistan, I highlighted the issue scrupulously with a limited details, but anyhow I received dozens of e-mails from Northern Afghanistan, Europe and Pakistan.

This produce will eventually find markets through various conduits including the Maldives and Nepal, they said. Indian Finance and Revenue Secretary R.S. Gujral said the development in Afghanistan had critical implications for the long term security of our region and the world. Latest information indicates a seven percent increase in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to 131,000 hectares. Though some progress in tackling the problem has been achieved, the medium term indicators of opium produced are not positive. The amount of opium produced has risen from 3,600 tons in 2010 (mainly owing to opium diseases that affected opium crop) to 5,800 tons in 2011, Gujral said. Afghan opium kills 100,000 people every year globally. The problem of drug addiction and diseases spread by intravenous injections such as HIV-AIDS in most participating countries indicates worrying trends that should provide an incentive for all governments to consider drug abuse as an integral part of public health policies and to deal with it at regional and international level, Gujral said. He was speaking at the second meeting of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies of the Asia and Pacific region. Christina Albertin, resident representative the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, drew attention to Nepal saying it was becoming a conduit for drugs supply to China. She highlighted the conditions in the Maldives, which she said was becoming a major drug consumer. Gujral told IANS: Authorities in Afghanistan have been regularly briefed. We are coordinating action with them. More important is to cut the supply lines and prevent new conduits from opening.",{},"['nepal', 'producing', 'official', 'drug', 'opium', 'tons', 'produced', 'supply', 'problem', 'term', 'afghanistan', 'gujral']","AGRA - Delegates taking part in a four-day conclave of heads of drug law enforcement agencies here voiced concern over the increase in the area under opium cultivation in Afghanistan.

But the evidences clearly show the reverse. Their true wisdom and knowledge are today's main achievements and inventions. The archaeological excavations show that our forefathers were much ...,,"May 13, 2012","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Are we really living a glorious life with enlightenment? Man is living in twenty first century and has left behind the stone and Iron Age lifestyle. Man used every toll for his comfort but none of them could satisfy his dire desire. Today he has reached to the moon, and explores for other planets. The more he earned, the more he lost the conscience and became completely isolated and annihilated from the social life. He did every struggle to fulfill his desire but the more he achieved the worst he lives. Man served centuries in defining to create a mechanical device ""Computer"" that no one could ever think of. Today man has created computer and most other technological and advanced devices for his comfort, but the question is, ""Are we really rising?"" ""Are we really going ahead of the time?"" The emergence of modern technology has allowed humankind to live luxurious lives. Today, people indulge themselves with modern innovations, which did not exist in ancient world. The current age has coddled men with ecommerce, advanced communication, video conferences, digital libraries and many other advanced technologies. These inventions have prompted men to strive as much as possible. Due to todays modernism, the world is called ""a global village"". It is worthy to note that at the time of our forefathers, we did not have blood pressure, heart attack or HIV aids. Every disease was simple to cure. In the same way, people were living a simple life with honesty, hospitality, dignity and respect. They used to study under lamps, with quality and quantity. They worked mostly in agricultural field but lived a happier life and connected to each other at any point of time. We think that we have risen into a wonderful life of innovations and surpassed our forefathers in almost every aspects of life! The twenty first century seems to us a glorious age of modernity and we feel proud of ourselves on its achievements and ignore the ancient times accomplishments. Modern people think that they are much more civilized than their forefathers and that they were not civilized as of them. But the evidences clearly show the reverse. Their true wisdom and knowledge are todays main achievements and inventions. The archaeological excavations show that our forefathers were much civilized. The great pyramids of Egypt, the arena or the coliseum, palace buildings, etc. of Rome, great market places and the ports of Athens in Greece and many more that I cant take names, are the symbols of ancient civilizations that we cant see them unfortunately or bypass them in some ways. These achievements are the great examples of their civilizations to show how advanced they were in their particular time. Indeed, they were the true hero of their time and as well as ours. The richness of ancient civilization can be seen from the architectural beauty of Afghanistans Buddahs in Bamyan, one of the worlds most glorious master-pieces that attract all people, from every corner of the world. The Kunduz Hoard of silver coins, the Bagram Treasure, a collection of precious 2nd-century Roman Empire, the eclectic mix of high-quality works that passed along the Silk Route, the Bactrian Gold, excavated at Tilla-Tepe, which included over 20,000 items from the 1st century. The mix of Classical and oriental influence evident in the items forming the collection of Bactrian Gold demonstrates the creative fusion between cultures that has given the region its different character. These were built not only to worship the God but also for the sake of protecting their culture through arts for the knowledge of the future generations, for the sake of defensive activities during the times of wars and for storing grain seeds in the metal pots on the top of the Temples for regeneration of crops after droughts or great destructions. More importantly, our forefathers had a very proper lifestyle, which demonstrates how wise and knowledgeable they were on their time. For the individual, they had planned four comprehensive stages of life such as, survival, awareness and harmony. Thus, for the society they had developed four types of duties to be carried out in order to sustain their social justice for the sake of living a proper life, such as to provide guidance to the kings with wise advices was the responsibility of the philosophers, 2. To protect the nation was the responsibility of the kings, 3. To enhance the wealth of the nation was the duty of the merchants and 4. To serve under them was the duty of the craftsmen. They were living a very integrated life with harmony, brotherhood and unity. Their life was simple but wisely advanced in every field of life, particularly in the field of architecture, arts, science, astronomy, mathematics, medicines and many other means for their survival. Not to ignore the fact, our forefathers were not much affected by their civilization as of today. They didnt have problems as of now, such as extreme rate of unemployment, poverty, most dangerous diseases, economic backwardness, suicide-bombing and other inhuman acts of terrorism which are continuously hunting us and hitting us so hard. They were much civilized in their culture and did every effort to maintain and preserve their identity and culture that we are proud of today. But what so far we have done in response to their strife for our survival? Condemn and ignore their sacrifices for our survival and state that they were ignorant and couldnt do as of us. We destroyed their great achievements, such as great universities were demolished, wealth was plundered and temples were ruined to build up things of our own interest in the name of modern civilization or politics and religion. At their time, there were no borders and everyone was living a life free from boundaries, discrimination and annihilation. Their life was much more peaceful then now. They had a restful ways of life with honor, love and compassion. Now let us see closely what so far our modern civilization has given us? Human freedom, a life worst than animals, human rights, beheading of the mankind, advancements of new disastrous nuclear bombs, the inventions of new technologies for transportation, communication and other destructive means of life? Do you mean these are to be called modern civilization? We have lost our conscience and moral in the name of modern civilization and become mad for gaining more. We ignore our parents, brothers, sisters, relatives and every part of our blood to satisfy our evil desire. We cant feel the pain and our hearts have become stones. Man to acquire more, rushes like mad after something which is not clear, is behaving in a strange manner creating new psychological problems and unbecoming of a human being in the modern world. In fact, our so-called civilization is purely materialistic and hundred percent destructive. Spiritual values no longer govern the actions of people, in every walk of life. With the loss of spiritual faith, people have also lost their main supportive source of consolation in their distressing circumstances. There is an increasing dissatisfaction with each ones life. We do not know what to live for. Boredom with life and a feeling of ennui reflect our frame of mind. Thus a general restlessness prevails in our societies and rushes to bring further annihilations. To put into a nutshell, I would like to add that only the economic and the scientific developments of the modern world, good dressings will not make modern man civilized. In todays so-called modern world, the problems like population explosions, high rates of unemployment, Extreme poverty, killer diseases, threat of war, and pollution of environment have improved much more than the ancient time. For that reason, true civilization should be based on the sound state of our mind, human love and not on madness and hatred. This doesnt mean that I completely ignore todays generations creations. Indeed, that is appreciable and worth concerning. But these inventive and creative activities should be good, beautiful and excellent. The main point is, our inventions and creations should be useful and not harmful to mankind. They must protect the living creatures of all kinds. The earth is rich and there is room for everyone and we must protect it all together and that is the true meaning of modern civilization.",{},"['world', 'mans', 'today', 'todays', 'great', 'true', 'civilized', 'forefathers', 'face', 'evolution', 'life', 'civilization', 'living', 'modern', 'ignore']","Now let us see closely what so far our modern civilization has given us?

The earth is rich and there is room for everyone and we must protect it all together and that is the true meaning of modern civilization.",http://outlookafghanistan.net/topics.php?post_id=4261

Russia is the worlds largest per capita consumer of heroin and is coping with an epidemic of HIV/AIDS spread by dirty needles. Afghanistan has long been the worlds leading producer of opium, used to make heroin, and one-quarter of its production traverses its porous border with former Soviet states and supplies as many as 3 million Russian addicts. Viktor Ivanov, director of Russias Federal Service for the Control of Narcotics, in Chicago for meetings with his American counterparts, said he agreed with the dim assessment of U.S. poppy eradication efforts by some members of the U.S. Congress. ""Their words were that the efforts are unsatisfactory,"" Ivanov said through an interpreter in an interview with Reuters. He referred to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Charles Grassley, who co-chair a caucus on international drug trafficking. Russia has said the United States made a mistake in 2009 by phasing out crop eradication efforts to focus instead on intercepting drugs and hunting production labs and drug lords. President Barack Obama has committed to turning over security to Afghan control by the end of 2014. The United States launched the war weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks, targeting al Qaeda and the Taliban. Joint Russian-American anti-drug operations have appeared to tail off since a raid in October 2010 seized a ton of heroin and destroyed four drug-producing laboratories. There were four more joint raids conducted between December 2010 and February 2011, but Ivanov said it was cumbersome to obtain military approval quickly, given time-sensitive intelligence. IDEOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL In spite of concerns that the Taliban and other insurgent elements were financed by illegal drug profits, Ivanov said absentee landowners and traffickers who reap the bulk of the $7 billion in illegal drug proceeds did not have an ideological stake in the decade-old war. The Taliban earned $150 million annually from drug trafficking, he said. But the traffickers have hijacked the militarys transportation infrastructure in Afghanistan to help them ship their product, he said. The rising number of violent clashes in Afghanistan worked against any effort to persuade farmers to grow legal crops instead of opium poppies, Ivanov said. ""Ask any farmer if hes growing wheat and at the same time his country is torn by all sorts of military clashes. How safe will he feel about the future of his crops and the eventual sale of his crops?"" Ivanov said. ""Thats why we think the most efficient and effective measure is to destroy the product, the drug plantations and the drug laboratories,"" he said. The United Nations said land devoted to opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan rose 7 percent this year to 1,310 square kilometers (506 sq miles), much of it in the less-secure south and east. ""This tremendous amount of heroin is produced on a relatively small territory ... about the area of New York City,"" Ivanov said. He lobbied for creation of a digital poppy map that would identify poppy plantations and show where eradication was working, or not. The publicly accessible map would use surveillance data gathered by American drones and possibly a Russian-American satellite dedicated to the task. Ivanov said Russia, which fought its own costly war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, had also embarked on a concerted effort to treat its own addicts, which critics say it has often failed to do up to now. Scientists were working on a new pharmaceutical approach that would suppress the urge to use while not substituting one drug for another. Russian officials have rejected methadone, saying it is merely exchanges one addiction for another. U.S. addiction rates were also on the rise, Ivanov warned, with many users smoking or inhaling purer Afghan heroin.

"The Daily Outlook Afghanistan, print and online English Newspaper",Editorial: A dozen of children aged between six months and four years lost their lives as pneumonia surged in ...,,"December 30, 2012","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","A dozen of children aged between six months and four years lost their lives as pneumonia surged in the Shura village of Nusi district, northeastern province of Badakhshan, according to a report on Friday, December 28. The heavy snowfall has formerly gridlocked the many roads leading to the affected district, intervening with immediate dispatch of medical aid, fearing another 350 children at higher risk of dying. Afghanistan is one of the worst places in the world to be a child. The statistics are horrifying; one in four children dies before the age of five. There are manifold cases that undergo unreported on day to day basis. The tragedy is that it is easy to alter, but not enough is being done. Each year, pneumonia takes the life of two million children worldwide before they reach their fifth birthday. Pneumonia also identified as ""forgotten killer"" is an acute lower respiratory infection and inflammation of the lungs that can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Children with pneumonia may experience a number of symptoms, including rapid or difficult breathing, cough, fever, chill, loss of appetite and wheezing. Children with weakened immune systems are most at risk particularly for malnourished children and those who are not exclusively breastfed to six months. Symptomatic HIV infection and vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles increase a childs risk of infection. Crowded living situations and indoor air pollution caused by cooking and heating with wood or dung also contribute to susceptibility for pneumonia. The cold wet climate, together with smoke from household stoves, increases the risk of pneumonia, particularly among babies and children. Pneumonia is treated with low cost antibiotics and good case management assessment and treatment by a skilled health worker. The tragedy is that pneumonia can easily be treated, yet 80% of population in Afghanistan are living in remote under-served rural areas dont have access to quality health services and facilities with appropriate antibiotics. Typically it is the large number of poorest children in the poorest rural communities who are at greatest risk from dying of pneumonia. The governmental and non-governmental organizations should contribute raising awareness and allocate more funds to health-care sectors. Advocacy is proven and inexpensive community base methods to be used by government agencies to reach children in remoter and underserved areas might help to detect and treat the infection in time. Prior to life loses furthers, this communicable diseases should be combated by urgent allocation of money and resources.",{},"['reach', 'infection', 'underserved', 'children', 'pneumonia', 'rural', 'newspaper', 'print', 'tragedy', 'poorest', 'particularly', 'risk', 'english', 'outlook', 'afghanistan', 'daily', 'online']","Children with pneumonia may experience a number of symptoms, including rapid or difficult breathing, cough, fever, chill, loss of appetite and wheezing.

Sajida and Rashida were barely ...",,"July 12, 2011","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","In recent two e-mails I received from the parents of two teenage girls who were forcefully married to wealthy and powerful war criminals in Northern Afghanistan, they have painted heart-broken stories of their innocent daughters torture, humiliation and imprisonment by their ignorant husbands. Sajida and Rashida were barely 12 years old at the time of their marriage. The story, though interesting but ignominious. I am not going to comment it in detail as I have limited space here. The recent sale of two more Afghan girls in separate incidents in the hands of war criminals has sparked concern about the protection of young girls in Northern Afghanistan. Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission has received hundreds complaints about the sale of teenage girls in Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz, Jaozjan, Shiberghan, Baghlan, Samangan and Takhar provinces. In Takhar province, a nine year old girl was sold for just 240 dollars while in Baghlan, 11 years old girl was sold to a Tajik warlord for only 300 dollars. Sex trade and male prostitution has brought disgrace and shame to Afghanistan. Sex trade and male prostitution has taken deep roots in the country after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. The Persian word, Bacha-Bazi means ""boy play"" or ""boy for play."" As per its conservative nature, in Afghan society, women either prostitute or professional are not allowed to perform dance among the male parties, therefore, in all parties arranged by warlords and their cronies, play boys are lured to dance all the night. Warlords in Northern Afghanistan, according to press reports, recruit young boys for sex and dance, while local authorities remain powerless in stopping the practice. Bacha-Bereesh of ages 15 to 20 are normally dressed in women cloths, dancing all the night then abused by several men. The issue is very complicated. According to press reports, more than one hundred thousands Afghan men and women are suffering from HIV and Aids. Local warlords in Northern Afghanistan dont even know about the fatal consequences of prostitution and sex trafficking business. There is huge increase in the number of sex workers in the country. US Department of State report (2007) has placed Afghanistan as a source, transit, for women, and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In Afghanistan, local and foreigner women serve both Afghans and foreigners in guesthouses and brothels. Under the Afghan law, sex trade and prostitution is often considered adultery, which is punishable by five to 15 years in prison. Recent investigative reports have revealed some facts and figures about the play boy hobbies in Pashtun majority provinces. Pashtun transport mafia is deeply involved with the business and every two in ten Pashtun truck drivers are involved in male prostitution. In Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, Zabul, Kandahar, Khost,Quetta, Bannu and Waziristan male prostitution is not considered an illegal custom. Every young and old man, if they want can have a boy. Recently I was told by one of my Afghan friends in London that some Afghan male prostitutes have claimed asylum in the UK due to the fear of their persecution in returning to Afghanistan. They are sexually abused, and they are even bought and sold. Fights take place over these Bacha-Bbereesh. Its increasing day by day, and its catastrophic. To dress up their actions, the men involved in sex trade often insist these boys are to be dressed up in womens clothing and dancing in front of groups of paying men. Man-boy homosexuality has flourished anew in the aftermath of Taliban zero-tolerance laws, albeit a selectively punished offence in that era. Afghan boys are mostly turn to sex work and a life on the streets because they were fleeing something worse at home. In the past, Brothels were openly allowed in the street of Kabul and they openly enjoyed this business. Islam doesnt allow such a practice and count it as one of the most sinful acts. Afghan Ulema are of the opinion that making boys dance and sexually abuse is not allowed in Islam. Afghan police officers are deeply involved in male prostitution while Interior Ministry in Kabul has recently received thousands complaints from locals regarding the police sexual attacks on young boys. An intelligence website, Wikileaks recently released a cable from Afghanistan revealing U.S. government contractor DynCorp involvement in playboy business. DynCorp is a company of private militia training Afghan police force. According to recent reports, more than ninety five percent budget of the militia comes from the US and part of that is being spent on child abuse parties and sex trafficking in Northern Afghanistan. To meet the sexual needs of the Afghan police officers, in December 2010, as WikiLeaks Cable reported DynCorp purchased young boys for Afghan policemen. The boys were to be used in Bacha-Bazi. DynCorp members and officers have already been engaged in sex with 12 to 15 year old children, and sold them to each other as slaves in Bosnia. After the WikiLeaks revelations about the DynCorp involvement in sex trade in Northern Afghanistan, Afghan Interior Ministry carried out a thorough investigation against the private militia company. The investigation resulted in the arrest of two Afghan police and nine other Afghans for the crime of ""purchasing a service from a child.""The US State Department began its own investigation whether DynCorp had ignored signs of drug abuse among employees in Afghanistan or not, but Inspector General of the State Department in its report concluded that dancing boy incident is no criminal activity in Afghanistan. This shameless practice has also prompted Defense Department of the United States to hire a social scientist, Anna Maria to investigate the problem, as several US soldiers on patrol often passed older men walking hand-in-hand with pretty young boys. There are thousands young boys undergone ordeals. But actual numbers of these vulnerable boys are not known.",{},"['women', 'prostitution', 'bachabazi', 'sex', 'dyncorp', 'afghan', 'boys', 'northern', 'young', 'male', 'afghanistan', 'child']","Sex trade and male prostitution has brought disgrace and shame to Afghanistan.

Afghan women continue to be victim of domestic and sexual violence by warlords, war criminals and private militia commanders. During the last three months, I have been receiving e-mails from some helpless Afghan women about their heart breaking stories of forced marriages. In their e-mails letters, they complain that rape is not considered as a serious crime in the country, if a woman reports a rape case to the police investigation began about her character. One of the e-mails I received last week from Takhar province describes the story of two small girls and a woman raped by armed men on June 15, 2011. A six-year old girl was also among the victims. However, twenty days ago, a 15-year-old girl was gang-raped by five armed men in Kalifgan district. Afghan Human rights official says that last year; more than 2,765 cases of violence against women and girls were reported to the rights watchdog while Fawzia Amini, of the Afghan Ministry of Womens Affairs revealed that some 6,765 cases of violence against women and girls were registered in 2010. The three decades long civil war, foreign interventions, poverty, unemployment, militarization, ignorance, knife and gun culture and political rivalries are factors making the women and children of Afghanistan vulnerable to trafficking, prostitution and playboy business. Afghanistan shares borders with Iran, Pakistan, China and Central Asian States and offers an environment for facilitating the business of women, children and drug trafficking. Majority of Afghan children, women and girls trafficked in and outside the country are being sold in the local prostitution markets or in the hands of wealthy individuals, warlords and private militia commanders. UNICEF in its report revealed that fifty seven percent of Afghan marriages involve girls under sixteen. Insecurity, fear of kidnapping and rape has also prompted many families to force their young daughters into marriage. In Northern Afghanistan, and in parts of Southern provinces, the same story is repeated. In various districts of Northern provinces, poor and poverty stricken girls and children are being kidnapped and sold into prostitution. Unemployed and poor young boys have also been subjected to trafficking for male prostitution, forced labor and playboy business. The traditions of child marriage have long been practiced in Afghanistan. Afghanistans civil war left hundreds of thousands women widow and young children orphaned. As matrimonial life is much expensive across the country, specifically, in Paktika and Paktia provinces, the price for a young girl has been fixed more than three millions in Afghan currency. Education for girls in these provinces is considered to be a great sin while sports and other hobbies are not allowed. Majority of Afghan girls became pregnant before they reach physical maturity because they dont know about the family law of the country. The Afghan Civil Law sets the minimum age for marriage at sixteen for girls and at eighteen for boys. A heart-breaking story of an Afghan girl who was sold again and again in the hands of criminal mafia groups is indicative of the increasing violence against women. A young girl of poor parents, Benazir was twelve years old when she was forcefully married to an illiterate man. She remained with him for nine years and had four children. After nine years, her husband sold her to a human trafficker. He kept her for a month, and sold to another man, two month later she was sold to a fourth man and after a year she was resold to a criminal. What happened to Benazir, nobody knows but Benazir is not the only victim of war criminals in her country, there are thousands of women and girls in Afghanistan whose lives are in danger. Cases of rape are in thousands, torture and domestic violence in Northern Afghanistan is being encouraged by mafia groups. Recently, in Balkh Province, a teenage girl was kidnapped, tortured and raped by a warlord. This was a great shame for her family. Her parent decided to kill her but a local NGO saved her life. Brothels in Mazar-e-Sharif, Balkh, Laghman, Samangan and Kunduz provinces openly campaign for young girls. As they have strong support from the war criminal partners and corrupt officials in the police department, they freely run their businesses. Neither have they taught people about HIV virus nor about AIDs. Consequently, over one hundred thousand people are suffering from HIV virus in Afghanistan. Another profitable business which has attracted thousand of criminal elements and warlords is playing with boys or ""having sex with boys"". This is an old and ugly tradition of Afghanistan. Orphan and poor children are picked from the streets or purchased from their parents who agree to sell them to those wealthy males who are fond of homosexuality. The parents are normally agreed on a ""good price"" for their child. It seems neither illegal nor the police show any interest to intercept it. In Kandahar, and parts of Northern Afghanistan, Afghan married and unmarried men love boys roughly 15 to 20 years old. The price of a young and beautiful boy has been fixed up to 100,000 Afghanis. ""Keeping a beautiful boy has become a custom in Kandahar now,"" a Kandahari homosexual once told me. When we study the poetry books in Kandahar or in any province in the North, we come across many poems about homosexuality. Male prostitution has not been considered a harmful business in Afghanistan since decades. Though, keeping a playboy or Bacha Berish (a boy without beard) is not illegal but thousands wealthy people, businessmen and criminal gangs are involved with playboys across the country since long. After the US invasion in 2001, sex trafficking in the country becomes a profitable business. One of my police friends recently told me that more than 3000 families in Jawzjan, Mazar, Kunduz, Herat, Samangan and Faryab provinces have been involved in prostitution since last ten years. The main factor behind this business he told me is poverty and unemployment.",{},"['boy', 'women', 'marriages', 'prostitution', 'children', 'forced', 'business', 'play', 'provinces', 'afghan', 'sold', 'country', 'young', 'girls', 'afghanistan']","Afghan women continue to be victim of domestic and sexual violence by warlords, war criminals and private militia commanders.

At times, it  ...",,"December 08, 2013","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","With the announcement of the sad demise of Nelson Mandela, world recalled the great lessons given by him. He spent more than 25 years in prison but he never lost his faith on his cause. At times, it looked as if it will all end without any result because he was getting old and the scenario did not appear to have changed a lot but he never gave up. He gave the lesson of complete devotion and dedication to the world. He was a true picture of the saying that, ‘suffering breeds character. Character breeds faith and in the end, faith will not disappoint.’ Even after so many sufferings, he decided to forget those who did all these and did not even think of avenging. It was also necessary as he had to keep the nation united and did not reverse the flow of emotions from blacks to the whites. It was the reason why, no violence erupted when transition of power came and centuries’ old system was smoothly and peacefully replaced. When he was elected the first black president of South Africa, he left an example of following the path of democracy by quitting his post after his first term and gave chance to others to take the lead of the country. It is very rare in African continent and to some extent, in other parts of the world that leaders hardly show willingness to leave the power and promote the healthy democratic practices in this regard. Then he turned his attention towards those humanitarian and welfare which the poor and calamity-hit people of this country badly needed. He started work on different projects like controlling HIV Aids, and providing the basic education to the children of the backward areas of the country. When we look at his life, the years of suffering and difficulties are more than that of the success but he had a firm belief in himself and his cause; to make South Africa a country where people would avail all the rights without any discrimination. This noble cause always kept his spirits high and he never gave up; however hard the conditions maybe. once he had to resort for a limited armed struggle as well because he was left with no other option and he was criticized by the West as well but now they realize that they were wrong and Mandela was correct as it was a temporary phase in his struggle and later on he showed that he was the true believer of peace and dialogue. Nelson Mandela was born in a land where a minority of white people had deprived a vast minority of black people from their rights in their own land. Majority of blacks lived in villages or rural areas where the light of education had never reached and enlightened their minds. They were never a danger for the ruling group as they could have never realized their condition and demanded any kind of right. Very small minority of the blacks was residing in urban settlements and cities but then there were present many restrictions on them. Special passes were issued for them, and anyone who wanted to travel to any other part of the country had to take prior permission from the court, and was badly punished if found without his pass. Blacks had no right to vote and elect the representatives of their own and they were lead by the chiefs who were mainly the elected representatives of the central government. These chiefs kept their status and position dear to anything else and thus they were the biggest barriers in the way of progress of their own fellow citizens. Blacks had no right of property and time and again, the central government passed laws that gave the rights to whites to snatch and dislocate the blacks from their lands and towns. Similarly, blacks had no share in government offices, or other prestigious or important posts. They could hardly become an office clerk or a schoolteacher but they were never let to make access to important posts. Similarly, they had almost no share in the business of the country and they worked on meager wages in mines administered and owned by their white masters. But most painful was that, they had no social status or respect. They were treated as second-class citizens in their own land. In such suffocating circumstances, some Africans had started dreaming of a free land. Almost all the Africans who could see and feel this situation were in pain and there was a fire burning in their hearts and heads but they could do nothing as they were facing an enemy very strong and cunning. Every way was blocked for them and they were left with every limited choice. Nelson Mandela joined African National Congress (ANC) that was working for the freedom of blacks. Like any other great leader, he suffered a lot right from the beginning. He opened the black law firm in Johannesburg that aimed at the service of oppressed black people. He was an active member of his party and always believed in peaceful struggle but their efforts did not bring out any result as government strictly and harshly crushed their struggle. Then he co-founded and led the armed wing of African National Congress (ANC) but they always tried not to harm the public and not violate the human rights. Right from the beginning, he was repeatedly banned or imprisoned. His passes were banned and many a times, he was expelled from different cities. In 1964, he was sentenced for a lifetime imprisonment and was sent to prison in Robben Island where he spent eighteen years of 27 years long imprisonment. Due to the international pressure, Mandela was released in 1990. As a result of first multi-racial elections of 1994, ANC won 62% votes and Nelson Mandela was elected as the first black president of the country. In 1999, after the completion of his term, he decided not to stand for the second term and retired himself for the welfare work, in and outside his country. Few things include him among the greatest leaders of the world. He emerged from a very poor background (his father’s friend brought him up when he was left as an orphan at the age of 9). He never got disappointed with the adverse conditions. Many times, he was left all alone and difficulties had ceased his way completely but this could only make him slow down for a while and then start his efforts with a renewed energy and spirit. Had there been anyone else in his place, he could have easily given up but he was a person who was alien to the concepts of disappointment and retreat. Secondly, he was always in favor of education. He continued his disrupted education in the prison and completed his Bachelor of Law from the University of London via correspondence. Later on, he introduced many reforms to promote education in the country. During his presidency and the terms followed by his successors, the expenditure on education substantially increased. Compulsory education was introduced for African children between ages of six to fourteen and 3.5 to 5 million schoolchildren were provided with free meals. In different regions of the world, the spirit of leaders and members of a nation exist until the freedom is achieved and mostly the leaders are found to be having no concrete plans after the freedom. This was not the case with Nelson Mandela. After he became president and in the terms followed by his fellows, many laws were introduced that were aimed to bring social equality, justice and reforms to decrease the gap between the rich and poor. He and his followers introduced a number of successful reforms to decrease poverty and make the condition of public stable. He was not a person who wanted to enjoy the power so when he saw that a democratic system of government was able to run the country successfully; he decided not to stand for the second term of presidency when he could have easily become the president. People are busy in praising this great man of change and equality but his teachings would only be effective if we all try to understand and adopt them.",{},"['world', 'left', 'great', 'blacks', 'education', 'gave', 'black', 'mandela', 'right', 'die', 'country', 'term']","With the announcement of the sad demise of Nelson Mandela, world recalled the great lessons given by him.

"The Daily Outlook Afghanistan, Kabul based English Newspaper.","Daily Outlook Afghanistan covers national, regional and international developments with daily editorials and articles on important issues.",,,,"Home » About us About Us The launch of the new Outlook Afghanistan internet-based news service is an important step for the Afghanistan Group of Newspapers. We also believe that it is significant in the progress of our country. Our Group is proud to be part of the process of developing a democratic Afghanistan. After three decades of conflict and power struggles, only freedom of expression offers the people of Afghanistan a sense of having a stake in governing this country. Every day of the week we in the Afghanistan Group work to consolidate this hard-won freedom and build the popular foundation of Afghan democracy. Our approach in the Afghanistan Group is informed by experience of the role of media in development internationally and in the history of our country. The hallmark of our publications is that they are independent, professional, informed by a national vision and globally connected. People living in established democracies take it for granted that the media serve as the fourth pillar of state. Protection of freedom of expression is fundamental to the constitution of countries like the United States. There the media hold democratic politicians accountable. They inform citizens and politicians alike and thrive on political debate, whether at local or national level. Any professional journalist has studied the famous cases in which the printed word has been the downfall of rulers who had become contemptuous of their people and their laws. Afghans have experienced every form of tyranny and take none of these freedoms for granted. As we make our difficult transitions, struggling for security and political stability, Afghanistan needs vibrant media more than ever before. But in its history of 130 years, the print media in the country mostly remained under firm government control. Successive narrowly based regimes used media as a mouthpiece, offering citizenry a distorted, propagandist view of reality. The Taliban regime for its part strangled the media, destroying infrastructure, burning archives, banning photography and stopping woman journalists from working. Afghans will not tolerate a return to those days and nurturing independent media is fundamental to the struggle for peace. Superficially there has been rapid progress, with hundreds of newspapers, periodicals and magazines born since 2001. But most of them are amateurish, run on a shoestring and lack the capacity to engage in real news-gathering. Even more worryingly, many of the new media organs are owned by power brokers and government figures, and so are tied to the new governing elites. Our groups flagship publication is the Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the countrys pioneering English language publication. After a period of consultation, we launched it to fill an important niche in the market. On the one hand a new generation of Afghans has a global perspective and is comfortable inter-acting with the world through English. Young men and women in Kabul University and the provinces and Afghans in international organizations and business are empowered by their use of English. Meanwhile, foreigners working in Afghanistan need access to up to date information on public affairs, reconstruction and security but do not necessarily trust the government version as the last word on anything important. The Daily Outlook aims to be the daily newspaper on the desk of all those who want to read on Afghanistan in English. The newspaper covers national, regional and international developments with daily editorials and articles on important issues. On Sundays, the paper publishes an additional «Weekend Special» covering political, health, science, politics, culture, cross-cutting issues like gender, HIV/AIDS, environment, youth affairs, sports and showbiz. We have received appreciation from friends in the United Nations, diplomatic missions, educational institutions, civil society and even government. We are delighted that our pages offer a show case for Afghan democratic opinion. Astute observers of the Afghan scene, trying to keep up with the public debate, look first to the Daily Outlook. Our paper has offered some of the hardest hitting coverage of corruption, electoral fraud, security blunders, regional diplomacy and the realities of governance. The Afghanistan Group also publishes in Pashto and Dari. It launched ""the Daily Afghanistan"" on September 06, 2006. This paper has built on the Daily Outlooks reputation for professionalism and has achieved distinction with the biggest circulation of any daily newspaper in the country. We are proud to have won the trust of readers in both English and the national languages. Not only do our publications provide the best news coverage available to an Afghan readership, we have developed a truly national distribution network, to ensure access for readers across the country. Our network distributes across Kabul and the provinces of Afghanistan. Our bureau offices operate in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, in the eastern city of Jalalabad and in historic Ghazni. We are continuously working to expand our news-gathering and distribution networks throughout Afghanistan.

Maltreating Women – An Unending Issue,"Editorial: A report has released that a teenage girl was found dead  after being kidnapped in Nahor District of Ghazni province. Her parents said  that the girl, who was engaged, received threats  ...",,"January 12, 2015","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","A report has released that a teenage girl was found dead after being kidnapped in Nahor District of Ghazni province. Her parents said that the girl, who was engaged, received threats from three men who live in their village alleging that the intimidators were involved in the crime. Her old mother, who had turned obsessive after her daughter’s death, urged the judiciary board to take a serious action in this regard and do not free the murderers with impunity. Nahor is a remote village in Ghazni district, where women work hard from dawn to dusk twenty-four/seven. Women and men work side by side on the farms. Additionally, women babysit while working on the farms and grin and bear it. Moreover, violence against women takes place every now and then. As a result, it is remembered vividly when a man shot his wife dead a few years ago and also killed his cousin claiming to be in contact with his wife – the claim which remained unsupported by documents. Violence and violation of rights weighs heavily on women. As long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance. As long as outmoded ways of thinking prevent women from making a meaningful contribution to society, progress will be slow. As long as the nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself, it is doomed to failure. The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially has an impact on their lives that they are impeded to exercise their human rights, for instance, the fear for contribution to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. On 13 November 2014 – The United Nations Special Rapporteur on violence against women, Rashida Manjoo, has called on the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to address the causes and consequences of gender-based violence in the country. Wrapping up a nine-day official visit to the country, Ms. Manjoo warned in a statement that violence against women in Afghanistan continues to be a source of deep concern, despite positive legislative and institutional developments brought forward amid a situation of insecurity throughout the country. “Accountability for all crimes committed against women and girls, the empowerment of women, and the transformation of society, need to remain a focus for the Government of Afghanistan, independent State institutions, civil society organizations and also the international community,” she stressed. Moreover, Manjoo noted with concern that many women and girls continue to lack access to the formal justice system. Her investigation also found problems with corruption within the justice system as well as distrust concerning the ability of the courts to appropriately adjudicate matters related to women’s rights. These factors combine with societal pressure to push women and girls outside of the formal justice system to resolve disputes. Afghan women and girls are reluctant to report crimes of violence. Manjoo reported several reasons, including “lack of knowledge of the law and its protective remedial provisions; fear of reprisal from the perpetrators and family members; financial and other constraints, including the lack of freedom of movement; and fear of being treated as criminals instead of victims, when reporting crimes committed against them.” Elzira Sagynbaeva, the representative of UN Women in Afghanistan, said violence against women and girls remains endemic. ""It constitutes a serious violation of human rights impeding women’s full realization of their civil, political, social, cultural and economic and development rights,"" she said in a statement on November 25. Despite the situation of insecurity throughout the country, it is clear that there have been legislative and institutional developments. This is a reflection of political will in addressing the promotion and protection of women’s rights which is further reflected in the appointments of women in high level positions. However, such developments should not detract from the fact that violence against women continues to be a source of deep concern in Afghanistan. Currently, there is no comprehensive and coherent data collection mechanism to enable either government or the public at large to fully grasp the magnitude of the phenomenon in the country. Despite government agencies and civil society organizations collecting statistics, these estimates are disputed, depending on whom one speaks to or receives information from. The lack of effective interpretation and implementation of laws and policies requires attention by the government of Afghanistan, as does the issue of the allocation of appropriate resources to enable sustainable solutions. It is rightly said, “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.” The National Unity Government has to end the political and social challenges of the Afghan people. Insecurity and sufferings are disheartening our people with each passing day. Yet, the government has turned a blind eye to the social problems. Hope the new government breaks the deadlock and put their electoral agenda in practice as soon as possible and prioritize the elimination of violence against women.",{},"['society', 'women', 'manjoo', 'rights', 'maltreating', 'lack', 'issue', 'womens', 'afghanistan', 'unending', 'woman', 'girls', 'violence']","As long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance.

Anti-Narcotics War,"Opinion: In official Government press releases, they claim opium cultivation is the main source of income for farmers in the province; therefore it needs long-term strategy to reduce  ...",,"September 04, 2012","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","In official Government press releases, they claim opium cultivation is the main source of income for farmers in the province; therefore it needs long-term strategy to reduce production. Millions of dollars have been spent in alternative crop supporting programs. But recent history tells us a different story. For instance, farmers in Helmand, a.k.a Opiumistan, did not grow poppy in 70s and 80s, and under the last years of Taliban rule. If these peasants could make a livelihood through other crops, why they are unable to do so today, despite the attractive supporting-packages they are being offered in mega-million alternative-crop programs? The US, Britain and Denmark financed $13 million for the eradication campaign last year. More than 42,000 farmers in Helmand were enlisted to receive subsidized wheat and fertilizer. The peasants paid only a quarter of the market price for the supply they were provided under this subsidy program. According to latest media reports, there is a dangerous trend of new rise in the use of drugs in Afghanistan. According to a report from Herat, an increasing number of drug users are female. Statistics show that annually there are more than 150 new addicts. Among them, there are also pregnant women, who transfer this deadly-addiction to their newborns. It is more dangerous, because children of a female addict also become addicts. In the kingdom of Opiumistan, Governor Mengal is credited for the support-package dubbed as ""food zone program"". For the last two years, we have seen their failure to bring a big difference. The question is, how long will the international community continue financing the campaign, and the Anti-Narcotics Ministry keep bribing the farmers to stop poppy cultivation? The Government has been very soft in the opium war. There are certain reasons behind this. The answer to this question is clear. The drug business is not that simple. There is a big mafia that controls the supply and cultivation, with support from bigwigs in the corridors of power. The official argument and statistics is that 60% to 70% of the farmers in Helmand depend on poppy production, and if there is an eradication campaign of destroying the crops, it will ""push"" the peasants to insurgency. With this logic, the poorest of Afghanistan in Badakhshan and Daikundi should have been the Opiumistan, or centers of insurgency. It is not a reduction-campaign, but a bribery-package to the so-called farmers. The myth that majority of farmers grow poppy because of extreme poverty is partly a propaganda and disinformation campaign by drug-lords and those who are in this business. The Government has no efficient program for drug addicts. There is only one hospital of 150-bed for over 70,000 drug addicts in Herat. There must be strict checking and rehabilitation centers in Herat for all the returnees. The mounting number of drug addicts across the country is just one of the problems that come with Afghan refugees, besides the spread of HIV AIDS, prostitution and social problems. With easy availability of all kinds of drugs in cheap prices, it is spreading fast in other parts of the country. Our economy depends heavily on drug trade. While talking at an international conference recently, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged countries involved in Afghanistan to step up the fight to combat poppy cultivation and drug business. He said there cannot be sustainable development when opium production is the only viable economic activity in Afghanistan, and added that there cannot be stability when 15 percent of our gross domestic product comes from drug trade. The UN Secretary General said Afghanistans drug economy is worth $2.4 billion. He emphasized that the Afghan Government must prioritize the issue of narcotics. Law enforcement agencies must work harder on eradication crops, eliminating laboratories, keeping precursors from entering the country. According to a UN report released last year, poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has increased significantly. The report said there has been an increase of seven percent in the year 2011 compared to the year before that. The increase was reported despite the fact that Ministry of Antinarcotics had claimed to have destroyed 65 percent of the total cultivation that year. The US and its NATO allies caught up in the prioritize of an exit strategy, are largely ignoring the focus on poppy eradication, and our Government with some bigwigs of the power corridor involved in drug profits have always been opposing effective and harsh programs of eradication. The Government and international forces should enforce the poppy eradication campaign. The war on poppy is forgotten. Aside from the fact that a huge part of the financial support to insurgents comes from transport and smuggling of opium, its also exporting deaths to millions of people around the world, and the number of drug addicts increasing in Afghanistan. Taliban militants get $400 million a year through direct and indirect revenue from poppy cultivation, transportation and trade.",{},"['antinarcotics', 'cultivation', 'drug', 'opium', 'farmers', 'addicts', 'eradication', 'campaign', 'poppy', 'afghanistan', 'war', 'report']","The US, Britain and Denmark financed $13 million for the eradication campaign last year.

The 7 billionth person will be born into a world that is very different from when the United Nations was founded in 1945, when our numbers were only about a third of what they are today. We are living 30 per cent longer. More of our children survive. We are now more urban. We are more interconnected and interdependent than ever. The 7 billionth person will also be born into a world of contradictions. While most people are having smaller families, our numbers grow globally. While some poor countries populations are growing more quickly than their economies, the populations of some rich countries are shrinking, threatening to undermine economic growth. There are more young people in the world, but there are also more elderly. The population of Afghanistan is very young with only 30% of the population being 25 years or older and is growing at a rate that will double its present size in less than thirty years if the present levels of fertility are maintained. The challenges ahead are formidable, with new pressures on land, energy, food and infrastructure and on the governments that must provide services, such as education and health, and with the global economic crisis shaking the foundations of individuals, families and communities. We can—and must—confront these challenges. But we must act now. What we do today can have a profound impact on the lives of people everywhere tomorrow and for generations to come. We have to protect our environment, provide clean water and energy and enough food, and address the threat of climate change. We have to rectify inequalities between women and men, girls and boys. We must change attitudes so that violence or discrimination against women and girls becomes unacceptable everywhere. We must ensure girls have the same educational opportunities as boys. We must continue work against skewed sex ratios. We also need to make motherhood safe. That means caring for pregnant women, preventing deaths in childbirth, and providing nutrition to mothers and babies. Millions of mothers must still give birth without help from a skilled birth attendant. And millions more have little or no say in basic decisions about how many children they have or when to have them. An estimated 215 million women in the developing world lack access to modern family planning. We have seen the impressive difference that midwives can make in their communities and we are pleased to see that the Ministry of Public Health in Afghanistan developed and approved the first country specific policy and strategy for Nursing and Midwifery Services. This is an important step in Afghanistans impressive efforts to increase the percentage of births attended by skilled birth attendants. About a quarter of the worlds people are between the ages of 10 and 24. We used to say our youth will be the leaders of the future—but, as we have seen in many parts of the world, we now know that they are already leaders of today. Young people have the potential to transform economies, politics, and whole societies. They have the potential to drive development through their creativity, ideas, enthusiasm, and innovative spirit. However, in order for this potential to be realized, governments, UNFPA and the wider United Nations should take steps to ensure our youth populations are healthy and have access to education, including sexuality education, so they may understand how to protect themselves from HIV and have the knowledge to make informed decisions. Girls who stay in school are less likely to have unintended pregnancies, are healthier, and more economically productive in adulthood. We must ensure that our youth have jobs and opportunities for sustainable livelihoods. Today, only about half of the worlds youth participate in the labour force, and almost everywhere, young women have fewer job opportunities than men do. Investments in young peoples education, health and employment can enable countries to build a strong economic base and reduce poverty, a key aim of the Millennium Development Goals. In Afghanistan people less than 25 years old make up almost 70 percent of the total population. By investing in their health and education Afghanistan will be in a better position to generate the kind of returns that will enable strong economic growth and social development for generations to come. Lifting people out of poverty, maintaining a healthy planet, promoting economic growth and development, and tearing down barriers to equality are one and the same fight. Development can only be sustainable when it is equitable and serves all people. By investing in people now—empowering them to make choices that are good for themselves and the global commons–our world of 7 billion can have thriving sustainable cities, productive labour forces that can fuel economic growth and youth populations that can fully contribute to their communities and nations. Our world of 7 billion presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities.

Moscow Hopes its Afghan Rebuild to Usher in Stability,"News: KABUL - Russia hopes to embark on a series of ambitious construction projects in Afghanistan aimed at reinforcing fragile stability in the country where Soviet troops fought a disastrous, decade-long war, its envoy to Kabul said Thursday.<br>

Though not connected by land, Moscow sees war-ravaged Afghanistan as a neighbor and is concerned by what it describes as the two-pronged threat of drugs and terrorism which reach Russia through ex-Soviet Central Asian countries. Andrey Avetisyan said Russia had limited involvement in Afghan reconstruction over the last decade ""because it was all about fighting, and since we are not fighting, we didnt see much place for our activity."" But that approach has changed. ""Now, were trying to kind of start anew,"" he told Reuters in the glistening rebuilt embassy, a third of its Soviet size during the war, whose end 23 years ago Wednesday was marked by Afghans and Russians. Russia hopes to begin with reconstructing around 150 Soviet-era projects, from Afghanistans most important stretch of highway, the congested and aging Salang tunnel, to a Kabul bread factory that once fed the entire Afghan security forces. For these, many of which were built by Soviets before they invaded in 1979, the same technology, documentation and even the same engineers still exist, meaning the Russians are in prime position to take over the work, Avetisyan said. Moscow then aims to delve into new ventures, involving oil extraction, hydroelectric projects, housing and possibly even build the countrys first railway network. The Asian Development Bank a year ago estimated Afghanistans infrastructure requirements at more than $4 billion. Avetisyan declined to put a price tag on the Russian projects, but said a meeting in two weeks in Moscow, with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal, should shed more light on the exact proposals and what will be agreed upon. Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom, oil major Rosneft, state railway firm Russian Railways, second-biggest oil producer LUKOIL and state power holding company Inter RAO, as well as others, were interested in concrete projects in Afghanistan, he said. ""Were not going to tell the Afghans how to live, which life to live -- we stopped doing this 25 years ago,"" said Avetisyan, who worked for the Soviet government in Kabul, becoming fluent in Afghanistans two main languages, Dari and Pashto. ""We just want to have a friendly, independent Afghanistan as our neighbor... Economic development should go first, because there cannot be security without (this). The roots of insecurity are in the problems for people to find jobs, have a home."" ""PAST TEN YEARS ALMOST WASTED"" Escalating violence across Afghanistan in the 11th year of an increasingly unpopular war has sent tremors of worry across Russia, which borders mainly Muslim former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and which is battling a growing Islamist insurgency in its own volatile North Caucasus. The flow of Afghan heroin, branded a threat to national security by the Kremlin, has also set off alarm bells in a country which health officials warn is the worlds top user of heroin, spurring a crippling HIV/AIDS epidemic. Underscoring those fears is the looming deadline of end-2014 for NATO to train a 350,000-strong force of Afghan police and soldiers who will take over all security responsibilities from foreign combat troops, who will also leave by that time. Avetisyan said Washington was at risk of repeating the errant ways of its Cold War foe in approaching Afghanistan. ""They (the U.S.) came 10 years ago, thought they could fix it very quickly, and then leave. Exactly the same mistake that the Soviet army made,"" he said of its dispirited 1989 exit from a war that took 15,000 Soviet lives. After the Soviets rushed out, the Afghan communist government collapsed, leading to infighting between warlords and a vicious civil war that reduced much of Kabul to rubble and paved the way for the Talibans rise to power in 1996. Avetisyan lamented the slow economic development over the last decade, echoing the discontent of many ordinary Afghans who accuse the U.S. force in their country of not building enough. ""The past ten years were almost wasted in this sense,"" he said. ""... Why have the Americans achieved so little in terms of economic development? Because it is not in their plans and it still is not, I am afraid.""

Democracy Enshrines Equality of Opportunity!,"Opinion: the ultimate goal of  democracy is to preserve and promote the dignity and fundamental rights of the  individual, to achieve social justice, foster the economic and social  development of ...",,"June 10, 2015","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","the ultimate goal of democracy is to preserve and promote the dignity and fundamental rights of the individual, to achieve social justice, foster the economic and social development of the community, strengthen the cohesion of society and build a favorable environment for international peace. Democracy, development and human rights are therefore interdependent. The government has been poor enough to ensure all such provisions of democratic system. Afghanistan has been ravaged by years of conflict. Subsequent to Taliban’s regime toppled, Afghanistan was put on the way to democracy, the established and wide practiced system of government. Afghan national institutions are severely factional and lack a cohesive national security culture. In other words, Afghan institutions are not sufficiently focused on defending their own national interests. Influential figures continue to promote patronage networks further institutionalizing favoritism and corruption. The Afghan government continues to give free rein to well-known warlords and human rights abusers as well as corrupt politicians and businesspeople, further eroding public support. Reconstruction of the economic and political institutions through better administrative reforms is perhaps the most important means to ensuring long-term success of a state. The September 11 tragic incidence turned a blessing in disguise for Afghanis that brought Taliban’s repressive and despotic rule to an end. Subsequently, the modes of government altered but not the fate of people. The installment of democracy devoid of its fundamental requisites left the people suffer at the hand of non-conforming elements, insurgents and terrorists who at present seems to have grown mightier than previous. The centralized government brought forth, is perceived as continuation of denied political rights. The completion of two democratic terms and slight betterment in women rights and a small degree of freedom, of course, count the successes of the democratic government. The most crucial aspect that left undermined or ignored must be given prime importance in order to ensure vibrant democracy, as underlined below. It ascertains, people’s participation to play an active role in political and civic life. One expresses his will through regular free and fair elections. Voting in a democracy must be universal, equal and secret so that each of us can choose our representatives freely which is not witnessed in Afghanistan till date. Education and vibrant communications media are vital to be able to make an informed choice. Literacy rate touches the ground and media is highly restraint. The role citizens end after they cast their ballots; they aren’t continually engaged in public affairs so that thus kept ignorant of their right and duties. The Afghan population currently has few means of expressing dissent regarding policies carried out by the international community and the central government, which operates on a highly centralized patronage model in which power and resources are channeled through personal and political allies. The system lacks the connection, rules, and checks and balances necessary to make leaders truly accountable to the domestic population, which invites corruption, rent-seeking, and a hemorrhaging of domestic legitimacy. Local governmental bodies are the appropriate places for representing Afghans and responding to their needs, but these currently suffer from a lack of capacity, confusion over their roles and authorities, and little legitimacy. Incorporating the promotion of equality and dignity through the system of equal value for the vote of all individuals regardless of their sex, religion, language, economic or social status in democracy ensures political justice which is the foundation of social and economic justice, dignity of the individual and national cohesion. Without a well-functioning government apparatus, administrative system and an efficient and productive economy, no state will be able to maintain basic state functions. The objective is to strengthen planning and auditing activities, promote quality assurance, implement public welfare policies, organize management of human resources, maintain ongoing efforts to reform the administration and fight against corruption, and lay the foundations for managing finances and procurement. These broad based objectives can be met by inventing an efficient administrative system that could relief Afghanistan out of lingering administrative problems. In that pursuit a democratic institution must be built on structures and processes that are accountable, transparent, decentralized, and able to manage legitimate elections and the administration of justice, and operate under the oversight of the parliament. Furthermore, it should combat exclusion, protect public goods, actively engage civil society and the private sector, promote participation, and strengthen partnerships among sectors, groups, and every levels of government. Revitalizing public administration for people-centered development would require reform efforts that incorporate these characteristics. Effective and efficient administrative system, including public sector management, promotes and strengthens democracy and good governance. An effectively functioning civil service is essential in order to ensure that democratically elected leaders are able to protect the rights of citizens and mobilize resources through taxes and other sources in order to pay for police, judges, and the provision of services. A consolidated democracy requires administrative capacity of the state to maintain law and order, and to promote and protect public goods such as environment. Public sector management capacity to perform the above and related tasks, however, requires merit based recruitment of qualified personnel, effective human resource development strategies, motivation and commitment of civil servants, and transparent processes for policy formulation, budgeting, and implementation. Good governance, the prime pre-requisite of Afghanistan, refers to the question of how a society can organize itself to ensure equality of opportunity and equity (social and economic justice) for all citizens. Good governance is a value in itself, but it is also the most critical means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)– the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the achievement of universal primary education, the promotion of gender equality, the reduction of child mortality, the improvement of maternal health, the fight against HIV/AIDS, polio and other diseases, and the promotion of environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development. The government established on sound grounds of protection and promotion of right of every individual, is liable to achieve the heart and soul of masses and universal development goal alike –such act of governing is in fact in accordance to sprite of democracy.",{},"['promote', 'development', 'political', 'public', 'rights', 'opportunity', 'justice', 'democracy', 'social', 'administrative', 'system', 'equality', 'enshrines']","Democracy, development and human rights are therefore interdependent.

The Erosion of Moral Values,"Opinion: characteristic privilege is  that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social. He is  governed not by a material environment brutally imposed on him, but by ...",,"February 18, 2014","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","“Man’s characteristic privilege is that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social. He is governed not by a material environment brutally imposed on him, but by a conscience superior to his own, the superiority of which he feels. Because the greater, better part of his existence transcends the body, he escapes the body’s yoke, but is subject to that of society.” Emile Durkheim. She was about 65 years old talking with a burst of emotion in a street of Kabul City. A strong feeling was easily noticeable in her tone of voice. Five passersby gathered her listening. She said with painful heart that a man took her money to bring her a tin of oil and disappeared. “It is about two hours that I have been waiting for him, but he is not back yet. I was given the money by my stepson. If I return home with empty hand, he will kick me out of home.” She said to the passersby. “He has swindled you.” Said one of the onlookers and they all left her alone. The drops of tear sparkled in her eyes and she was standing with despondency and chagrin. Although, she was smoldering with pain, no one felt the flames of her burning emotions. Her face was reflecting her great worry and disappointment. But was it people’s business? This story demonstrated three major problems which are rife in our society. First, cruelty and violence against women was easily noticeable in her words. She was greatly worried about being treated harshly or even being kicked by her stepson. Moreover, bigamy is a usual tradition in our society which mostly leads to domestic violence. In other words, a bigamist man frequently treats his old wife unfairly. Therefore, the Afghan women suffer mentally and physically from this issue. Nelson Mandela says very beautifully, “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex, we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.” Secondly, poverty is one of the major problems being suffered by Afghan people and paving the way for crime and corruption. For instance, administrative corruption, robberies and theft and cultivating narcotic drugs are highly prominent in our society which originates from poverty. This chronic problem has challenged the lives of thousands of Afghan people. In addition, moral codes and religious laws are eroding. Religious values are deeply marginalized in our individual and collective life. People are involved in criminal activities such as robbery, theft, swindling, deceiving, hypocrisy, etc. Humanity is threatened to death by human beings. Our feet are tightly chained by our worldly desires. We trample upon the rights of our own fellow without feeling a tinge of guilt. The people’s main claim to fame is to gain self-interests at the cost of their moral codes and religious beliefs. Our bodies may be free, but our souls are the real prisoners of our whims and lusts. Hence, human empty of humanity is the disease of our society and century. Albert Einstein says very aptly, “A human being is part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. The true value of a human being is determined by the measures and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self. We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive.” Unfortunately, nowadays nobody feels a sense of devotion and co-operation. If a neighbor or a member of the same society is knee-deep in a difficulty, the other members just ignore inhumanly. Dedication is construed as idiocy and the more dishonest one is the more clever s/he is called. In short, moral standards are metamorphosed. Therefore, this is a great tragedy. As human beings, aren’t we supposed to share our joys and pains? Sharon Sequeira says, “If for some reasons one of us is having a genuine difficulty in accomplishing our task, it is important for the others to pitch in and help out in order that the wheels of progress are not slowed down or stopped. Just imagine for a second how an automobile cannot move if we get a flat in one of the tires even though the remaining three tires are fine.” Sharon talks about being committed in our tasks and carrying out our responsibilities in the best possible way saying, “We constantly must be aware that we should be doing our work diligently if we only for a moment think that we are doing our tasks to the best of our ability to please our God. Hence, irrespective of whether we are being observed by our peers or superiors we should be doing our best to complete our tasks to the best of our abilities.” It is worthy of mention to say that when one lacks moral standards and religious boundaries, prevailing law will not be respected. I believe that the role of moral standards in one is the strongest factors that can stop from committing crime. However, if morality dies in the soul of a nation, then crime will rise. I conclude that trampling upon moral standards and religious instructions will lead to crime and corruption in a society.",{},"['society', 'human', 'women', 'erosion', 'best', 'values', 'humanity', 'religious', 'moral', 'standards', 'woman', 'crime']","“Man’s characteristic privilege is that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social.

International Women’s Day,"Opinion: Hillary  Clinton states very nicely, There cannot be true democracy  unless womens voices are heard. There cannot be true democracy unless women  are given the opportunity to take ...",,"March 08, 2014","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of, the day. A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray. Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses, For the people hear us singing, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses. As we come marching, marching, we bring the greater days. The rising of the women means the rising of the race. No more the drudge and idler that toil where one reposes. But a sharing of lifes glories, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses. Hillary Clinton states very nicely, “There cannot be true democracy unless women’s voices are heard. There cannot be true democracy unless women are given the opportunity to take responsibility for their own lives. There cannot be true democracy unless all citizens are able to participate fully in the lives of their country.” She adds, “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights. Let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely — and the right to be heard.” In 18th century, when women were brought to industrial companies in America and Europe, they suffered seriously from laboring long hours in return for low income. In other words, their employers exploited them to such an extent that they felt compelled to raise their voice against their injustice. Their protest was the first spark which bore fruit in 19th century. On March 8, 1857, garment workers in New York City marched and picketed, demanding improved working conditions, a ten hour day, and equal rights for women. Their ranks were broken up by the police. Fifty-one years later, March 8, 1908, their sisters in the needle trades in New York marched again, honoring the 1857 march, demanding the vote, and an end to sweatshops and child labor. On February 28, 1909, the first National Woman’s Day was observed in the US. The US Socialist Party designated this in honor of the 1908 garment workers’ strike in New York. In 1910, the Socialist International, meeting in Copenhagen, established a Women’s Day, to honor the movement for women’s rights and to build support for achieving universal suffrage for women. The proposal was greeted with unanimous approval by the conference of over 100 women from 17 countries, which included the first three women elected to the Finnish Parliament. No fixed date was selected for the observance. In 1911, as a result of the Copenhagen initiative, International Women’s Day was marked for the first time, in 19th March, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, where more than one million women and men attended rallies. In addition to the right to vote and to hold public office, they demanded women’s rights to work, to vocational training and to an end to discrimination on the job. This view that women are somehow inferior to men is not restricted to one culture or belief. It is widespread. Women are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many societies. Moreover, women suffer many challenges such as gender bias, violence, sexual harassment, and etc. all around the world. At their most repugnant, the belief that women must be subjugated to the wishes of men excuses slavery, violence, forced prostitution, genital mutilation and national laws that omit rape as a crime. But it also costs many millions of girls and women control over their own bodies and lives, and continues to deny them fair access to education, health, employment and influence within their own communities. The impact of these patriarchal beliefs touches every aspect of our lives. They help explain why in many countries boys are educated before girls; why girls are told when and whom they must marry; and why many face enormous and unacceptable risks in pregnancy and childbirth because their basic health needs are not met. It is not women and girls alone who suffer. It damages all of us. The evidence shows that investing in women and girls delivers major benefits for everyone in society. An educated woman has healthier children. She is more likely to send them to school. She earns more and invests what she earns in her family. Ill-fatedly, women suffer from social and domestic violence in our society to a large extent. They fall victim to men’s cruelties in one way or another. For instance, in the current solar year, Afghan women underwent highly tragic incident. They were flogged and stoned in desert court, stabbed and shot to death, killed by axe, raped and a woman’s nose and lips were lopped off. In addition, numerous Afghan women committed to working for peace and development have been murdered, including four policewomen, a local government worker and a pregnant school teacher. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) announced on November 25th, which was the International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women, that a 25 percent jump in reported cases of human rights violations against women in Afghanistan in 2013. The AIHRC released a report on the same day, which stated that 4, 154 cases of human rights violations had been filed by Afghan women in only six months of the current solar year. The AIHRC added that violations against women can include psychological, physical, sexual, economic and verbal mistreatment. I would like to conclude my article with Nelson Mandela’s statement as he says, “As long as we take the view that these are problems for women alone to solve, we cannot expect to reverse the high incidence of rape and child abuse. Domestic violence will not be eradicated. We will not defeat this scourge that affects each and every one of us, until we succeed in mobilizing the whole of our society to fight it.” He adds, “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our women.

New Poppy Blight Poised to Boost Opium Price: U.N.,"News: VIENNA - A fresh blight is poised to hit Afghanistan's poppy fields this year, driving up opium prices and threatening to fuel a shift to potentially lethal heroin substitutes like ""krokodil"", the U.N. drugs watchdog said on  ...",,"June 28, 2012","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","VIENNA - A fresh blight is poised to hit Afghanistans poppy fields this year, driving up opium prices and threatening to fuel a shift to potentially lethal heroin substitutes like ""krokodil"", the U.N. drugs watchdog said on Tuesday. Plant diseases destroyed nearly half the 2010 opium harvest in Afghanistan, the worlds biggest producer, but output there rebounded 61 percent last year, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its 2012 World Drug Report. That helped put global opium production at 7,000 metric tons (7716.2 tons) in 2011, still more than a fifth below the 2007 peak. ""We may anticipate that this year there will be another plant disease - maybe not to the same scale as 2010 - but (it) still may affect, especially in the southern part of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation,"" UNODC Executive Director Yuri Fedotov said. ""This means that the production of opium may not increase or may even decrease, but at the same time definitely it would lead to an increase in prices for the next year. That is something we need to address very seriously."" The UNODC report cited indications that shortages had encouraged users in some countries to replace heroin with other substances such as desomorphine - whose street name is krokodil - acetylated opium, and synthetic narcotics. Krokodil is a crude, codeine-based drug that users inject, risking serious health problems as it attacks body tissue. ""It is a powerful drug which can kill people in just two months, in a few weeks,"" Fedotov said. It was hard to gauge what impact the 2010 crop failure in Afghanistan had on major markets, the report said, but drug seizures fell in most countries getting Afghan opiates. Some European countries, including Britain and Russia, saw heroin droughts. Opiate prices in Europe and the Americas had not changed much since 2009, officials said, but farm-gate prices in Afghanistan and number-two producer Myanmar kept rising in 2010 and 2011. A kilo of opium costs around $200-$250 in Afghanistan. Rising prices at times of increasing output could reflect under-reported demand from Asia and Africa, a growing market for raw opium not made into heroin, a parallel market for morphine or speculation on local markets, the report said. Drug syndicates also tended to stockpile opium to be able to smooth out supply fluctuations, UNODC officials said. CANNABIS ON TOP The 2012 report showed overall use of illicit drugs seems to have stabilized but was on the rise in several developing countries, especially those along trafficking routes. Fedotov cited as an example growing consumption of cocaine in West Africa, now a transit route for shipping Latin American supplies to Europe, increasingly from Bolivia and Peru as output in Colombia - mainly bound for North America - declines. Cannabis remained the worlds most popular illicit drug, with between 119 million and 224 million established users worldwide, the report said. That was followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), the use of which was largely stable, although methamphetamine and ecstasy appeared to be on the rise. Seizures of methamphetamine more than doubled in 2010 from 2008 due to big hauls in central America and Asia. Ecstasy pill seizures more than doubled in Europe from 2009 to 2010, and the drugs use seemed to be rising in the United States and Oceania. The report stressed the health and security threats illicit drugs posed, renewing UNODCs call for an integrated approach to reducing both supply and demand. ""Heroin, cocaine and other drugs continue to kill around 200,000 people a year, shattering families and bringing misery to thousands of other people, insecurity and the spread of HIV,"" Fedotov said. Around 230 million people, roughly five percent of the worlds adult population, are estimated to have used an illicit drug at least once in 2010. Around 27 million, or 0.6 percent of adults, are problem drug users, mainly of heroin and cocaine. By contrast, surveys have shown 42 percent of adults drink alcohol and a quarter use tobacco. Fedotov said his agency was looking into reports that Uruguays government planned to legalize the marijuana market as part of a drive to stop rising crime. ""If these reports are confirmed, of course it will be a disappointing development,"" he told reporters, citing international conventions against such a step. ""Cannabis is not so innocent as some people prefer to describe (it),"" he said, noting its users faced irreversible physiological changes and often moved on to harder drugs.

Public sector management capacity to perform the above and related tasks, however, requires merit based recruitment of qualified personnel, effective human resource development strategies, motivation and commitment of civil servants, and transparent processes for policy formulation, budgeting, and implementation. Over the period past 50 years, the concept of public administration has gone through four phases ranging from public administration to governance. First being public administration that was historically perceived to be a set of state structures, institutions, and processes. It was characterized, among others, by hierarchy, continuity, impartiality, standardization, legal-rational authority, and professionalism. Among others, it was expected to provide human security and protection of property, establish and enforce societal standards, and sustain the rule of law. Yet, in practice, traditional public administration is severely criticized for red-tape, slowness, paternalism vis-à-vis citizens, waste of resources, and too much focus on process and procedures instead of results, which is currently experienced in this landscape. The second phase being public management, focused on the application of management principles including efficiency in utilization of resources, effectiveness, customer orientation, reliance on market forces, and greater sensitivity to public needs. It called for expanding the role of the private sector and correspondingly, minimizing the size of the public sector and the domain of traditional public administration. It sought to use private sector principles in public sector organizations. The third phase, is New Public Management (NPM), continued the previous trends. It focused on outcome-oriented partnerships between the public and the private sector to provide services to citizens. Its main principles were: Firstly, flexibility for the managers to cope with on-going changes in the national and global environment i.e. steering rather than rowing; Secondly, empowerment of citizens to promote more efficient, entrepreneurial, and results–oriented management; Thirdly, new responsibility mechanisms that go beyond compliance mechanisms to search for innovations and results over process; Fourthly, introducing business principles into public affairs including out-sourcing and contracting out; Fifthly, promoting professional ethics in the public sphere; and sixthly, performance management and budgeting as stated by UN. The fourth phase is the governance that has been defined as a system of values, policies, and institutions by which a society manages its economic, social, and political affairs through interactions within and among the state, civil society and private sector. It comprises the mechanisms and processes for citizens and groups to articulate their interests, mediate their differences, and exercise their legal rights and obligations. It is the rules, institutions, and practices that set limits and provide incentives for individuals, organizations and firms, according to UNDP 2000. There are three actors involved in governance: the State, which creates a conducive political and legal environment; the private sector, which generates jobs and income; and civil society, which facilitates social and political interaction. The essence of governance is to foster interaction between these three types of actors to promote people-centered development. Although governance is one fabric, for the sake of analysis and entry points for action, it can be divided into three dimensions. Political governance means the range of processes through which a society reaches consensus and implements regulations, human rights, laws, and policies. Economic governance is the architecture for national and international economic activities, including processes to manage the production of goods and services and to organize and protect natural, fiscal, and human resources. Social governance is the set of norms, values, and beliefs that guide society decisions and behaviors. Each dimension of governance affects and interacts with the other two dimensions. Good governance, the prime pre-requisite of Afghanistan, refers to the question of how a society can organize itself to ensure equality of opportunity and equity (social and economic justice) for all citizens. Good governance is a value in itself, but it is also the most critical means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals – the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the achievement of universal primary education, the promotion of gender equality, the reduction of child mortality, the improvement of maternal health, the fight against HIV/AIDS, polio and other diseases, and the promotion of environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development.

Kabul: Life Threatening Winter,Opinion: According to  Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kabul will get  less snow this winter but will see higher levels of pollution. They warn that  if Kabul residents...,,"November 27, 2016","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","According to Afghanistans National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kabul will get less snow this winter but will see higher levels of pollution. They warn that if Kabul residents do not pay special attention to what they use as fuel, the pollution levels will increase and will cause more disease. In the past few years, especially in the past few months, the percentage of patients with pollution-related illnesses has increased. Officials from Indira Gandhi Childrens Hospital says about 200 children who suffer from respiratory illnesses are brought to the hospital for treatment each day as a result of increasing pollution. Therefore, the capital residents should be aware of life threatening upcoming winter. However, the Ministry of Public Health says they have plans to deal with the problem of pollution, should it increase. They say that in cooperation with the EPA they will announce an emergency situation and people will be banned from going to heavily polluted areas and schools will be closed for a period of time. The bitterly cold winter can be more dreadful when imagine with the highest number of internal and external displacements, homelessness, jobless, widespread production of pollution and growing insecurity; since the start of the March, 2016 more than 450,000 people have been displaced in the country and thus the officials admit their failure due to insufficient financial resources to meet the challenge. Statistics show that currently the number of internally displaced people across the nation is estimated to be over 1.2 million in total. And about one million people are expected to return to Afghanistan by the end of March 2017 from Pakistan mainly due to tension strains increased between two countries. Frequently, Afghan capital city had been recognized as one of the unhealthiest in the world, surrounded by hills that trap pollution for days. The customary smoke producing fuels, old cars, lack of standard roads, accumulation of garbage and overpopulations are counted as major factors. Afghanistan’s capital, a city built for half a million people but currently there are about four million people. Only 5 percent of Kabul’s homes are connected to actual sewerage systems, while most household waste flows straight into open roadside drains. Often their effluvia do not make it far enough to join the floating hypodermic needles and assorted muck of the Kabul River. According to health experts, air pollution is now the greatest cause of death, killing thousands of people a year – more than from war, terrorism, road accidents or HIV and Aids. Air pollution is also bad in other Afghan cities such as Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Mazar. In non-winter seasons, the emissions of old cars reportedly cause 70 to 75 per cent of air pollution in Kabul. And yet, tens of thousands of second-hand, substandard cars are imported every year, and the resulting air pollution may lead to an estimated 3,000 yearly fatalities, according to the Afghan Ministry of Health. In fact, Afghanistan has become a junkyard for old cars. Import of old cars (anything over five years) need to be banned. Those in the West who were going to pay $1,000 to impound their old cars have now found a way to make $1,000 on those old cars by selling them to people who ship them to Afghanistan, there should be strict control over the exhaust pollution of cars. Regular technical checks must be imposed. Those who dont pass emission tests must be heavily fined and the cars must not be issued permits. Over the years, due to population growth and the increasing number of such vehicles on the road, the problem has grown more challenging, and it is viewed that everybody is now susceptible to [health hazards caused by] air pollution in Kabul. As reflected in UNEP former reports, most of the fuels used in Afghanistan do not comply with international standards and contain high levels of lead. Lead in the environment that poisons the brains of Afghan children living in urban sprawls and reduces their learning ability and other air pollutants that are threatening the public health every day, killing many citizens every day. More than 70 per cent of the countrys eastern and southeastern forests have been cut down to export wood to feed neighboring country highly lucrative lumber business - an enterprise that serves only to line the pockets of Afghanistans warlords-cum-statesmen. Moreover, the mismanagement of pistachio forests has not only damaged the eco-balance in northeastern parts of the country, but it has left tens of thousands without a source of income. However, as per article 15 of Afghanistans constitution, the state is obligated to adopt necessary measures to protect and improve forests as well as the living environment. Finally, the fight against environmental pollution is as much important as to fight against terrorism! Government has to update the system of garbage collection, control of walking old cars from Kabul streets, ban the import and use of substandard fuel, and as soon as possible commence the new Kabul project to expand the city; Because a large population produces a large amount of garbage, and with no systematic garbage collection and garbage disposal result larger piles of garbage and pollution. On the other hand, public media, educational system, civil society, police and etc must collaboratively work to promote the culture of how to live in a city. We should be aware that lack of public awareness and lack of culture of urban life is a big part of problem as here the last thing on people’s minds is air quality and the environment.",{},"['winter', 'million', 'pollution', 'public', 'kabul', 'cars', 'health', 'threatening', 'life', 'air', 'garbage', 'old', 'city']","According to Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kabul will get less snow this winter but will see higher levels of pollution.

Afghanistan: The Most Dangerous Place to Live,Opinion: Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to  live a healthy life. Due to poor quality health care services the wealthier  choose to seek care in other countries but the poorer have to...,,"October 23, 2016","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to live a healthy life. Due to poor quality health care services the wealthier choose to seek care in other countries but the poorer have to frequently die and suffer. According to reports, in Kabul one in five had travelled outside Afghanistan to seek the care they required, most of them heading to neighboring countries; While border provinces almost one in ten and one in twelve had gone abroad to seek treatment for an illness of someone in their household. The long distances people must travel to seek care not only delay the provision of urgently needed treatment, but also force them to undergo perilous and costly journeys. Nevertheless, there have been some achievements in past 15 years but it is not sufficient because one third of entire population still lack access to very basic healthcare services while others go abroad due to low quality services. Beside war, insecurity and long distances, high costs are also an important barrier to access healthcare for many people in Afghanistan; travelling to distant, better health facilities often increase expenses, forcing families to become indebted to provide treatment for relatives. These include non-medical costs for transport to and from the health facility, accommodation and food, in addition to the actual medical costs. Despite the fact that healthcare should be free of charge, as promised under the national free care policy (article 52 of the national constitution) this is not the case in many public facilities. Instead, people must pay for drugs, doctor’s fees, laboratory tests and in-patient care. Overall, households in Afghanistan spent on average more than 9,000 Afghani on healthcare (around 150 USD). It is notable that urban households had a significantly higher level of expenditure than rural households, which is likely related to lower urban poverty levels and better access to health services. In a country where, according to the World Bank, more than one third of the people are living below the national poverty line of less than $1.25 USD per day, such expenditures can be crippling. People always complain about the poor quality of the public health system, including of staff and services; lack of appropriate drugs; and an improperly functioning referral system. It seems that public system is obsolete; patients often had to wait for a long time to be treated. For instance, in clinics those are open only in the mornings, women experiencing complications during labour at night or other times of the day or wounded patients who need immediate medical care are not cared for in time. Corruptions such as Informal fees, low quality or smuggled medicine and are another worrying problems, considering that costs pose an important barrier to access healthcare. People often have to pay bribes in order to be seen by a doctor in a public clinic. Others spoke of doctors in public clinics pushing people to their after-hour private practice, saying that it was better equipped. People also regularly complained that public clinics in remote areas sold their drug supplies to pharmacies, so that patients had to buy them instead of receiving them free in the clinic. The importation of poor quality medicine is another serious issue. It is said that about 90% of Afghanistan’s pharmaceutical products are imported while 50% of them are illegally imported. As a result, the quality of public services is often perceived to be low, even if this is not always the case. For instance, assessment of the public clinics in certain provinces district showed that general primary healthcare provision appeared to be functioning well. At the time of the visits, all public health centres are open and providing consultations free of charge and seemed to have adequate levels of patient attendance. But distrust in the public health system causes many people to prefer private clinics and private doctors, who are perceived to be better in terms of quality. Yet, the quality in private system is not necessarily justified; many complain of overprescribing, misdiagnosing and even malpractice and medical mistakes by private practitioners. They also try benefit from the bad reputation of the public sector and ask high fees for their services. More than half of Afghan girls and boys suffer damage to their minds and bodies that cannot be undone because they are poorly nourished in the crucial first two years of life. High levels of Malnutrition in Children is rate of stunting is around 60%, underweight rate is around 40%, Anemia rate is around 50% in children, High iodine deficiency: 72%(school age) and also the high levels of Malnutrition in Women is Iron deficiency: 48.4%, non-pregnant and Iodine deficiency 75% and high levels of chronic energy deficiency are 20.9% low BMI. There are about two million addicts in the country while the numbers are increasing due to lack of serious fight against opium products. Likewise, the figure of communicable disease especially HIV/AIDS are in increase because of boost in number of drug users, the number of injuries and disabled rising due to security condition in the country, the air-pollution, which is responsible for up to 70% disease of urban area, is also deteriorating. As final points, having happy, healthy and well-talented lives depend to having quality health services and strategies; we must know that if we do not have sound body, we cannot have sound mind. We should realize that food and food experts play very important role in a society. We must understand that Pregnancy and infancy are important periods for the formation of the brain, laying the foundation for the devel­opment of cognitive, motor, and socio-emotional skills throughout childhood and adulthood. Children with restricted development of these skills during early life are at risk for later neuropsychologi­cal problems, poor school achievement, early school dropout, low-skilled employ­ment, and poor care of their own children, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty.",{},"['place', 'high', 'quality', 'dangerous', 'public', 'healthcare', 'care', 'health', 'live', 'poor', 'private', 'system', 'afghanistan', 'services']","Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to live a healthy life.

The Daily Outlook Afghanistan,Opinion: A  very critical and hazardous obstacle along with the Afghan security and  political development is the challenging matter that is for sure the drug  planting and growing in an eye catching ...,,"June 06, 2013","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","A very critical and hazardous obstacle along with the Afghan security and political development is the challenging matter that is for sure the drug planting and growing in an eye catching ratio. A survey shows that nearly 90% of the world narcotic is grown in our homeland Afghanistan. This has not only been a domestic catastrophe for the Afghan civilian but for the globe too. The ministry of social health care centers announced that nearly 2.5 million of Afghan civilians are addicted to intoxicating stuffs such as opium, hashish, chars and many other harmful drugs. The annual export of opium from Afghanistan is astonishing whilst the government cannot really take any sort of serious actions against the high growth of drug addiction in Afghan civilians. In particular the young and fresh stratum of our community has been vulnerable through decades concerning drug addiction. It is not only the male gender who suffers from this pernicious disease but recently the female gender has also been involved in such activities. The point to ponder about is there are not any specialized care centers to treat and cure the addicted people. What is drug addiction and what harms and side effects it causes for the health of addicted people? Drug addiction is a dependence on an illegal drug or medication. When you are addicted, you may not be able to control your drug use and you may continue using the drug despite the harm it causes. Drug addiction can cause an intense craving for the drug. You may want to quit, but most people find that they cannot do it on their own. For many people, what starts as casual use leads to drug addiction. Drug addiction can cause serious, long term consequences, including problems with physical and mental health, relationship, employment and the law. Drug addiction is a complex brain disease. It is characterized by compulsive, at times uncontrollable, drug craving, seeking, and uses that persist even in the face of extremely negative consequences. Drug seeking becomes compulsive, in large part as a result of the effects of prolonged drug use on brain functioning and, thus, on behavior. For many people, drug addiction becomes chronic, with relapses possible even after long period of abstinence. Many people do not understand why and how other people become addicted to drug. It is often mistakenly assumed that drug abusers lack moral principles or will power and that they can stop using drugs simply by choosing to change their behavior. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease. And quitting takes more than good and firm intention or a strong will. In fact, because drug change the brain in ways that foster compulsive drug abuse. Quitting is difficult even for those who really want to do so. Through scientific advances, we know more about how drug works in the brain than ever, and we also know that drug addiction can be successful to help people stop abusing drugs and lead productive lives. Opium has been cultivated in Afghanistan since 1100 A.D., although production has steadily increased since 1979. Currently, Afghanistan produces three-quarters of the global opium supply, with injection drug use and HIV currently following the opium trade route through Central Asia. Although systematic studies are lacking, heroin use appears to be on the rise in Afghanistan. The purpose of this article is to briefly provide historical background and current statistics for drug production and use in Afghanistan, to discuss the new governments policies towards problem drug use and available rehabilitation programs, and to assess Afghan harm reduction needs with consideration of regional trends. The rise of the Taliban regime was marked with steady increasing opium production, despite their pledge to ""cleanse Afghanistan of the poisoned poppies. Increased opium production has been attributed to economic realities faced by the Taliban, who received little external donor support due to international sanctions. Historically, opium has been used in Afghan communities as medication for different conditions, particularly pain and respiratory complaints. Opium use also has a traditional role in the societies of some groups. There are few national estimates of opium use in Afghanistan; the highest regional use is noted in northeastern Badakhshan Province along the Tajik border, with 20–30% of the local population estimated to be addicted. High use rates have also been reported in districts of Herat and Farah Provinces. Although problem of drug use appears to be increasing in Afghanistan, addiction treatment remains limited. Medical services are provided to addicts through both public and private sectors, which, together, are not able to meet the demand for services. In the public sector, the National Mental Health Institutes, under direction of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), have functioning treatment and rehabilitation centers in several Afghan cities. The center in Kabul (Mental Health Institute) has only 30 treatment slots. In a few provinces, there are branches of the Mental Health Institute providing out-patient services, such as counseling, but these do not have an in-patient facility. Addiction has been a real problem for our society in particular in the capital Kabul if we put a glimpse over the environment of the capital there are thousands of problems from the pollution to addiction. Thousands of our youngsters are involved in such activities which are deadly dangerous for the future of our community. There is a dire need of changes in the policy of social challenges for the concerned government. Let’s make this our social, cultural, religious and humanitarian duty that each individual of us would feel his responsibility and act upon those responsibilities in the best way. We would urge from our youngsters to severely avoid using drugs either narcotics or tobaccos because everything gradually increases; people start from cigarette and consequently reach to heroin, opium, chars and other compulsive and irritating stuffs. It is thought that in a society where the young generation does not feel its duties and put the bucks on the other strata of the society’s shoulder that society is condemned to the harsh and dire penalties, however there is a bright flashes of hope in the fortune of our community if we shake our legs and feel the pain and sweat out our efforts to gain achievements and make our society free of every junks and punks.",{},"['society', 'addiction', 'mental', 'addicted', 'drug', 'health', 'afghan', 'opium', 'production', 'outlook', 'afghanistan', 'daily']","In particular the young and fresh stratum of our community has been vulnerable through decades concerning drug addiction.

Relation of Natural Disaster and Sin,"News: On Sunday, when I was making my way amidst crowd that  similarly was struggling not to get muddied as result of flash floods  overpowered roads, a group of old men were sitting on the  ...",,"May 06, 2014","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","On Sunday, when I was making my way amidst crowd that similarly was struggling not to get muddied as result of flash floods overpowered roads, a group of old men were sitting on the side of the road and blaming the prevalence of immorality as the main reason behind the natural disaster. They were of the view that landslide in Badakhshan province and flash floods in other provinces which have left hundreds dead and thousands homeless happen due to less commitment of people to religious issues and that is why Allah Almighty descent such natural disaster to punish people for their sin. One of them told that would people remain safe when a religious scholar raped an innocent girl? By saying so, he pointed to incident occurred in Baghlan province. Based on reports, a religious scholar by tricking wanted to rape her. But before he rapes, the father of the girl cuts the nose and ear of the Mullah. Religious scholars hold deep reverence and high influence among Afghan people, particularly in rural areas. Believe it or not, if a religious scholar opposes anything on whatever account, people will accept his stance and withhold not support. In other words, Mullahs are viewed as infallible and the very standard of good and bad. Some people view that as symbol of right and wrong---whatever they accept that is right and vice versa for their opposition. On the other hand, such deep reverence and respect has imposed a very critical responsibility on the shoulder of religious scholars. Their every step is watched. Thus, they should carefully dress and be so committed to religious issues. They offer prayer on time and do not miss any religious rituals without any acceptable excuses. Hence, if they commit any mistake their religious status wide acceptance among common people will get seriously affected. So, if for years, people used stand on behind Mullah and offered their and followed his instructions, suddenly they find out that perhaps was the kind of person they trusted. Certainly that would be a serious emotional blow to common people. Moreover, Mullahs are considered the symbol of religiosity. They viewed as the most trustable and spiritual figures. It is hard for common people to accept that someone who spiritual and aware of religious issues or simply the committed followers of Prophet Mohammad commit an adultery which to some extent is considered the most horrible moral crime. Thediscussion of group of old man indirectly was pointing to the same issue. If similar crime was committed by a common man or let’s say a non-Madressah educated person, people may not have reacted so harshly. For this category of people, adultery by a Mullah is sign of closeness of resurrection day or anger of Allah Almighty against sinful human beings. The interesting part is this that when similar natural disaster occur in non-Muslim countries, people start talking similar things about the anger of Allah Almighty against sinful residents. Now when such natural incidents take place in areas where people are generally good from a particular religious perspective that common people, they get confused about what is really wrong. No doubt, these spiritual concepts have been among human beings perhaps since their very familiarity with concept of God and spirituality and reflected differently in different religious groups. They were reflected in one or the other but interesting no body lose believes even when such concepts prove baseless and wrong. There is always justification takes the hands of people and their beliefs remain intact. For example, when a natural hit people, the reason behind is said to be sin and Allah punishes them. So, when the mountain slide removes reportedly 300 hundred homes of villagers, than it is related to sin of people in other parts of the country. In this philosophy, human beings are considered as jangle soil. If a jangle gets fired, all of them may get burned. And so, for the sin of an individual, thousands must pay the price. For instance, top religious scholars of Islamic republic just years ago were criticizing western countries and branding HIV as curse of Allah Almighty because of moral corruption. But soon the diseases spread in Islamic countries and now no one can claim that it is curse of Allah Almighty for the Western countries. Needless to say, modern individualism has not found its way to this collective mentality. For the sin of an individual, many are responsible. Just putting a glimpse to society, we can easily found that such collective thinking is visible in each corner of people’s lives. As said, for the sin of an individual many are responsible. For example, if a girl gets raped, not only the rapist is sinful but his entire family members or his community. Sometimes punishment of the criminal is enough from traditional court but number of others from the same community or those who related to him by blood should get punished. Thus, during history for a small crimes, the entire community has got blamed not only the individual. If a girl escape with a boy, along with the boy other community should pay the price. Baad or marrying girl for resolving disputes sometimes happen because of the same collective punishment. It is highly likely that once individuals spread and everyone is responsible for their own deeds, part of social and legal issues will be resolved and a Mullah may not lose ear and nose for sin he just wanted to commit.",{},"['common', 'disaster', 'allah', 'natural', 'almighty', 'community', 'religious', 'issues', 'sin', 'girl', 'individual', 'relation']","Thus, they should carefully dress and be so committed to religious issues.

Uphold the Spirit of Democracy!,"Opinion: Afghanistan has been ravaged  by years of conflict. Subsequent  to Taliban’s regime toppled, Afghanistan was put on the way to democracy, the  established and wide practiced system of ...",,"January 01, 2014","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","Afghanistan has been ravaged by years of conflict. Subsequent to Taliban’s regime toppled, Afghanistan was put on the way to democracy, the established and wide practiced system of government. Afghan national institutions are severely factional and lack a cohesive national security culture. In other words, Afghan institutions are not sufficiently focused on defending their own national interests. Influential Afghan figures continue to promote patronage networks further institutionalizing favoritism and corruption. The Afghan government continues to give free rein to well-known warlords and human rights abusers as well as corrupt politicians and businesspeople, further eroding public support. Reconstruction of the economic and political institutions through better administrative reforms is perhaps the most important means to ensuring long-term success of a state. The September 11 tragic incidence turned a blessing in disguise for Afghans that brought Taliban’s repressive and despotic rule to an end. Subsequently, the modes of government altered but not the fate of people. The installment of democracy devoid of its fundamental requisites left the people suffer at the hand of non-conforming elements, insurgents and terrorists who at present seem to have grown mightier than previous. The centralized government brought forth, is perceived as continuation of denied political rights. The completion of two democratic terms and slight betterment in women rights and a small degree of freedom, of course, count the successes of the democratic government. The most crucial aspect that left undermined or ignored must be given prime importance in order to ensure vibrant democracy, as underlined below. The ultimate goal of democracy is to preserve and promote the dignity and fundamental rights of the individual, to achieve social justice, foster the economic and social development of the community, strengthen the cohesion of society and build a favorable environment for international peace. Democracy, development and human rights are therefore interdependent. The government has been poor enough to ensure all such provisions of democratic system. It ascertains people’s participation to play an active role in political and civic life. One expresses his will through regular free and fair elections. Voting in a democracy must be universal, equal and secret so that each of us can choose our representatives freely which is not witnessed in Afghanistan till date. Education and vibrant communications media are vital to be able to make an informed choice. Literacy rate touches the ground and media is highly restraint. The roles of citizens end after they cast their ballots; they aren’t continually engaged in public affairs thus they are kept ignorant of their right and duties. The Afghan population currently has few means of expressing dissent regarding policies carried out by the international community and the central government, which operates on a highly centralized patronage model in which power and resources are channeled through personal and political allies. The system lacks the connection, rules, and checks and balances necessary to make leaders truly accountable to the domestic population, which invites corruption, rent-seeking, and a hemorrhaging of domestic legitimacy. Local governmental bodies are the appropriate places for representing Afghans and responding to their needs, but these currently suffer from a lack of capacity, confusion over their roles and authorities, and little legitimacy. Incorporating the promotion of equality and dignity through the system of equal value for the vote of all individuals regardless of their sex, religion, language, economic or social status in democracy ensures political justice which is the foundation of social and economic justice, dignity of the individual and national cohesion. Without a well-functioning government apparatus, administrative system and an efficient and productive economy, no state will be able to maintain basic state functions. The objective is to strengthen planning and auditing activities, promote quality assurance, implement public welfare policies, organize management of human resources, maintain ongoing efforts to reform the administration and fight against corruption, and lay the foundations for managing finances and procurement. These broad based objectives can be met by inventing an efficient administrative system that could relief Afghanistan out of lingering administrative problems. In that pursuit a democratic institution must be built on structures and processes that are accountable, transparent, decentralized, and able to manage legitimate elections and the administration of justice, and operate under the oversight of the parliament. Furthermore, it should combat exclusion, protect public goods, actively engage civil society and the private sector, promote participation, and strengthen partnerships among sectors, groups, and every levels of government. Revitalizing public administration for people-centered development would require reform efforts that incorporate these characteristics. Effective and efficient administrative system, including public sector management, promotes and strengthens democracy and good governance. An effectively functioning civil service is essential in order to ensure that democratically elected leaders are able to protect the rights of citizens and mobilize resources through taxes and other sources in order to pay for police, judges, and the provision of services. A consolidated democracy requires administrative capacity of the state to maintain law and order, and to promote and protect public goods such as environment. Public confidence in the political system and subsequently the political legitimacy of the government – is increased where the public service delivery system is effective, where the public officials are accessible to local citizens, and where government agencies and departments work together in well coordinated, complementary ways. Equally important is the capacity to govern, to make important policy choices, design and implement programs and actions to achieve policy objectives, and anticipate emerging trends and challenges. Public sector management capacity to perform the above and related tasks, however, requires merit based recruitment of qualified personnel, effective human resource development strategies, motivation and commitment of civil servants, and transparent processes for policy formulation, budgeting, and implementation. Good governance, the prime pre-requisite of Afghanistan, refers to the question of how a society can organize itself to ensure equality of opportunity and equity (social and economic justice) for all citizens. Good governance is a value in itself, but it is also the most critical means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals – the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the achievement of universal primary education, the promotion of gender equality, the reduction of child mortality, the improvement of maternal health, the fight against HIV/AIDS, polio and other diseases, and the promotion of environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development. The government established on sound grounds of protection and promotion of right of every individual, is liable to achieve the heart and soul of masses and universal development goal alike –such act of governing is in fact in accordance to sprite of democracy.",{},"['promote', 'political', 'development', 'public', 'rights', 'justice', 'democracy', 'social', 'administrative', 'system', 'uphold', 'spirit']","The centralized government brought forth, is perceived as continuation of denied political rights.

A Tangible Change,"Opinion: It is not necessary that everyone should open a school, you can take 2-3 children of poor families to a school and bear their expenses or you can go to a good school and inform the school ...",,"July 04, 2013","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","I was travelling by the public coaster and it was passing through the slums of the city. Everything was saddening. There were children crying in the streets. Majority of these children were bare-footed and bare-headed and shivered in the cold winds of winter. The mere look of these children could either arouse disgust or pity, but nothing pleasant. There were youngsters with dim and frustrated faces, lacking the light of youth in their eyes. Majority of them appeared to have come from work, which was apparent from their mud-filled hair and torn skins. There were old men who seemed to be struggling to sustain their lives. There were men who looked very exhausted to make the ends meet. I also witnessed a woman shouting with a shopkeeper. I am sure her money had fallen short, as always, and would be trying to make the best of the bargain in this regard. This is not limited to the people only. Dark and small houses, stinking and dirty streets, and other limited facilities make the life even more difficult and dull. Similarly, children could have been noticed bringing water from far places. Electricity and other civic facilities are only a dream for them. Then let’s go to another part of the city. As you enter the area, you immediately develop a pleasant feeling. There are big houses which are spread on a large area. Every house has a large garden or a lawn where you can see children playing happily, and they appear as if angels have landed who are cherishing the innocent and pure joys of life. These children are wearing the most beautiful imported clothes which have further enhanced their innocent beauty. At times, we see an old man or lady who appears to be healthy, contented and having a strange haughtiness in his or her style. Everything attached with this community shouts loudly that they are the chosen ones. Latest and shining cars, beautifully decorated rooms, clean and silent streets, covered by green trees on both the sides of the road, and every single facility has been improvised with every minute detail. Both of the above scenarios can have absolutely opposite impacts on the people. For a person who is struggling hard to keep himself or the family alive, the best recreation is to have food enough to fill up his belly or feed his family. With such a background, almost everyone is caught in the fear of economic failure and thus everyone tries to make some addition to the income of the family. There are men who walk to work and when they return home, they are absolutely tired and disappointed, as their meager income never meets their expenses. Once I was studying the behavior of workers while drinking tea in breaks and it surprised me how they can long such avariciously for a single cup of tea. Such a desire and feeling is very difficult to be understood unless a person gets into the same situation and feels the taste of a cup of hot tea which is offered to you when you are hungry and working in cold for a number of hours. While sitting in a hot and pleasant room, adequately supplied with fruits and drinks, we can never understand this philosophy. Here, the biggest loss is the loss of being dignified and respectable. As you loiter here and there without much attention and importance, slowly and gradually you develop a feeling that you are of no use to anyone and thus you lose your credibility in your own eyes. In short, moments of joy and recreation are very less and every difficulty lands on them to be very severe. Aids or HIV is not a disease itself. It makes your immunity system very weak and thus your body cannot fight or overcome diseases and thus any small illness like flu or cold becomes fatal and doesn’t leave your body. You might have noticed members of a very poor family fighting or shouting on petty issues that seem to be very less important to us like buying a pair of shoes to the children but if one doesn’t have enough money to buy bread, can hardly make any such expense. On the other hand, let’s have a look at the behavior or the situation of the rich. First, they are very much busy in carrying out their businesses or jobs and sometimes don’t find time to their family members but when they get free, they have their own attachments and interests. Elders are mostly found busy in buying new cars, houses or attending social gatherings where they sit with the people of their own kind. Youngsters are busy in buying new gadgets and looking for opportunities to pass their times in a variety of interesting ways. Older members of this group enjoy the comfort that has been supplied with the wealth of the family and make sure that this set up of prosperity should exist and continue. At times, their conscience is shaken by the miseries of people around them but they have a proven weapon to repel this attack by saying, ‘These are the lazy people. Nobody gifted me this prosperity and I earned it by my hard work, luck and better thinking strategy. If they cannot think better or their luck is not clicking, then how can I help?’ Some of them try to silent this inner voice by giving out some money to poor or doing other similar temporary works of charity and thus they free themselves from the court of their conscience. Some of them even say this, ‘I am happy and have a good life and I haven’t created any problem to anyone and have not harmed anyone, then why I should I blame myself for this?’ But it is said that if there is fire at one corner of the city and you are not taking any kind of responsibility to control, it would definitely reach to your house as well and turn it into ashes. French revolution is one of the most bloody and tragic examples of such a situation when the gap between the poor and the rich reached to an extent that only the blood of sacrifice could fill up the space. Rich were having pleasant and wonderful lives while poor were only struggling to keep their existence. When poor saw that the scenario was not going to change and rich were fully drunk in their luxuries, they rose and then set each and everything of rich into fire. They killed thousands of rich and did not spare even their children or families. It thus becomes the responsibility of rich to do something permanent to bring equilibrium in the society. It doesn’t mean that they should give easy money to the poor and develop the habit of laziness in them. There is a Chinese saying that, ‘Don’t give me the fish, rather teach me how to fish’. In the same way, we can take steps that can bring permanent and positive changes in the lives of poor. Very easy way is to establish schools where deserving poor children should be given free education. This experiment has successfully been done in Turkey which has changed the fate of the nation. It is not necessary that everyone should open a school, you can take 2-3 children of poor families to a school and bear their expenses or you can go to a good school and inform the school administration to support 2-3 poor students and they would easily make the rest of the arrangements. Educating 2-3 students is not so difficult but if every one of us starts this work, this would definitely bring a great change in the society. Otherwise, I fear that we can also face an Afghan revolution which might be bloodier than the French revolution.",{},"['times', 'work', 'children', 'rich', 'tangible', 'school', 'poor', 'money', 'pleasant', 'family', 'tea', 'change']","Majority of them appeared to have come from work, which was apparent from their mud-filled hair and torn skins.

Pakistan, India and Somalia ranked third, fourth and fifth, respectively, in the global survey of perceptions of threats ranging from domestic abuse and economic discrimination to female feticide, genital mutilation and acid attacks. ""Ongoing conflict, NATO airstrikes and cultural practices combined make Afghanistan a very dangerous place for women,"" said Antonella Notari, head of Women Change Makers, a group that supports women social entrepreneurs around the world. ""In addition, women who do attempt to speak out or take on public roles that challenge ingrained gender stereotypes of whats acceptable for women to do or not, such as working as policewomen or news broadcasters, are often intimidated or killed."" The poll by TrustLaw (www.trust.org/trustlaw), a legal news service run by Thomson Reuters Foundation, marked the launch of its new TrustLaw Women section, a global hub of news and information on womens legal rights. TrustLaw asked 213 gender experts from five continents to rank countries by overall perceptions of danger as well as by six risks. The risks were health threats, sexual violence, non-sexual violence, cultural or religious factors, lack of access to resources and trafficking. Some experts said the poll showed that subtle dangers such as discrimination that dont grab headlines are sometimes just as significant risks for women as bombs, bullets, stoning and systematic rape in conflict zones. ""I think you have to look at all the dangers to women, all the risks women and girls face,"" said Elisabeth Roesch, who works on gender-based violence for the International Rescue Committee in Washington. ""If a woman cant access healthcare because her healthcare isnt prioritised, that can be a very dangerous situation as well."" LITANY OF PERILS Afghanistan emerged as the most dangerous country for women overall and worst in three of the six risk categories: health, non-sexual violence and lack of access to economic resources. Respondents cited sky-high maternal mortality rates, limited access to doctors and a near total lack of economic rights. Afghan women have a one in 11 chance of dying in childbirth, according to UNICEF. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), still reeling from a 1998-2003 war and accompanying humanitarian disaster that killed 5.4 million people, came second mainly due to staggering levels of sexual violence in the lawless east. More than 400,000 women are raped in the country each year, according to a recent study by U.S. researchers. The United Nations has called Congo the rape capital of the world. ""Statistics from DRC are very revealing on this: ongoing war, use of rape as a weapon, recruitment of females as soldiers who are also used as sex slaves,"" said Clementina Cantoni, a Pakistan-based aid worker with ECHO, the European Commissions humanitarian aid department. ""The fact that the government is corrupt and that female rights are very low on the agenda means that there is little or no recourse to justice."" Rights activists say militia groups and soldiers target all ages, including girls as young as three and elderly women. They are gang-raped, raped with bayonets and have guns shot into their vaginas. Pakistan ranked third largely on the basis of cultural, tribal and religious practices harmful to women. These include acid attacks, child and forced marriage and punishment or retribution by stoning or other physical abuse. ""Pakistan has some of the highest rates of dowry murder, so-called honor killings and early marriage,"" said Divya Bajpai, reproductive health advisor at the International HIV/AIDS Alliance. Some 1,000 women and girls die in honor killings annually, according to Pakistans Human Rights Commission. TRAFFICKING India ranked fourth primarily due to female feticide, infanticide and human trafficking. In 2009, Indias then-Home Secretary Madhukar Gupta estimated that 100 million people, mostly women and girls, were involved in trafficking in India that year. ""The practice is common but lucrative so it goes untouched by government and police,"" said Cristi Hegranes, founder of the Global Press institute, which trains women in developing countries to be journalists. Indias Central Bureau of Investigation estimated that in 2009 about 90 percent of trafficking took place within the country and that there were some 3 million prostitutes, of which about 40 percent were children. In addition to sex slavery, other forms of trafficking include forced labor and forced marriage, according to a U.S. State Department report on trafficking in 2010. The report also found slow progress in criminal prosecutions of traffickers. Up to 50 million girls are thought to be ""missing"" over the past century due to female infanticide and foeticide, the U.N. Population Fund says. Some experts said the worlds largest democracy was relatively forthcoming about describing its problems, possibly casting it in a darker light than if other countries were equally transparent about trafficking. Somalia ranked fifth due to a catalogue of dangers including high maternal mortality, rape and female genital mutilation, along with limited access to education, healthcare and economic resources. ""Im completely surprised because I thought Somalia would be first on the list, not fifth,"" Somali womens minister Maryan Qasim told TrustLaw. ""The most dangerous thing a woman in Somalia can do is to become pregnant. When a woman becomes pregnant her life is 50-50 because there is no antenatal care at all. There are no hospitals, no healthcare, no nothing. ""Add to that the rape cases that happen on a daily basis, the female genital mutilation that is being done to every single girl in Somalia. Add to that the famine and the drought. Add to that the fighting (which means) you can die any minute, any day."" Poll respondents included aid professionals, academics, health workers, policymakers, journalists and development specialists.

There has been always a link between hunger and global security. Fighting to end hunger among the nations worldwide is the first most important step in ensuring the global security and even achieving peace among the nations. Perhaps, there could be no permanent global peace as long as two-third of our human families is daily under the dominant of worlds worst killers, ""Hunger"" and famine. In fact, hunger and Insecurity are the worst threat to peace and security. Who are the poor? Countless numbers of babies who are born in poor parents have grown up as poor. Many became poor due to hard circumstances that dominated Afghanistan in the last decades of war and constant drought. Most of them belong to those families whose breadwinners died, murdered, massacred or became permanently disabled in the fight against Taliban or in civil war. When everything most of the families own is lost in a natural disaster or in a communal violence. When ones possessions are taken away because one is powerless, voiceless or unable to repay money borrowed to farm a land or to pay for a girls dowry or to pay for curing a killer illness. When one is born with disability and no one is ready to support the disabled. When the head of a household suffers from unemployment and cant earn enough to fulfill the gap. They are the common faces of poverty in Afghanistan. Kabul has been dominated by various threats and challenges in the past decades due to unbroken war, and other evils such as discrimination, hunger and famine. As a result, thousands of families left the country and immigrated to neighboring countries for their survival. As, Afghanistan is steeped in bold challenges, there is another growing threat to both its political and social stability ""Hunger"". Beggers are increasing on Kabul streets, children and women are in grave situation and yet there has not been any single concern over this crisis; neither by Afghan government nor by any other humanitarian NGO on the ground. Our respected government authorities have not even insight about the situation, because they have never seen the worst face of hunger in their whole life time. Perhaps, they never bother to walk down once on the streets so that they would become aware of the sufferings that this war-torn nation faces. Why even bother with poverty? The region faces major issues like, terrorism, communal violence, HIV/AIDS, restless youth, deforestation, worst ever pollution, road accidents, shortages, corruption, fighting, unstable neighbors, Taliban-led insurgency and so on. Lets begin with the poor, voiceless and powerless parents children who from early morning till midnight are running about the streets, asking the drivers to clean their cars for one Afghani, and asking for alms from the people on the streets. Most of them are malnourished and seldom receive nutritious food. Hunger and famine damage their brain and retard both their mental and physical growth. They are deprived from getting education and other social benefits. Later, when they grow up, they remain weak, get frequently sick, and have little or no education at all for choosing the right path towards a better and sustainable future just like rich citizens. Similarly, this nation has repeatedly indentified poor and unemployed and these are the driving forces behind insecurity and instability. According to a recent Oxfam study, ""seventy percent of Afghans surveyed face poverty and unemployment, as the major cause of the conflict in the region."" Some people participate in insurgent activities to acquire an income. Joining anti-government oppositions or undertaking other illegal activities, such as drug production and trafficking, is often more well-paid, and with immediate returns, than struggling with farming or working in the informal sector for low wages while a fortunate daily laborer earns a maximum of 4$ a day. Moreover, this is broadly believed that poverty in Afghanistan is both a cause and a consequence of the exclusion faced by a high proportion. The everyday reality on streets and pathways are obscured by poverty statistics is that the people are often hungry and that they have limited access to health care. Most of them cannot read or write and some may even sell a child, probably a girl to feed the rest of the family. Their children are begging or working instead of going to school, and they are more vulnerable to violence as they lack the protection that patronage corruption and alternative security arrangements. There are debates in every official meeting and conference on how to confront the Taliban or other insurgent fighters or invest on short-term development process. But fighting hunger and helping the poor and voiceless people has never been under the debate or if it was, yet nothing helpful has happened as this persistently continues to affect the lives of people and security situation in the region. Local people due to hunger are joining the Taliban or other fighting groups. While the government authorities are talking about the rise in insecurity, they must understand that investment on poor families may guarantee a permanent peace and stability. This investment means better educated societies, more stable societies and the chance for better economic growth. Escalation of food aid in Afghanistan, means reducing the level of death, insecurity and other killer disease, which are the cause for illegal earnings due to lack of access to basic food services, unemployment and hunger. Perhaps, Afghanistan doesnt need guns for killing, but rather food and education through which they can kill the killer ""Hunger"". Today poverty and hunger kill more Afghans than those of armed conflicts or suicide bombers. The region has the worlds second-highest maternal mortality rate, the third-highest child mortality rate. Therefore, if we do not help the infants and toddlers of the poor, we will end up supporting youths and adults of poor competence. And this creates a problem. When a poor child grows up to be an adult, he/she will likely remain uneducated, untrained and unemployed for the rest of his/her life. Surrounded by such circumstance, these adults can be persuaded to carry out violent acts or become terrorists or undertake unhealthy or dangerous activities that will create both social and political unrest in a region as of now and this will likely portend both social and political unrest and drive the nations into Stone Age. In fact, poverty is paralyzing Afghanistan. The world must pay more attention towards it. The debates on peace process and other political issues have long been going on but they have persuaded no convenient achievement, instead worsen the situation. Now is the time that the government and the international community pay little more attention on fighting the poverty. The region will lose more individuals if the international community and other donating organizations on the ground keep silent. All those who feel responsible for protecting a life, now is the time to take an initiative for saving the lives of Afghan children, women and families who live in grave hunger.",{},"['continue', 'families', 'hunger', 'afghans', 'suffer', 'poor', 'peace', 'fighting', 'worst', 'poverty', 'region', 'streets', 'afghanistan']","They are the common faces of poverty in Afghanistan.

Afghan Women – The Victim of Patriarchy,Opinion: A man has been charged with raping his  15-year-old daughter – who is now pregnant and under medical care in Jawzjan  province – local news report. Police criminal...,,"September 19, 2015","Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the Leading Independent Newspaper.","A man has been charged with raping his 15-year-old daughter – who is now pregnant and under medical care in Jawzjan province – local news report. Police criminal offenses department director Abdul Hadi confirmed the report and said the man was in police custody. Hadi added that the man apparently threatened to kill his daughter if she spoke out about the case. Violence and violation of rights weighs heavily on women. As long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance. As long as outmoded ways of thinking prevent women from making a meaningful contribution to society, progress will be slow. As long as the nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself, it is doomed to failure. Violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men. Moreover, it is the manifestation of an unequal power between men and women. The images of abused and helpless Afghan women incessantly flood our minds, undermining the significant role of women as agents of change in Afghanistan. During the 1920s and 70s, a period of economic and political stability, a large number of Afghan women asserted their rights and continued their education and professional pursuits. These women belonged to a privileged economic background; all the same their role and aspirations offer the world an alternative narrative. Acknowledging the agency, contributions, and strong voice of Afghan women does not undermine the stories of women like Nazai, an 18-year-old Afghan woman whose nose and ears were sliced off by her husband and appeared on the cover of Time magazine in August 2010, or Sitara, a 30-year-old women whose nose and lips were lopped off by her addict husband in Herat province in 2013 and their audacious spirit. And the appalling story of Farkhunda, who was lynched to death on March 19 in Kabul, haunted not only Afghan nation but the whole world. The history of Afghan women’s struggle for social recognition and equality chronicles Afghanistan’s physical and cultural devastation. Following the Soviet Invasion (1979-89), the Afghan Civil War (1994-96) and the dictatorial regime of Taliban (1996-2001) women’s access to education, security and jobs has been minimal. Today, in the post-Taliban era, the Western “liberation” and Islamic fundamentalism each impose their own values on Afghan society as political models. Westernization, with regards to gender equality, does not take into account the traditional concept of family in Islamic or Afghan culture and tends to negotiate the rights of Afghan women outside their community and family. The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially has an impact on their lives that they are impeded to exercise their human rights, for instance, the fear for contribution to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. The gang rape occurred in the Paghman district of Kabul was one of the worst cases of violence against our women. As it is still debated on the national media, armed men stopped a convoy of cars that was driving back to the city from a wedding in the district of Paghman in the morning of August 23, 2014. The men dragged four women to the side of the road, where they robbed them and beat them up, the screams of the victims in earshot of male relatives they were traveling with. Three of the women were raped without a tinge of humanity. A research found many risk factors that increase the chance of Afghan women experiencing domestic violence. Some of these include being in a forced, underage, or polygamous marriage, living in rural communities or communities with greater Taliban control, and the presence of strict gender role perceptions. Factors that decrease the chance of domestic violence include employment of spouses, consensual marriage, literacy of both women and men, living in urban communities, enjoying economic stability, and perceived satisfactory gender relations. It should be noted that human rights are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights “to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being,” and which are inherent in all human beings regardless of their gender, belief, ethnicity, creed or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others. They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances, and require freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution. It is aptly said, “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.” Although the integral sources of the Afghanistan’s law root in Islamic Sharia which hold human and his rights, including women’s rights, in high esteem and also our country has ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and ICCPR, yet the human rights are violated to a large extent and women are bereft of their rights in some ways. Hope the government acts more seriously and protects the rights of the citizens, especially the women’s rights.",{},"['human', 'women', 'men', 'patriarchy', 'rights', 'role', 'gender', 'afghan', 'womens', 'victim', 'woman', 'violence']","As long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance.

At the same time, Afghanistan ranks one of the worst countries in the world in terms of the health of the population. In his masters thesis, Maisam Najafizada has looked into the way Afghan televisions have been dealing with health issues. In his attempt to respond to three main research questions, Maisam has identified a number of significant points in the realm of Afghan health, the media and the relationship between the two. The research and its findings Researchers have found that the media, in particular television, has so far been a major source of health information for public, with the potential to influence audiences thinking, attitude, behaviour, and decision-making process regarding health issues. This research aims to understand how the media of a war-torn state like Afghanistan deals with health issues of the country – a country that started to build its basic infrastructures including health and media from scratch in 2002 with the support of the international community. This research looked into three months broadcast of Dabestan Bo Ali and Darmelana television shows to respond the following three research questions: 1.What health related stories do Afghan national private televisions broadcast? 2.How do the Afghan private national televisions frame health stories? 3.What health-related socio-cultural practices are televised through Afghan national, private televisions? The study finds that Afghan television media broadcasted health stories on food and environment safety (25%), maternal and infant health (21%), oral and dental health (18%), child health (11%), mental health (7%), communicable disease (4%), and other health issues (14%). The study revealed that the media equally held responsible individual and societal factors for health problems, while individual behaviour change was frequently mentioned as the solution rather than societal change. Talking about womens issue and critiquing traditional/religious healing were taboos just a decade ago, although the media has managed to inform the audience on and implicitly disapprove of harmful cultural norms i.e. health-seeking behaviour and gender-related norms. Interesting finding was that female presenter or guest in the health show increased female participation over the phone in Darmalena. But the way the media dealt with socio-cultural practices were very primitive and there was no indication of any evident public health strategy in the health shows. Points of discussions Public health and its priorities. Although the media carried one story on health infrastructure in which the Health Minister spoke about health policy, there was no mention of health policy, health infrastructure, public health performance, and quality or quantity of public health services. Major public health concerns in Afghanistan, according to the Ministry of Public Health, are maternal and infant care, child care, communicable disease, and mental health. Instead of the major concerns, food and environment safety topped the frequency of coverage with oral and dental care in the third place. On the contrary, communicable diseases, which are easily preventable by little health information, received the poorest coverage; that too not about any major communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, HIV, or sexually transmitted disease. In addition, mental health that affects the war-ravaged people was the second lowest in the media health agenda. Interestingly, there was no mention of statistics or epidemic of disease over the entire six week of coverage in any television media, except one health news on a conference regarding gynaecology and obstetrics in which the health minister spoke of huge maternal death. This means the media has not been successful in giving awareness to the public regarding widespread diseases that affect the population the most. For instance, child health is the second important priority in the country, and the most critical disease that kill children under five are acute respiratory disease, pneumonia, diarrhoea, dysentery, malaria, and lack of vaccination. They are all easily preventable with a little knowledge about child care. Comparatively, the media had one story over the six weeks on newborn care and another on childs sleeplessness. Media and public health relations. This lack of awareness of major public health issues was indicative of the poor relation between the media and public health professionals. The poor relation was the result of weakness from both sides: the media and the public health professionals. Both fields were dominated by medical professionals. In the media, the medical doctors lacked journalism skills. In the public health industry, they lacked public health knowledge. Government journalism schools are remnants of communist-regimes to whom journalism meant a vehicle of communism ideology propaganda, and in regards to public health, there has not been a single public health school in the country since before the development of Kabul Universitys Public Health Administration program. All public health professionals have been trained as medical doctors who then followed a career in public health. Physician dominance in public health. The dominance of the health communication field by medical doctors not only influenced the topics covered in the media but also the way they were covered. The result of the frame studies of the media content indicated that very little information was provided regarding societal-level (public health) solutions to health problems. The frame studies indicated that the media blamed individuals behaviour and societal factors equally for the health problems, but in regards to the solutions to health problems, individuals behaviour change was the medias favourite rather than societal-level change. For what medical doctors care is disease and individuals health; and to prevent disease and promote health of the population at large is the duty of public health professionals. The research suggests that a number of factors that can help provision of better health information in the media are better training for journalists in the field of health, increasing female participation in the health media, taking advantage of modern communication technology such as mobile phone and internet, and better coordination between public health professionals and the media. The research also suggests a dire need for public health schools in the country.",{},"['content', 'public', 'media', 'care', 'medical', 'professionals', 'health', 'afghan', 'research', 'major', 'disease']","The study finds that Afghan television media broadcasted health stories on food and environment safety (25%), maternal and infant health (21%), oral and dental health (18%), child health (11%), mental health (7%), communicable disease (4%), and other health issues (14%).
