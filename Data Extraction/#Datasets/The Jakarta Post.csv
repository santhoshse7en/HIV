Curious about HIV/AIDS? Just Ask Marlo,A new online chat platform is the latest innovation that tries to raise public awareness about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-22,The Jakarta Post,"A new online chat platform is the latest innovation that tries to raise public awareness about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The platform called Tanya Marlo (Ask Marlo) features a character named Marlo who constantly reminds and informs users about HIV/AIDS. “Let’s take a HIV test!” Marlo says through the platform, which is integrated with the LINE application. Wearing a yellow shirt under a blue sweater, the bespectacled man encourages anyone, especially those who are sexually active, to take a HIV test at least once a year to maintain a healthy sex life. HIV is preventable, Marlo reminds users via the platform. The earlier the virus is detected, the earlier treatment can be administered, not only to improve the health of patients but also reduce or even eliminate the risk of transmitting it to their sexual partner. Therefore, taking a HIV test matters. It is estimated that 48 percent of the 640,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia are aware of their status, according to the Health Ministry. People who do not have HIV also need to understand HIV/AIDS to prevent them from discriminating against or stereotyping people with the condition. Being the subject of unwanted rumors is one of the reasons why many people are reluctant to take a HIV test. With many people in the country yet to fully understand HIV/AIDS, Marlo is ready to serve anyone who wants to seek information about it confidentially. He is aware that people with HIV/AIDS face stigma and discrimination in Indonesia, where talking about sex is deemed taboo. He therefore guarantees that any conversation with him is confidential. “Do you want to contact me through LINE or WhatsApp?” Marlo asks. The United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and developers Nimbly Technologies and Botika are behind Tanya Marlo. Together, they officially launched the platform last December. “Tanya Marlo is a mobile chat platform that is friendly and for people who need information about HIV/AIDS. We present Tanya Marlo to answer all challenges faced by people with the condition in Indonesia. We utilize digital technology as a new way to interact with the young who might not be able to access information about HIV/AIDS,” UNAIDS Indonesia country director Krittayawan Boonto said. Tanya Marlo is the world’s first chat-box about HIV/AIDS. To make friends with Marlo, a user first has to install the LINE app on their mobile phone. Then, users need to add @TanyaMarlo to their friends list. After that, they will see four features on Tanya Marlo; Consultation, HIV Test, HIV Info and Quiz. If users click the Consultation feature, they can chat to trusted counselors through LINE or WhatsApp. If users choose the latter, they will have access to the WhatsApp number of a counselor to communicate with him or her confidentially. The counselor will be a friend. This is why users do not need to feel embarrassed about asking anything, including questions that people generally deem taboo. Users, for example, may ask whether it is fine to have unprotected sex if they and their partner are HIV-positive. The HIV Info features articles, infographics and videos about HIV/AIDS, such as basic information like the difference between HIV and AIDS to the history of it, preventive measures, and treatment and care. The Consultation and HIV Info features will convince users to have the courage to take a HIV test. The HIV Test feature, meanwhile, will inform users about the locations of clinics that provide HIV testing services, including their hours of operation and the procedures they have to undergo. In Indonesia, where people who are HIV-positive can access treatment for free, there are more than 5,000 testing sites and over 600 antiretroviral (ARV) treatment centers, according to UNAIDS Indonesia. However, only 15 percent of people who know of their HIV status undergo ARV treatment. “The crucial element that is missing is the knowledge about HIV. Without the knowledge, people are unable to make life-saving decisions, such as getting tested and initiating ARV treatment to be healthy and productive,” said Krittayawan. The last feature of Tanya Marlo is the Quiz where users can test their understanding about HIV/AIDS. The Quiz features multiple-choice questions that debunk the most popular myths about HIV/AIDS, such as how the virus or illness is transferable through mosquito bites, sharing kitchen utensils and using the same toilet. HIV/AIDS activist Tesa Sampurno, who is openly HIV-positive, expressed appreciation for the launch of Tanya Marlo, expressing hope that more people would not be fooled by HIV/AIDS myths. He said living with HIV/AIDS was hard, while discrimination and stereotyping made it harder. Tesa vividly remembers the moment his family created distance with him after he was diagnosed with AIDS in August 2007. At that time, they believed that HIV could be easily spread through touch. “They refused to shake my hand. They even wrote my name on the cups and plates I used,” he said. Hailing from Bandung, West Java, Tesa said he got HIV from needles that he did not realize were unsterile when he was a drug addict from 1995 to 2000. The 34-year-old has proven that living with HIV is not a death sentence. He is still healthy thanks to ARV medicine that he drinks every day. He looks as well as anyone else. In October last year, he took part in the Jakarta Marathon, running the 42-kilometer race to prove that HIV-positive people can be as healthy as those who live without the virus. “The keys to keeping fit are exercising regularly, following a healthy lifestyle, avoiding stress and the most important thing is to be happy,” he said. UNAIDS is upbeat that Tanya Marlo will effectively educate people, especially the young, about HIV/AIDS. The Health Ministry’s data shows that around 52 percent of people who are newly diagnosed with HIV are young people aged between 15 and 24. Indonesia itself is one of LINE’s top three overseas markets with around 90 million registered users. Around 80 percent of them are millennials. The government has committed to end the spread of AIDS by 2030. By then, it is expected that 90 percent of people who live with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia will be aware of their status and 90 percent of these people will undergo ARV treatment.

Discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS evidence of ‘systemic failure’: Advocates,Regional health agencies only handle HIV/AIDS from a health perspective.,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-02-19,The Jakarta Post,"The Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC) has urged the government to establish a special working unit to increase public awareness about HIV/AIDS following recent cases in Surakarta, Central Java, and Samosir Regency, North Sumatra, of students living with HIV/AIDS being prevented from attending school following complaints from parents of other students. Earlier this month in Surakarta, 14 students of Purwotomo 74 public elementary school, who were identified as HIV positive, were transferred to special schools after protests from parents of other students. Parents and guardians of other students allegedly told the school’s management they would transfer their children to another school if the school’s management allowed the students with HIV to continue attending. The schools principal said he was of the view that every child had the right to education. However, he said he did not have a choice and was forced to transfer the students, who were studying in the first through to fourth grades. Read also: We had no choice: Surakarta school expels students with HIV/AIDS A similar case also occurred in Samosir regency in October last year, in which three HIV-positive orphans were not allowed to attend Welipa kindergarten and Nainggolan public elementary school by locals who feared they might get infected with the virus. They were also threatened with exile from the regency. However, after mediation involving school management, the local community and the regency administration, it was suggested that the children be homeschooled. Read also: Residents tell HIV-positive orphans to leave Samosir “This is very tragic and a systemic failure,” Aditya Wardhana, the executive director of the Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC), told The Jakarta Post on Monday. He said the government had caused a “setback” by terminating the National AIDS Commission (KPAN), which had representative offices across the country and had operated for more than 10 years, in 2017 following 2016’s Presidential Regulation on the commission for AIDS prevention signed by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo. AIDS control and prevention has been handled by regional health agencies ever since. “The agencies only handle HIV/AIDS from a health perspective. However, it must involve other aspects, such as social, economic and even the psychological aspects of each person infected with the virus,” Aditya said. He also said it was difficult for health agencies to intervene in school decisions because that required coordination with local education agencies. “The President should establish a special cross-ministerial working unit only for this issue in a bid to prevent this form of discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS in schools,” he said. Meanwhile, Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) commissioner Jasra Putra urged the mayors or regents involved to find a solution to discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS because the primary and elementary school were under their supervision. “They need to instill the school stakeholders, including teachers and heads of the schools, with the same perception regarding this issue,” he told the Post. Jasra said further that parents must also be made aware of the issue so they would not interfere or provoke school managements to expel students infected with the virus. “This concern will keep coming up if local governments do not help them to understand,"" he said. According to Jasra, each of the student’s health should be confirmed. “By doing this, they can prevent the HIV positive children from being isolated from their friends,” he added. Director of elementary school development at the Education and Culture Ministry, Khamim, stressed that each child must get an education. Both the health and education agencies in municipalities across the country have conducted campaigns about HIV/AIDS prevention, however, parents remain worried about their children being infected by their friends with HIV/AIDS. “Health agencies informed the parents that the children would not transmit their viruses to their children, but the parents wanted the infected children out of the school,” he told the Post.

HIV patient's remission spurs hope for curing AIDS-causing virus,"A stem-cell treatment put a London patient’s HIV into remission, marking the second such reported case and reinvigorating efforts to cure the AIDS-causing infection that afflicts some 37 million people globally.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-03-05,The Jakarta Post,"A stem-cell treatment put a London patient’s HIV into remission, marking the second such reported case and reinvigorating efforts to cure the AIDS-causing infection that afflicts some 37 million people globally. The patient has been in remission for 18 months. That’s too soon to label the treatment -- which used hematopoietic stem cells from a donor with two copies of an HIV-resistance gene -- as a cure, researchers said Tuesday in a study in the journal Nature. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to other blood cells. An embargo on the paper was lifted due to early reporting of the finding. The New York Times said Monday that the latest surprise success confirms that a cure for HIV infection is possible. Leukemia patient Timothy Brown, who became known as the “Berlin patient,” was treated aggressively 10 years ago in an HIV-curing approach that hasn’t been successfully repeated until Ravindra Gupta at England’s University of Cambridge and colleagues showed the effectiveness of a less aggressive form of treatment. The latest case was in an HIV-positive patient with advanced Hodgkin’s lymphoma who received a transplant of hematopoietic stem cells from a donor with two copies of the so-called CCR5 gene mutation -- the same one allegedly edited by He Jiankui that led to the birth of the world’s first gene-edited babies last year. “Coming 10 years after the successful report of the ‘Berlin Patient,’ this new case confirms that bone marrow transplantation from a CCR5-negative donor can eliminate residual virus and stop any traces of virus from rebounding,” said Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne, in a statement. Scalable approach The London patient has no detectable HIV virus, Gupta and colleagues said. “We speculate that CCR5 gene therapy strategies using stem cells could conceivably be a scalable approach to remission,” they said. Scientists at IciStem, a consortium of European scientists researching use of stem cell transplants to treat the illness, say the London patient received a bone-marrow transplant in 2016 and was given immunosuppresive drugs. He stopped taking his HIV medication in September of 2017. There are important limitations to applying the findings of the London patient to a HIV cure, said Anthony Kelleher, director of the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Still, the London case shows that “HIV cures are possible,” he said. Read also: Curious about HIV/AIDS? Just Ask Marlo Gene editing “Common to both approaches is the presence of a modified gene in our immune system -- CCR5 -- that is necessary for HIV infection,” Kelleher said in a statement. “This tells us that the feasibility, and importantly, the availability of delivering this approach could possibly be achieved by the rapidly accelerating field of gene editing and related gene therapies.” Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV and about 35 million people have died because of complications from the viral illness. Worldwide, an estimated 36.9 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. Progress against AIDS over the past 15 years has inspired a commitment by United Nations member states to end the epidemic by 2030. The number of people newly infected with HIV fell to 1.8 million worldwide in 2017, from more than 3 million a year through most of the 1990s. Researchers are developing better antiretroviral treatments, prevention methods, and vaccines to halt infections while continuing to pursue a cure for those already infected. That goal is “likely to be many years away,” said Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and an honorary consultant physician at Cardiff University. “Until then, the emphasis needs to remain on prompt diagnosis of HIV and initiation of life-long combination antiretroviral therapy,” Freedman said in a statement.",{},"['virus', 'stem', 'aidscausing', 'hiv', 'patients', 'million', 'gene', 'spurs', 'remission', 'curing', 'london', 'infection', 'cells', 'case', 'hope', 'patient', 'cure']","Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to other blood cells.

'We had no choice': Surakarta school expels students with HIV/AIDS,"Purwotomo 74 public elementary school in Surakarta, Central Java, expelled 14 students identified as positive for HIV/AIDS amid protests from parents of other students.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-02-08,The Jakarta Post,"Purwotomo 74 public elementary school in Surakarta, Central Java, expelled 14 students identified as positive for HIV/AIDS amid protests from parents of other students. Parents and guardians of other students allegedly threatened the school management that they would transfer their children to another school should the school management not heed their warning. School principal Karwi confirmed the report, saying, “We had no choice. We accepted the students because everyone has the right to education [..] until this wave of protests started to come in.” The parents heard about the presence of students with HIV/AIDS from a parents-teachers meeting in early January, during which they immediately expressed their concerns. The 14 students, who have been assisted by non-profit organization Lentera Foundation, come from different year groups. Lentera Foundation founder Puger Mulyono said he understood the parents’ concerns, noting that he had faced such rejection often. “We’ll deal with this. We’ll wait for the parents’ letter and recommendation from the education agency to transfer these students,” he said. Surakarta Education Agency Etty Retnowati said the agency had found a school that would accept the students. “The most important thing is they can continue their studies. We’ll always find solutions,” she said.

"Data of 14,200 HIV positive people leaked in Singapore","An American convicted of numerous crimes is believed to have leaked the information after obtaining it from his partner, a Singaporean doctor with access to the HIV registry, the ministry of health said.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-29,The Jakarta Post,"Confidential data of 14,200 people diagnosed with HIV, mostly foreigners, has been stolen and leaked online in Singapore, authorities said Monday, the second massive data breach in the city-state within months. An American convicted of numerous crimes is believed to have leaked the information after obtaining it from his partner, a Singaporean doctor with access to the HIV registry, the ministry of health said. It comes after the health records of 1.5 million Singaporeans, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, were stolen in a suspected state-sponsored attack in June and July, the countrys biggest ever data breach. ""Confidential information regarding 14,200 individuals diagnosed with HIV up to January 2013, and 2,400 of their contacts, is in the possession of an unauthorised person,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""The information has been illegally disclosed online... We are sorry for the anxiety and distress caused by this incident."" The information includes names, identification numbers, contact details, HIV test results and other medical information. Access to the information has been blocked but it is still in the possession of the person who leaked it -- and could be disclosed again, the ministry warned. Those affected are 5,400 Singaporeans diagnosed with HIV up to January 2013, and 8,800 foreigners diagnosed with HIV up to December 2011. Singapore, an affluent city-state of 5.6 million people, is home to many expatriates. The health ministry was notified by police last week that confidential information from the HIV registry may have been disclosed. The data is in the possession of Mikhy K. Farrera Brochez, a male US citizen who lived in Singapore from 2008 to 2016, the ministry said. He was convicted of fraud and drug-related offences in March 2017, and was deported from Singapore after completing his sentence. He is not currently in the city-state, the ministry said, adding that authorities were seeking assistance from their foreign counterparts. Brochez was the partner of Ler Teck Siang, a male Singaporean doctor, who had access to the HIV registry for his work. He was convicted in September of abetting Brochez in criminal activity, and sentenced to 24 months imprisonment. He is appealing.

'Our lives are at stake': People with HIV/AIDS face drugs scarcity,"HIV/AIDS treatment currently has the second biggest budget allocation from the ministry, after the allocation for vaccine procurement.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-12,The Jakarta Post,"Indonesia Positive Women Association (IPPI) national coordinator Baby Rivola’s cell phone has been buzzing day and night over the past two weeks. Women, mostly mothers with human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) from across the archipelago, have been telling her about their concerns after they heard that the nation was running out of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) antiretroviral drug (ARV), a tablet containing tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz (TLE). “Most of them have used FDC for years. But they said hospitals in their respective regions had ran out of FDC months ago and they had to start using single doses of those three drugs instead of the FDC,” Baby said on Thursday. The women were worried about their condition without the drug. They were also wondering about their treatment. “It is important for the mothers to take the pill regularly not only to save their lives but also to prevent the virus from infecting others,” she said. Taking TLE regularly is deemed the most effective treatment to reduce the HIV viral load in the body to an undetectable level. However, the tender to procure the drug recently fell through after the government and state-owned pharmaceutical companies PT Kimia Farma and PT Indofarma, the authorized producers of the drug in the country, disagreed on the pricing. TLE is the most used drug among people with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia. Around 48,000 people, or 42 percent of people with HIV/AIDS, rely on TLE. Aditya Wardhana, the executive director of the Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC), said even though the government had made an emergency procurement financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, the current supply of TLE would only last until April at most. “Honestly, we can die in less than a year if we do not take the drug. Our lives are at stake. What should I say to my children, because I really don’t know whether I’ll still be around them by the end of the year,” she said. The nation has pledged to reach the 90-90-90 target in 2027; 90 percent of people with HIV/AIDS will be aware of their HIV status, 90 percent of them get ARV treatment, and 90 percent of them have their viral load suppressed. The budget allocated for ARV treatment has also increased every year. In 2017, the Health Ministry allocated Rp 1.19 billion (US$84,673) to fund ARV treatment for 112,054 people with HIV. The allocation increased from Rp 243 million in 2015, and is predicted to reach 1.8 trillion by 2020. HIV/AIDS treatment currently has the second biggest budget allocation from the ministry, after the allocation for vaccine procurement. While lauding the government’s commitment to HIV/AIDS treatment, Aditya of the IAC said the nation “should not spend that much money on ARV treatment” because based on the coalition’s survey, the drugs could be purchased almost 400 hundred percent cheaper outside Indonesia. “Compared to other countries in the world, ARV in Indonesia is the most expensive one,” Aditya said, adding that he hoped Kimia Farma and Indofarma, as state-owned pharmaceutical companies, were not only seeking profit. “Even for a reasonable profit they could sell it for Rp 175,000 but instead they sell it at around Rp 400,000 per bottle. It is too expensive. One bottle only lasts for a month, so imagine how much money must be spent for that in a year for every person,” he said. The coalition also encouraged President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to immediately call on related ministries to help with the negotiation. When asked about the IAC’s view on the price of ARV, Kimia Farma president director, Honesti Basyir, said he “never heard about that statement and do not know how did the IAC compared the price with other countries”. “We always make our best effort to support the government program, as long as we are able to do it [..] since 2005, Kimia Farma has provided ARV for people living with HIV, even though the population of people taking ARV remains very small,” he said. The ministry’s director general for pharmacy and medical equipment, Engko Sosialine Magdalene, admitted that the tender had failed and explained that the price of locally produced ARV was higher in Indonesia as a result of the additional costs to produce the medicine. “We have to consider many costs, such as the import tax as well as cargo and transportation fees. When they [IAC] calculate the price, they should add these costs into their calculation as well,” Engko told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Engko also said the country had enough ARV supplies for the next 10 months. According to Engko, people with HIV/AIDS can still take fixed-dose drugs until this April and continue their medication with a single-tablet regimen as an alternative. Data from the Health Ministry show that over 2 million Indonesians have taken an HIV test. Of those, 314,143 were declared positive, with 212,240 having started ARV therapy since 2018.

"Students with HIV/AIDS should be allowed back to school, C. Java governor says",The 14 students haven't gone to school for a week.,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-02-18,The Jakarta Post,"Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo has responded to the recent expulsion of 14 elementary school students with HIV/AIDS in Surakarta, Central Java, calling on the relevant authorities to ensure the immediate re-enrollment of the students. The Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) politician wants every related party, especially the Surakarta administration, to immediately provide assistance to the students. “All citizens have the right to a good education. Children with HIV/AIDS should not be discriminated against,” he said in Semarang, Central Java, over the weekend. He also encouraged the parents of the expelled students to meet with Surakarta Mayor FX Hadi Rudyatmo immediately, adding that the expulsion was probably a result of a lack of awareness among parents of other students. “I want the parents who refused to have their children sit down in the classroom with the students with HIV/AIDS to have a discussion. They have to be given an explanation about what HIV/AIDS is, how it can be transmitted, and how to talk with them and so on,” Ganjar said. He also called on members of the public to refrain from being prejudice and acting in discriminatory ways against people and children with HIV/AIDS. “They should not be isolated. They need to be accompanied. Why exile people with an illness?” he said. Previously, it was reported that 14 children were expelled from Purwotomo 74 state elementary school in Surakarta following pressure on the school’s management by parents of other students. Read also: We had no choice: Surakarta school expels students with HIV/AIDS The students had been enrolled in the school from the beginning of the year, but were forced to stop attending because of the protests. The school’s management claimed it had no other choice. The 14 students, who have not attended school for a week, are currently being given assistance by the Lentera Foundation.

Stigma still thwarts HIV prevention,"Indonesia is one out of three countries that has seen an increase in HIV/AIDS along with the Philippines and Russia. While the world trend is decreasing, Indonesia failed to reduce the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus and mitigate the harm.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-12-26,The Jakarta Post,"Indonesia is one out of three countries that has seen an increase in HIV/AIDS along with the Philippines and Russia. While the world trend is decreasing, Indonesia failed to reduce the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus and mitigate the harm. Thus far, it has only managed to diagnose 47 percent of people living with HIV from an estimated 640,443 HIV positive cases; only 32 percent of people living with HIV received antiretroviral drugs from 301,959 diagnosed HIV positive cases and less than 1 percent of people living with HIV has been successfully treated and exhibited undetectable HIV in their blood. This gap is immense compared with 90 percent of the target for each indicator as urged by the United Nations Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS), which aims to eliminate HIV as a public health threat by 2030. Stigma and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS remain strong in Indonesia. Such stigma elicits an irrational or fear-driven negative attitude, behavior, and judgment toward people living with HIV and those perceived to be living with HIV. Recently, students living with HIV in Samosir, North Sumatra, and Tulungagung, East Java, feared being expelled from their respective schools. Such stigma and discrimination or fear of being stigmatized and discriminated against cause anxiety, depression, guilt, isolation, low self-esteem, disruption of family dynamics, physical and emotional violence, intensification of grief, and loss of social support. Self-stigma bundled with discrimination prevent people from accessing education and information on preventive behavior, refute risk, refuse to test, not seeking health assistance, delay treatment, and not adhering to therapy. This health-avoiding behavior results in the increasing HIV rate of transmission, declining of patient’s quality of life and a higher risk of AIDS-related death. This year’s World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, which was its 30th anniversary, addressed this issue with the theme “Know your Status”. Those afraid of being stigmatized may avoid even testing, let alone seek treatment. According to the Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) 2018, 65.2 percent of Indonesians have a poor understanding of HIV/AIDS. Misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS has contributed to public fear, stigma, and discrimination. People must understand that HIV/AIDS can be prevented and managed so that people living with HIV can live as healthily as normal people. Health workers have the credibility to inform society and convince them to destigmatize HIV/AIDS. Thus, health facilities are pivotal to help put an end to stigmatization and discrimination. They must be strengthened to empower people living with HIV. There are three important messages for health workers to circulate in society. First, with the advent of antiretroviral therapy, HIV is now a manageable disease. We can prevent HIV from becoming AIDS, a very dangerous late stage of the disease. AIDS-related deaths dropped dramatically from 11 per 100 persons per year in 1992 to 0.144 in 2006. HIV infection is no longer a death sentence as newer and safer drugs are available as the government provides free drugs to people living with HIV. Second, HIV transmission can be prevented by abstinence from sex with a high-risk partner, using condoms, and avoiding communal syringes. Transmission from mother to child can also be prevented during pregnancy as long as the mother takes her daily pills. Moreover, not all people who are HIV positive transmit the virus. Recent research shows that people living with HIV who take medication regularly and have undetected HIV in the blood (the virus is suppressed by the drug) do not transmit the disease. Third, this disease is not dependent on morality. Most patients (28 percent) are housewife and her vertically infected children, medical staff accidentally punctured by needles from patient and blood transfusion recipients. Our stigma-producing society makes such people suffer more. UNAIDS has identified that reducing stigma and discrimination is a critical part of the national HIV/AIDS program. Countries with low stigma and discrimination towards HIV/AIDS program have been more successful in their prevention and treatment program. As HIV infection rates are rising, Indonesia must destigmatize HIV/AIDS to reduce its transmission and HIV-related mortality in Indonesia. *** The writer is a physician who graduated from the University of Indonesia (UI) with experience in West Papua and Jakarta.

US performs first kidney transplant from living donor with HIV,"The kidney of a 35-year-old HIV-positive woman has been transplanted into another patient with the virus that causes AIDS, US surgeons announced Thursday, in a major medical breakthrough.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-03-29,The Jakarta Post,"The kidney of a 35-year-old HIV-positive woman has been transplanted into another patient with the virus that causes AIDS, US surgeons announced Thursday, in a major medical breakthrough. The surgeons at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore performed the operation on Monday, calling it the first in the world of its kind. ""Im feeling good,"" said the donor, Nina Martinez, at a news conference on Thursday following the surgery. The recipient, who has not been identified, is doing ""beautifully,"" said Christine Durand, associate professor of medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins. They are ""incredibly grateful for this gift and now we just monitor for the long term outcomes,"" Durand said. Martinez initially wanted to donate the kidney to a friend, but after that friend died, she pursued her wish to be an organ donor, Johns Hopkins said. The Atlanta resident, who was inspired to donate her kidney by an episode of ""Greys Anatomy,"" said she was excited to be part of a medical first. ""I knew that I was the one that they had been waiting for,"" she said. ""For anyone considering embarking on this journey, its doable. ""Ive just showed you how and Im very excited to see who the first follow-on might be."" Before this transplant operation, doctors had believed it too risky to leave an HIV-positive patient with only one kidney. The decision to move forward with the transplant highlights the confidence scientists have in current anti-retroviral medication, which allows those with HIV to lead normal, productive lives. Thousands of people die each year in the United States awaiting organ transplants. Doors are now open Dorry Segev, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said about 500-600 HIV-positive patients could donate organs each year, benefiting about 1,000 people with the virus. Until now, HIV-positive patients could receive organs from dead HIV-positive patients but not from anyone living with the virus. They could also previously receive an organ from someone who was not HIV-positive.

Johns Hopkins University Hospital received authorization in 2016 to move ahead with the first transplant from a living donor with HIV. Surgeons had been waiting to find compatible patients. Martinez and the recipient of her kidney will have to keep taking their anti-retroviral medication. ""The doors are now open for people living with HIV to become kidney donors,"" said Segev. ""Now anybody can do this anywhere in the world, provided that they screen the patients accordingly. ""For us, this is not only a celebration of transplantation but a celebration of the progress of HIV care,"" he said. ""And the fact that 30 years ago, a disease that was basically a death sentence has been so transformed, that today somebody with HIV can save somebody elses life."" Like other countries, the United States suffers from a shortage of donor kidneys and there is a waiting list of around 100,000 people, according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.

Debunking myths about HIV/AIDS,"Based on a study in 2016 conducted by UNAIDS, an organization under the United Nations dedicated to protecting those suffering from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), 36.7 million global citizens have been infected by the said condition.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"Based on a study in 2016 conducted by UNAIDS, an organization under the United Nations dedicated to protecting those suffering from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), 36.7 million global citizens have been infected by the said condition. It has been more than 30 years since HIV/AIDS was first detected, and through the years, there has been much improvement in the detection and treatment of the disease. Although most of the urban world claims to know the basics of what HIV and AIDS are – their causes, symptoms and prevention steps – there are untrue allegations that have been spread on the condition, leading to a series of myths that circulate within the community. In conjunction with World AIDS Day today, it’s timely that we once again debunk some of the more common myths about the disease. 1. HIV equals AIDS One prevalent myth is that anyone infected by HIV automatically has AIDS. This has grown to be the most common assumption since society finds it difficult to tell the two things apart. It is actually a fairly simple concept – AIDS is the result of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) damaging one’s immune system to the extent of leaving them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and illnesses such as fevers, mouth sores, lung diseases, yeast infection, and some cancers. In short, HIV is the contagion, and AIDS is the condition that can develop if it is left untreated. Those with HIV don’t necessarily have AIDS, but those with AIDS definitely have HIV. 2. Those with HIV look very sick When HIV-positive people are mentioned, society pictures sickly-looking ill patients, a widely believed misconception. This is not the case, as most of the time, those who are HIV-positive look just as well as anyone else. Even early symptoms of AIDS resemble typical illnesses, including sore throats, increased body temperature and muscle aches. Read also: People who live with AIDS in Jakarta increasing: KPAP 3. Touching spreads HIV Many think that AIDS can easily be spread through contact with someone who has the condition, for example, through drinking from the same bottle, sharing utensils, and using the same toilet. Some even think that touching a diagnosed person will spread the virus to them, making the act of merely shaking their hand seem like a daunting task. This false rumor about the virus has instilled a fear of interaction with HIV-positive people within society. Truth be told, HIV cannot be spread through touch, saliva or sweat, and thinking so belittles those with the condition. In most cases, the virus is sexually transmitted, spread through bodily fluids like semen, vaginal discharge and blood. 4. HIV means an early death Another myth we often mistake as truth is that being infected with HIV will ultimately lead to an early death for those diagnosed when they are young. Yes, having HIV is a risk to your health, but no, it is not a death sentence. Compared to three decades ago when it was just discovered, we have the advantage of top-notch medical technology and the best medicines readily available to prevent the deterioration of a HIV-positive person’s health, and as long as they maintain optimal living habits, an average 70 years of life expectancy can be seized. 5. Only younger people get HIV The belief that those of older age do not get infected by HIV is false. Believe it or not, UNAIDS suggests that approximately 4.2 million elderly adults above the age of 50 worldwide suffer from the problem. The older age group is often overlooked when it comes to HIV prevention programs. Unfortunately, many of them lack knowledge and understanding on the subject and almost half are unaware that they have been infected sometimes. Read also: A closer look at life as HIV-positive 6. HIV only affects homosexuals In the early 1980s, it was observed that HIV mainly affected men who engage in homosexual sex. This brings up one of the more contentious misconceptions circling global society regarding the condition, which is that those who only perform heterosexual intercourse are relatively safe from getting AIDS. In our world today, almost a quarter of those living with AIDS are heterosexual men and women, most likely those who precariously disregarded sex protection and HIV prevention due to the “only homosexuals get AIDS” stigma. 7. HIV-diagnosed women cannot undergo healthy pregnancies Having unprotected intercourse can result in the pregnancy of a HIV-positive woman, and more often than not, said pregnancies do pass without any serious complications caused by the virus. This defeats the myth that HIV-diagnosed women cannot undergo healthy pregnancies. Antiretrovial therapy can be taken during the pregnancy to ensure a healthy baby. 8. A pregnant woman with HIV will give birth to a HIV-positive baby Another misconception is that those born from a HIV-positive parent (or parents) will automatically contract the virus. The fact is, as long as the mother practices the dos and don’ts of pregnancy and sticks to the prescribed medications, the chances of birthing a HIV-positive baby are minimal. 9. It is all right to have unprotected sex if both partners are tested HIV-positive Another myth to be debunked is that it is seemingly all right to have unprotected sex if both partners are tested HIV-positive. Although there is no risk of the other person contracting the viral load, it will result in higher chances of catching other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) like hepatitis B and syphilis, as HIV destroys CD4 cells meant to keep said diseases at bay. 10. You won’t get HIV if you don’t have sex Many people assume that those who do not engage in any sexual acts at all are safe from ever getting infected by HIV/AIDS. This is not true, as many people get infected through substance abuse, or more specifically, through sharing needles with HIV-positives when injecting intoxicants in themselves. Similarly, unsterilized needles at tattoo parlors can cause one to catch the infection. Even though most myths that surround the HIV-positive community prove to be false, there are certain beliefs that are very much true, primarily the conception that the world’s minor ethnicities, mostly those residing in Sub-Saharan Africa, carry the most severe burden of AIDS in the world. Even in the US, the African-American community remains the most heavily impacted by AIDS. This happens because of socioeconomic issues, such as limited access to health facilities and education. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is not an easy one to combat, as there is no known, ultimate cure for it yet. But society’s presumptions on the matter also contribute in slowing down the progress of AIDS prevention in our world today. Doing research of what is true and untrue on this matter is crucial to hopefully decrease the number of victims of HIV/AIDS, as ignorance will no doubt lead to many more misconceptions about the condition.",{},"['infected', 'spread', 'myth', 'hivaids', 'virus', 'condition', 'hiv', 'prevention', 'myths', 'hivpositive', 'world', 'debunking', 'aids']","In conjunction with World AIDS Day today, it’s timely that we once again debunk some of the more common myths about the disease.

Keeping Indonesian children HIV-free. Can we?,What Indonesians should learn is that preventive action is far more important than a merely curative one.,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-05,The Jakarta Post,"The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Indonesia continues to rise. Since the United Nations millennium development goals were launched in 2000, the world has made tremendous gains in reducing new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and helping HIV/AIDS patients to live longer and healthier lives. With the 2016 UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN aimed to end the global HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. This includes zero infections, zero deaths and zero discrimination. The Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) urges HIV/AIDS to be addressed seriously because of its huge impact on increasing mortality, emerging socioeconomic problems and declining global productivity. Indonesia’s Health Ministry records show that the number of HIV/AIDS cases in children has been increasing significantly since 2010. HIV-infected children may not have AIDS, so those who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) early can grow and develop well. Children are largely infected with HIV through mothers during pregnancy (5 to 10 percent), birth (10 to 20 percent) and breastfeeding (5 to 20 percent). Meanwhile less than 10 percent of children are infected through contaminated needles, blood transfusions, or sexual violence from HIV-infected adults. To end this HIV infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented strategies focusing on primary prevention of HIV in women of childbearing age, prevention of unintended pregnancies in women living with HIV, prevention of HIV transmission from an HIV-infected woman to her infant and provision of appropriate treatment and support to women and children living with HIV. What Indonesians should learn is that preventive action is far more important than a merely curative one. Our neighbor Thailand was the first Asian country recognized by WHO for its target for eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission. The key is the high rate of antenatal care (ANC) provision. Voluntary HIV testing with same-day results is offered during the first clinic visit, followed by re-testing later in pregnancy for HIV-negative women. For HIV-infected pregnant women, ART is provided as soon as possible. Such treatment is available at a very low cost, thanks to Thai legislative changes that have allowed the non-commercial production of generic ART. Counseling services at antenatal clinics also promote dual methods of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy in women with HIV. These are the fruits of the early and concerted efforts of all sectors of Thai society — something Indonesia must emulate. In fact, the same approach had been applied by the Indonesian government regarding voluntary HIV testing for pregnant women. The government’s recommendation for pregnant women to undergo voluntary HIV testing is regulated in a 2013 Health Ministry circular on prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Unlike Thailand, however, this voluntary HIV testing in Indonesia still faces many obstacles. The first and foremost obstacle is the difficult access to antenatal services for most pregnant women in Indonesia. Only 80 percent of pregnant women go to ANC providers, leaving millions of expectant mothers unmonitored. This is related to the lack of knowledge about the importance of ANC, as well as unequal access to healthcare providers, a chronic unresolved problem. So how can all the pregnant women be tested, if they do not even undergo ANC? The government should promote the importance of ANC and ensure all pregnant women have access to ANC. The ANC should be included within the Puskesmas Keliling (mobile community health center) program, to reach as many pregnant women as possible. Second and worse, medical personnel are generally still hesitant to offer HIV testing to pregnant women, assuming they will refuse. Even if they are willing to, their husbands are often reluctant to allow them. There is also concern regarding the protection of women’s privacy and their risk of becoming stigmatized for having undergone HIV testing. Apparently, the strategies required by each country vary depending on local conditions. In Indonesia, HIV testing being voluntary instead of mandatory makes many think it unnecessary. Thus, the government should make HIV testing for pregnant women mandatory. This policy would not be a panacea for the continuing pandemic of perinatally transmitted HIV, given the lack of access to ANC. However, whenever feasible, governments and other healthcare providers should consider HIV testing to be mandatory for all pregnant women. In addition, HIV-infected mothers should obtain enough information about the pluses and minuses of formula and breast milk consumption. Breast milk is a vector for HIV after birth. According to WHO, HIV-infected mothers who choose to feed the baby with formula milk should meet the criteria of it being acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe. If families cannot get formula milk with the above criteria, mothers may still breastfeed their babies as long as they employ proper breastfeeding techniques and continue to take ART. This education should be done by healthcare providers, especially those in community health centers and Posyandu (integrated health service posts). For a long time, efforts to make all children HIV-free have run into many obstacles. We have had numerous lessons in the importance of working together to safeguard children. Since children are the country’s future, how the country responds to the problems they face indicates how highly the country values its future. _________________________ The writer is a physician at Permata Depok Hospital, West Java, and a Master of public health in sociomedical sciences candidate at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York.",{},"['voluntary', 'hivaids', 'children', 'hiv', 'anc', 'indonesian', 'keeping', 'hivfree', 'women', 'pregnant', 'health', 'testing', 'hivinfected']","HIV-infected children may not have AIDS, so those who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) early can grow and develop well.

Here are some things that I am doing to make sure I have a healthy, HIV-free kid.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-10-17,The Jakarta Post,"When I was first diagnosed as HIV positive, I never thought that I would have lived this long. I was infected through my late husband, who passed away seven years ago. I have never used drugs or had free sex, but my husband was a user, injecting heroin under his skin. In 2009, we were both diagnosed with HIV and my husband passed away not long after that due to late treatment. At first I was pessimistic, thinking it would be impossible for me to marry again. I was not even sure that I would survive and continue living. Things changed when I met a support group. My motivation and will to live slowly recovered. I joined a national network of women with HIV, Indonesian Positive Women Network (IPPI). From the group, I learned about sexual health education, reproduction, gender, human rights and how women with HIV like me have the same rights as any other Indonesian woman, including the rights to have a healthy spouse and children. In 2012 I met a man from outside the HIV/AIDS community. Two years later, we got married and decided to move from Jakarta to Bandung. Since the beginning of our relationship, we have constantly strived to deepen our understanding of HIV and pregnancy preparation. All in order to prevent HIV transmission to my HIV-negative partner and our future kid. Our dream has come true; I am pregnant in 2016. How can women with HIV have a healthy pregnancy? Here are some things that I am doing to make sure I have a healthy, HIV-free kid. Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy I’ve been in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for seven years. ART consists of drugs that function to suppress the growth of HIV in the blood, preventing the virus from attacking the immune system. This drug must be taken at an exact time every day. Aside from for health recovery, ARV is key for people with HIV who are planning on becoming pregnant. ARV is available at certain hospitals and community health centers (Puskesmas) designated by the government for the HIV/AIDS program and for free due to a government subsidy. You must consult your doctor before starting to take ART. (Read also: More HIV centers set up as cases rise) Condoms and its role Condoms are highly important for me and my husband’s sexual life. My husband is HIV free, and we are committed to keeping it that way. To prevent transmission from sexual contact, condoms must be used every time. Only during fertile days are we allowed by doctors to have unprotected sex in order to get pregnant. Routine lab checks During pregnancy planning, a complete blood check must be done every three months. I also have to do a routine immunity count ( CD4 ) check every six months. Lastly, there is also an HIV RNA or viral load HIV check to count the amount of virus in my blood. If your blood check is good, the doctor will give you permission to start pregnancy planning. No less important is the annual HIV check for my husband. In our second year of marriage, he is still healthy and HIV-free. After a series of blood checks, I was declared fit and ready to have children. Calculation of fertile days To minimize transmission risk, we only have unprotected sex during fertile days. Even though my immunity is good and the virus in my blood is undetected, there is still a possibility of transmission. I really had to learn how to calculate fertile days in order to get pregnant, and it worked! Last month there were finally two stripes on my pregnancy test. Pregnancy check: To which doctor? After getting pregnant, we have to decide the next step. We must consult a doctor, either a HIV doctor or gynecologist. In every hospital appointed by the government, there is a special work unit specializing in HIV. Among all doctors, there must be one gynecologists highly educated in HIV issues. Delivery method and breastfeeding Mothers with HIV can choose the delivery method and food choice for their newborns. This means that we too can have a normal birth and breastfeed. Of course, with certain precautions. There are medical conditions that we have to consider for mothers with HIV who are planning to have a normal birth, including their CD4 count and viral load, and the condition of the baby. The same goes with breastfeeding. If the mother is not medically fit, the doctor will advise a caesarian birth and infant milk formula. (Read also: Huge challenges remain to end AIDS by 2030) Mother-to-child transmission prevention A newborn must be given prophylaxis, an ARV drug to prevent HIV transmission for babies. Prophylaxis usage depends on the choice of food we plan to give to the baby. Since I plan to breastfeed, my baby will be given prophylaxis during breastfeeding. Mothers with HIV are advised not to breastfeed for more than three to six months. Once the baby starts teething, there are risks of transmission from nipple wounds. If the mother opts for infant formula, the doctor will only give prophylaxis for six weeks. HIV check for your baby This is one step that I am waiting for. The check will be done in three stages. First, when the baby is four weeks old using HIV RNA PCR (viral load tests), second at month six using the same method, and third at month 18 using serological testing. After following every piece of medical advice, I am very optimistic my baby will be healthy and HIV-free. Now my pregnancy has entered its sixth week, and I feel the same way other pregnant women do: nauseated and craving. I am optimistic that living with HIV will not prevent me from having the same happiness as everyone else. *** Ayu Oktariani is a 30-year-old living with HIV, dedicating her life to support others infected with the virus.

Nearly four in 10 US HIV infections from people unaware of infection,"Almost 40 percent of new HIV cases in the US occur because people do not know they are infected, while a similar proportion know but are not in treatment, according to a study released Monday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-03-19,The Jakarta Post,"Almost 40 percent of new HIV cases in the US occur because people do not know they are infected, while a similar proportion know but are not in treatment, according to a study released Monday. The report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is based on 2016 data and aims to bolster a strategy outlined by President Donald Trump to end the epidemic within 10 years. The strategy has two main strands: far more widespread screening, and enabling the infected better access to treatment from the moment they test positive. The study found that 38 percent of infections came from HIV-positive people who were unaware of their status, and 43 percent from people who knew they were infected but took no anti-retroviral drugs. The remaining infections came from people who were receiving HIV treatment but were not yet ""virally suppressed."" The CDC blamed financial, social and other reasons for people not using medication, which these days typically comes in the form of a daily pill with minimal side effects. The study said that the infection rate from the half million people in the United States who take medication and are virally suppressed -- meaning they cannot pass on the disease to others -- was zero. Screening The most at-risk group remains homosexual men, with almost three-quarters of new infections coming from men having sex with men, the report said. Five percent of infections came from intravenous drug abuse among homosexual men, while 10 percent came from injecting drugs among the rest of the population. Twelve percent of infections were among heterosexuals. Overall, the highest rate of transmission was among 13 to 24-year-olds. Read also: Stigma still thwarts HIV prevention The Trump administration has said it will invest $291 million in the next financial year to fight HIV/AIDS, which has plateaued since 2013 to around 39,000 annual transmissions. The goal is to reduce that number by 75 percent within five years and by 90 percent in 10 years. Questioned about the relatively small amount of money earmarked for the multi-billion dollar task of treating HIV carriers, CDC head Robert Redfield said he was ""confident that the resources that are required to accomplish this mission are in the long term plan."" The CDC, based in Atlanta, Georgia, wants doctors to make HIV screening a routine procedure. ""Everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime,"" said Eugene McCray, the head of the CDCs Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. ""Those at higher risk should get tested at least annually,"" he said.

Treatment prevents sexual HIV transmission among gay men: Study,"HIV-suppressing medication can make the AIDS virus ""untransmittable"" even among couples who have sex without using condoms, new research showed Friday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-05-03,The Jakarta Post,"HIV-suppressing medication can make the AIDS virus ""untransmittable"" even among couples who have sex without using condoms, new research showed Friday. The Europe-wide study monitored nearly 1,000 gay male couples over a period of eight years, where one partner was HIV-positive and receiving antiretroviral (ART) treatment, while the other was HIV negative. Doctors did not find a single case of in-couple HIV transmission within that time, raising hopes that widespread ART programs could eventually end new infections. ""Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART is zero,"" said Alison Rodger, from University College London, who co-lead the research published in The Lancet. ""They support the message... that an undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable.

Indonesia turns to Global Fund to ensure ARV stock,"The government says there is enough stock of fixed-dose combination ARV medication that contains tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz in one tablet.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-23,The Jakarta Post,"Amid rising concerns about the availability of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy drugs following a failed drug tender, the government has given assurances that stocks are enough until the end of this year. The Health Ministry’s pharmaceutical and medical devices director general, Engko Sosialine Magdalene, said that although the government had failed to procure the drug, people should not worry because there was enough stock of fixed-dose combination ARV medication that contained tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz (FDC TLE) in one tablet. In December, Engko said the ministry had received a grant of 220,000 bottles of FDE TLE from the Global Fund, an international funding organization that fights AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. One bottle contains 30 tablets, which are enough for one month. “Dont worry and dont panic. Stocks are enough for the next five to six months [...] 220,000 bottles can last until May for users of FDE TLE,” Engko told reporters. The government failed to meet an agreement with state-owned pharmaceutical companies PT Kimia Farma and PT Indofarma, which had been appointed to import the drug, sparking anxiety among users of the drug about the possibility of a looming drug crisis. The drug suppresses the virus and prevents fatal infection. Read also: People with HIV/AIDS face drugs scarcity Engko gave assurances that there would be no drug crisis. She said the ministry was preparing to procure more ARV drugs for distribution after May. “The budget allocation for ARV drugs is ready for 2019. We will try our best, so before May, at least in April, we will have the drugs,” “If there is another delay in procurement, we have prepared an alternative measure in which we will receive a grant of 564,000 bottles [of FDE TLE] from the Global Fund,” she said. Engko also denied there was a scarcity of the drug in several areas. “There is nothing like that. We have a system in place to monitor the availability of drugs in every province. Monitoring in January shows there is no absence of the drug in any region,” she said. FDE TLE is the most commonly used drug among people with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia. According to the Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC), about 48,000 people, or 42 percent of people with HIV/AIDS, rely on FDE TLE. IAC executive director Aditya Wardhana said the Health Ministry had failed to address the main issue behind the unstable drug supply and the failed tender for FDE TLE, which she claimed was caused by Kimia Farma and Indofarma overpricing the drugs. Kimia Farma sources the ARV drug from Indian pharmaceutical company Hetero Drugs while Indofarma purchases from Mylan, which is based in the United States. The IAC has criticized the way the government procures ARV drugs, saying it makes them the most expensive the world. The IAC claims the drugs can be purchased for almost 25 percent less outside Indonesia. “Overpricing the medicine is likely to make the next tender fail, unless the government agrees with the high prices set by the companies,” he said on Tuesday. The budget allocated for ARV treatment has increased every year. In 2017, the Health Ministry allocated Rp 1.19 billion (US$84,673) to fund ARV treatment for 112,054 people with HIV. The allocation increased from Rp 243 million in 2015 and is predicted to reach Rp 1.8 trillion by 2020. Of the ministrys fund allocations for drugs, ARV medication has been allocated the second-highest amount after vaccines.",{},"['global', 'ensure', 'rp', 'arv', 'stock', 'drug', 'fde', 'indonesia', 'failed', 'tle', 'ministry', 'tender', 'drugs', 'turns', 'fund']","Stocks are enough for the next five to six months [...] 220,000 bottles can last until May for users of FDE TLE,” Engko told reporters.

In 2017, the Health Ministry allocated Rp 1.19 billion (US$84,673) to fund ARV treatment for 112,054 people with HIV. Of the ministry's fund allocations for drugs, ARV medication has been allocated the second-highest amount after vaccines.",https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/01/23/indonesia-turns-to-global-fund-to-ensure-arv-stock.html

Papua aims to cut transmission chain of HIV,The Papua administration is stepping up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV by providing antibody tests to pregnant women seeking healthcare services at hospitals or community health centers.,['The Jakarta Post'],2017-08-29,The Jakarta Post,"The Papua administration is stepping up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV by providing antibody tests to pregnant women seeking healthcare services at hospitals or community health centers. By finding pregnant women who test positive for HIV, health authorities can take measures to prevent the transmission of the chronic disease to their babies. “This is one of the ways to cut the HIV transmission chain in Papua,” Papua Health Agency secretary Silwanus Sumule said in a public dialogue in Jayapura on Tuesday. The Health Ministry’s HIV sub-directorate official Triya Novita Dinihari said the government was aiming to achieve the “three zeroes” by 2030, during which Indonesia would see no more new HIV/AIDS infections, AIDS-related deaths or stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (ODHA). Triya said all stakeholders must work together because preventing HIV/AIDS was not the sole responsibility of the Health Ministry. “All societal elements, including religious and traditional leaders and community figures, must be involved. This is because introducing HIV control and prevention in grassroots communities will be effective only if it involves leaders in society,” said Triya. Data shows that 97 percent of HIV infections in Papua have been transmitted via sexual intercourse. Around 16,620, 57.57 percent, of total HIV cases in the province affect people at the productive age of between 25 and 49 years.

Genetically modified rice may help prevent HIV,"Researchers from the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain have teamed up to develop a strain of rice that produces HIV-neutralizing proteins.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-08-04,The Jakarta Post,"For many years now, scientists have been altering genomes of plants and animals to achieve various benefits. Recently, new research has found that genetically modified strains of rice can produce HIV-neutralizing proteins, paving the way to end the HIV epidemic. According to Newsweek, researchers from the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain have teamed up to develop a strain of rice that produces HIV-neutralizing proteins. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published the post-lab report where the group described the techniques they used and how the results could be used to prevent the spread of HIV. “Our paper provides an approach for the durable deployment of anti-HIV agents in the developing world,” the team writes. Infection takes place when the virus interacts with human cells. The transgenic rice produces one antibody and two sugar-biding proteins – the monoclonal antibody 2G12; and the lectins griffithsin and cyanovirin-N – that bind with the HIV virus to prevent further interaction with the human cells. Once the crop has fully grown, the seeds can be ground and processed into a paste that can then be applied to the skin as a topical cream. This will allow the active compounds to enter the body. Read also: Prince Harry joins Elton John to launch HIV campaign targeting men Additionally, the rice seeds can offer an easier platform to produce HIV-preventing medications, as it is cheaper and allows virtually anybody anywhere to have access to the treatment when needed. “Plant-produced pharmaceutical proteins can be scaled up very easily and inexpensively without the need for expensive fermenter facilities simply by planting as many plants as needed to achieve a certain production target,” team leader Paul Christou told Labiotech.eu (https://labiotech.eu/medical/hiv-prevention-transgenic-rice/). “Costs are minimal after the creation of the first plant producing the microbicide. And in our case, the three molecules can be produced in one plant, thus reducing the costs even further.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that a lot of progress has been made in treating HIV. For instance, US citizens have come a long way: in 1985, about 135,000 were infected but the number dropped to 50,000 in 2010. Unfortunately, an effective vaccine has not yet been developed for HIV. Therefore, for now, only oral medications and educating people about the virus have been the best line of defense. In underdeveloped countries however, oral medications are not always available.

In accordance with World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, Ayu shared her thoughts and experience with The Jakarta Post regarding the condition. (kes) How did you feel when you first found out that you were HIV-positive? It happened seven years ago. I was diagnosed HIV-positive while taking care of my late husband. I did not know what to do and what was going to happen. For a year, I became anti-social. I chose not to meet with people, unless it was really necessary. Fortunately, my parents, siblings and some of my close friends have been very supportive. Although, at the same time, I also have encountered some people or other relatives that have kept their distance with me upon finding out about my condition. Did you go to a support group? My doctor and other friends I met in hospital suggested to me to join a support group, but I refused. In 2010, after realizing what my parents had done for me, I decided that it was time to get out. The support group meeting returned me back to the real world. I realized that in this world there are a lot of problems and it is not only about my problem. I begun to accept my health condition and moved on. (Read also: A healthy pregnancy is possible for people with HIV) We heard that you have remarried. Can you tell us more about it? How did you tell your husband about your condition? He was the answer to my prayers. In 2012, I returned to a normal life and started to think about my future. I didn’t want to grow old alone. My husband is HIV-negative. He’s not a HIV activist. In fact, he works in the creative industry. I think it’s positive energy for me [that] he’s coming from a different field. I don’t want to go home [each day] and keep talking about HIV. We got married in 2014. Before taking the big leap, I told him all the consequences of marrying a HIV-positive woman, including the treatment I need to have, the cost and implications of getting pregnant. His family knows about my condition, but we try to keep it to ourselves and not let other relatives find out about this. You moved from Jakarta to Bandung. Did you face any challenges when adapting to this new environment? I had no problems adapting with the new environment. Additionally, the hospital in Bandung has a one-stop service that makes it easier for me. Have you ever encountered friends or acquaintances that were reluctant to share food with you? No. Usually I would be the one who inform them if I have flu or something. (Read also: Most new HIV infections recorded in Jakarta) As a parent, what are the challenges you face?

People are different; some may need a longer time to understand my health issue. Have you ever experienced discrimination in the workplace? In 2009, I worked as an admin for a music school. It ended badly. That was my first [experience of] discrimination I encountered after [they] found out I was HIV-positive. The news spread to the management. After working for nine months, they asked about it. Although HIV can’t be transmitted from social contact, they asked me to resign. In 2010, I undertook work to support HIV-infected people.

Delivering the “Diana, Princess of Wales Lecture on HIV”, a series launched by the National AIDS Trust in Britain in memory of its late patron, the musician recalled when Diana famously shook hands with a man dying of AIDS in 1987 - a time when stigma around HIV/AIDS was widespread. “I am used to putting pressure on pharmaceutical companies, I am used to putting pressure on governments, we have had some success with both,” said John, 71, who has his own AIDS charitable foundation. “The pressure now needs to be applied to the tech giants – not because I think they are bad, but because they have the capacity to do so much good.” John, who sang at Diana’s funeral in 1997, warned how some social media users were hiding behind anonymity to be prejudiced and suggested companies like Facebook or Instagram could “nudge their users in the digital world into acts of positivist and decency and kindness in the physical world”.

HIV infects one teenaged girl every 3 minutes: UN,"Every three minutes, a girl between the ages of 15 and 19 is infected with the virus that causes AIDS, said a UN report Wednesday that warned of a ""crisis"" fuelled by gender inequality.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-07-26,The Jakarta Post,"Every three minutes, a girl between the ages of 15 and 19 is infected with the virus that causes AIDS, said a UN report Wednesday that warned of a ""crisis"" fuelled by gender inequality. Girls and young women made up two-thirds of 15- to 19-year-olds infected with HIV in 2017, according to data unveiled at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Henrietta Fore, head of the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF), referred to it as a ""crisis of health"". ""In most countries, women and girls lack access to information, to services, or even just the power to say no to unsafe sex,"" she said. ""HIV thrives among the most vulnerable and marginalised, leaving teenage girls at the centre of the crisis."" Last year, 130,000 youngsters aged 19 and under died from AIDS, while 430,000 -- almost 50 every hour -- were newly infected, the agency said. While AIDS-related deaths have decreased since 2010 in all other age groups, among older adolescents aged 15 to 19 they have remained stubbornly constant. About 1.2 million 15- to 19-year-olds were living with the immune system-destroying virus in 2017, three in five of them girls, said UNICEF. ""The epidemics spread among adolescent girls is being fuelled by early sex, including with older males, forced sex, powerlessness in negotiating about sex, poverty, and lack of access to confidential counselling and testing services,"" it pointed out. Actress and activist Charlize Theron raised the issue in an address to conference delegates on Tuesday.

""They are the most affected now, across sub-Saharan Africa in particular,"" he told AFP. ""Unless we can reach young people and curb the epidemic among them... then were not going to meet the targets"" of the UN to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. This requires limiting infections to 500,000 per year by 2020, yet last year they numbered 1.8 million.

The closure of the Dolly red-light district in Surabaya by Mayor Tri Rismaharini in June this year is feared to have increased the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in a number of nearby regions. NGO Our Right To Be Independent (Orbit) has revealed that some commercial sex workers operating in cities around Surabaya were former inhabitants of Dolly. We found a sex worker in Krengseng red-light district, near the Tarik district railway station in Sidoarjo regency, for example, who used to work at Dolly, Orbit activist Witanto said on Tuesday. Increasing numbers of commercial sex workers, he said, were also evident in other neighboring regions such as along the Berantas River embankment in Tulungagung regency. According to Orbit Foundations data, increased HIV/AIDS prevalence was also found in Malang, Sidoarjo, Banyuwangi, Mojokerto, Jember, Kediri, Pasuruan and Madiun. Surabaya AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA) secretary Sophiati Sutjahjani, however, said that there was no correlation between the Dolly closure and increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence in a number of cities in East Java. HIV/AIDS can only be detected six to seven years after infection occurs. If many cases have been found now, you cannot say its because of the Dolly closure, Sophiati told The Jakarta Post. An increase in HIV/AIDS cases was also detected in Yogyakarta as the Provincial Health Agency recorded 45 HIV-positive public transportation drivers from 1993 to 2015. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) standard  in which a confirmed HIV-positive person represents 10 unknown cases  then the number of HIV-positive public transportation drivers is predicted to be 450 in Yogyakarta province. People working in the transportation sector are [considered to be at] high risk, the provincial KPA secretary Riswanto said on the sidelines of a seminar on HIV/AIDS in Yogyakarta on Tuesday. In HIV/AIDS mitigation, we talk about the 3M group, or mobile men with money, he added. If men in this category are infected with HIV, there is a chance they will transfer the virus to their respective spouses. Drivers and transportation crew members have to start living a healthy lifestyle and avoiding behavior that risks HIV infection, such as changing sex partners and not using condoms, Riswanto said. Tri Wahyu, a driver of a tourist bus who took a free HIV/AIDS test at the seminar venue said that he wanted to know if he was infected with HIV or not. I once enjoyed sex with women other than my wife, he said. Yogyakarta Health Agency recorded a total of 3,146 HIV-positive cases from 1993 to September this year, of which 1,249 had entered the AIDS phase. Meanwhile in Riau, the provincial health agency together with the local KPA, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) and a number of NGOs held a rally to commemorate Worlds AIDS Day on Tuesday, distributing flowers and ribbons to visitors and passengers at the Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport, Pekanbaru. Riau Health Agency head Andra Sjafril said the campaign was held to remind people to maintain healthy and responsible sexual behavior to avoid HIV/AIDS. The mission is to prevent people from being infected by HIV/AIDS, which still has no cure, Andra said, Tuesday.

"LGBT raids, persecution derail HIV prevention program: HRW","Growing discrimination and persecution against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Indonesia has derailed public health outreach efforts, leading to what Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called a “health crisis”, a report from HRW said Monday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-07-02,The Jakarta Post,"Growing discrimination and persecution against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in Indonesia has derailed public health outreach efforts, leading to what Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called a “health crisis”, a report from HRW said Monday. HRW said Indonesian authorities were “fueling an HIV epidemic” because of their failure to halt arbitrary and unlawful raids by police and Muslim hard-liners on private LGBT gatherings. “The Indonesian government’s failure to address anti-LGBT moral panic is having dire consequences for public health,” said HRW LGBT rights researcher and author of the report Kyle Knight. “The Indonesian government should recognize that its role in abuses against LGBT people is seriously compromising the country’s response to HIV.” HRW released Monday a 70-page report titled “Scared in Public and Now No Privacy: Human Rights and Public Health Impacts of Indonesia’s Anti-LGBT Moral Panic”. The document outlines ""unlawful"" actions against the LGBT people and contains in-depth interviews with victims and witnesses of alleged abuse, health workers and activists. In Indonesia, LGBT people have long been discriminated against, but public persecution, including by authorities, has risen in recent years – in 2016, a poster about LGBT psychological counseling by an organization comprising University of Indonesia students and alumni fueled a heated debate about LGBT rights. Research, Technology and Higher Education Minister Mohamad Nasir responded to the issue by saying that campuses should not admit as students LGBT people. HRW said widespread stigma and “moral panic” against the LGBT community had discouraged some HIV-vulnerable populations from accessing prevention and treatment services. “As a result, HIV rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) have increased five-fold since 2007 from 5 percent to 25 percent. And while the majority of new HIV infections in Indonesia occur through heterosexual transmission, one-third of new infections occur in MSM,” a statement from HRW said.

Teens living with HIV/AIDS on the rise,"The government has been urged to intensify sex education as the number of teenagers living with HIV/AIDS is on the rise in Yogyakarta province, most cases involving male to male sexual relationships",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-06-16,The Jakarta Post,"The government has been urged to intensify sex education as the number of teenagers living with HIV/AIDS is on the rise in Yogyakarta province, most cases involving male to male sexual relationships. Each month an average of three to four teenagers are infected with HIV/AIDS, said Muhammad Zaenal Abidin, head of the Edelweis Polyclinic for HIV/AIDS patients at the Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in Yogyakarta on Monday. Abidin said teenagers identified as HIV/AIDS positive were aged between 15 and 20 years old, and already sexually active. This has been the trend for about four years, a change from the previous trend where those infected by the disease were between the ages of 25 and 49 years old, he added. Zaenal said currently teenagers were more inclined to get involved in a sexual relationship, including those with homosexual orientation, due to the presence of social media, which enables them to easily find partners. Seeking a sexual partner has become very easy, like ordering fried chicken through your smartphone, he said. He believes the education office should be serious and brave enough to provide sex education to teenagers, including conducting campaigns on the use of condoms. Some of the patients who take anti-retroviral medication are still wearing senior high school uniforms. When I asked them, some said they had been sexually active since junior high school, said Zaenal. He added that over the past six months, Edelweis Polyclinic had seen around 30 patients per month, but around 180 people living with HIV/AIDS visit the clinic each month as of the middle of this year. So far, sex education is very deficient as it only concerns anatomy, while discussion of sexual functions remain lacking. If a teenager already has a sex drive, what should he or she do? Lessons on morality are also inadequate, he said. Zaenal added the main cause of HIV/AIDS spreading was no longer the sharing of needles, but sexual contact. Based on data from the Yogyakarta City Health Agency, the number of HIV/AIDS cases totaled 802 last year, an increase from 677 cases the previous year and 561 cases in 2012. The agency said that people living with HIV/AIDS were mostly between 30 and 39 years old (46.9 percent), followed by people under 30 (30 percent) and those from 40 to 49 years old (15.9 percent). Yogyakarta AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA) spokesperson Siti Baruni said the rising number of teenagers with HIV/AIDS was attributed to the condom use campaign in schools being deemed taboo. This is one of the obstacles faced by the Yogyakarta KPA in curbing the HIV/AIDS infection rate. Now, condom advertisements in the media have been limited, as television stations can only air them after 9 p.m., whereas earlier they could be aired anytime, said Siti. HIV/AIDS counselor Nuraini said parents should supervise their childrens social interactions more seriously. A childs surroundings are very influential, for instance a teenager could become homosexual for often being in some environments, or experiencing sexual abuse, she said.

"In Surakarta, speaking about life after HIV",Courageous: Agus says that he became infected with HIV when he was a drug addict,['The Jakarta Post'],2014-12-03,The Jakarta Post,"The 38-year-old said that she found out that she contracted the virus in 2009. I was frustrated for eight days, she said. Eventually, Sutarti found out that her late husband had infected her. All I knew that my husband was sick, was hospitalized and died. I did not know that he was infected by HIV/AIDS. Sutarti has no idea how her husband got infected. His death  and the revelation of her status  were things that she had never prepared for. I was confused. I wondered on how would I pay for my education? For my family and kids? She did not receive a lot of support from those closest to her, despite her mounting tribulations, Sutarti said. Many members of her family, her brothers and sisters and neighbors chose to avoid her after learning of her infection. A lot of people had negative perceptions of me because I had HIV back then. Another former housewife, Islamiyah, told the crowd a story that was much the same. She was also infected by her husband, only finding out that she had contracted HIV after her sick husband was hospitalized. I was shocked and devastated, Islamiyah, who wore a red ribbon to promote awareness of HIV, said. However, the 43-year-old said that she did not blame her husband for what happened to her. I have no grudge and I hold no anger toward my husband. This is probably Gods will, she said. Since Islamiyah found out about her status five years ago, she has regularly participated in a therapy program at Moewardi Hospital in Solo. Like Sutarti, Islamiyah also faced discrimination from her community and her family. Fortunately, my children continue to give me support, she said. As time goes by, those close to Islamiyah began to accept her condition. To help eradicate discrimination against HIV patients, Sutarti and Islamiyah work for NGO Lentera, which provides assistance for those infected by the virus and education programs to stop the spread of the disease. Another HIV sufferer, Agus Badrullah, said that discrimination against HIV patients was still prevalent within the community. For example, nobody wants to use the same utensils we use to eat  despite the fact that doing so cannot transfer the HIV infection. Some doctors even tell us to prepare a good grave once they know our status. This is very ironic, he said. His story differed from the womens. Agus, a drug addict since 1990, found out he was infected in 2006. When I went to Moerwadi Hospital, my HIV status was already at level 4. My eyes were almost blind. I could not breathe, and I was so skinny like an alien, he said. Agus Badrullah said that all he could think about was death, until other people reached out and gave him hope. Fortunately, a lot of activist friends accompanied me and gave me support, he said. Being infected by HIV/AIDS is not the end of everything. He has since benefitted from regular therapy and medication. Most of the estimated 1,400 people diagnosed with the virus in Surakarta are transgendered people, men having sex with men, intravenous drug users, women sex workers and pregnant women, and people with tuberculosis and hepatitis, according to the Surakarta Health Agency. However, only about 500  less than 40 percent  are receiving treatment, according to Tommy Prawoto, the head of the Surakarta office of the National AIDS Commission. Traditional Javanese attitudes towards sex and the stigmatization of those with HIV added to the problem. People living with HIV are embarrassed because of the negative view of society, which leads them to shut down  or even to leave town, Tommy said.

HIV/AIDS positive children left out in cold,"Life has never been easy for children living with HIV/AIDS, a cruel disease that requires costly daily treatments.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-03-02,The Jakarta Post,"Life has never been easy for children living with HIV/AIDS, a cruel disease that requires costly daily treatments. But what makes their lives even more difficult is the fact that neither the government nor the public seem to be willing to help them. In many cases, society only makes their lives harder. Rumah Singgah Lentera, a local NGO that provides protection for 11 HIV/AIDS children in Surakarta, Central Java, said it had been struggling to provide support for the children due to resistance from local residents. Since its establishment in 2012, the organization and children have been forced to move from one location to another after being rejected by local residents. They currently live in a house provided by a local cleric in the Laweyan area. The children, who are aged between 2 to 14 years old and come from Surakarta and several other cities like Salatiga and Boyolali in Central Java and Ngawi in East Java, have been forced to move from one school to another as some parents objected to their presence in fear they would transmit their disease to other students. The Surakarta city administration has offered them housing in the Punggawan area, but the plan has been suspended, again, due to rejection from locals. Meanwhile, Rumah Singgah Lentera has had to work hard to get enough money to support the 11 children. The NGO spends around Rp 10 million (US$750) for children every month. Routine health checks and drugs were covered by the Surakarta administration. Eight children have been registered with the city’s Citizens Health Assistance (BKMKS) program. The remaining three were supported by the Child Social Welfare Program (PKSA), which only gave Rp 1.1 million per child for a year. However, apart from the health services, Lentera has to bear all other costs to look after the children, including food, clothes and education. “Apart from the treatment, we need to fulfill all of the children’s needs on our own with money that we gather among ourselves [the managers] or funds from donor contributions and aid from social agencies,” Lentera manager Puger Mulyono said. Puger, whom the children referred to as ayah (father), said Lentera also needed to bear all the costs when they traveled out of town to pick up HIV/AIDS-positive children who had been cast out from families that were no longer willing to look after them for various reasons. One time, Puger said, Lentera went to pick up an AIDS-positive boy who had been brought by his family to Blitar Social Services in East Java. The latter contacted Lentera because it did not have a service or program to take care of the child, who needed intensive treatment for his illness. “Indonesia has not yet established an agency to take care of children living with HIV/AIDS. Maybe Lentera was the first one to initiate it,” Puger, who co-founded Lentera with his friend Yunus Prasetyo, said. UNICEF child specialist Naning Julianingsih asserted the importance for the government to create an integrated system and services to support children living with HIV/AIDS, since social assistance alone was far from enough, especially when their parents or guardians passed away. “These children cannot go alone to hospitals to access ARV therapy. A system should be established, such as an accessible program that provides intensive treatment to prevent HIV-positive children from becoming AIDS-positive,” she said. She added the government should find solutions for children living with HIV/AIDS to have their rights to health care and education fulfilled, such as providing home-schooling and intensive treatment inside their houses for those unable to go out. Surakarta Mayor FX Hadi “Rudy” Rudyatmo has expressed his unwavering support for the organization and would work to raise public awareness about HIV/ AIDS. “These children need to be taken care of.”",{},"['program', 'surakarta', 'hivaids', 'support', 'positive', 'children', 'treatment', 'social', 'local', 'lentera', 'left', 'cold', 'living']","Life has never been easy for children living with HIV/AIDS, a cruel disease that requires costly daily treatments.

PLWHA walks across country to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS,"Wijianto from Nganjuk, East Java, is pictured with Cirebon AIDS Prevention Commission head Sri Maryati at Cirebon City Hall after giving a lecture at a local university on Monday",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"Wijianto, 30, a person living with HIV/AIDs is on a mission to raise awareness of the conditions and to eliminate the stigma attached to people with the condition by traversing the country on foot. Wijianto, aka Gareng, said on Monday that there was discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Gareng chose to walk to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and on the importance of healthy living. He said he wanted to change the misconception that PLWHA were weak, sickly, useless and no better than garbage. By walking, he wants to show people that PLWHA are healthy and can be beneficial to society. ""I call this mission Cruising the Country on Foot to Promote [awareness of] HIV/AIDS. The purpose is also to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, support other PLWHAs, eliminate the stigma and discrimination against PLWHAs,"" he told kompas.com. Gareng started his journey when he stepped out of his house in Jakarta on Nov. 7 on his 33rd birthday. He walked more than 210 kilometers from Jakarta to Cirebon. During his journey, he passed through several cities in West Java, such as Bogor, Ciawi, Sukabumi, Cianjur, Cimahi, Bandung, Sumedang and Majalengka, before arriving in Cirebon. The Nganjuk, East Java, native will continue his trip on foot as far as the eastern part of the country. He plans to walk through Central Java, East Java, Bali, Makassar, Kendari, Ambon, Manokwari, Halmahera, Gorontalo, Manado, Palu and other areas. Gareng aims to complete his mission after two years in November 2017. He is carrying only clothes, maps, notebooks, medicines and antiretrovial drugs to help his immune system. Everything is kept in a backpack bearing a poster reading ""cruising the country on foot to prevent the spread of HIV and support infected people"". A small Indonesian flag also hangs from his bag. Gareng said he faced many challenges on his mission because many people doubted that he would be able to walk far. However, his strong determination to promote HIV/AIDS prevention so that no one will find themselves in the same position as him keeps him on his feet. His only daughter, he said, was his biggest supporter. ""In 2012, I had my daughter checked by a doctor and she is healthy and [HIV] negative. It raised my spirits and determination to start this long mission,"" he said. Discrimination Gareng told kompas.com that initially he was diagnosed with TB and respiratory problems caused by drugs. The count on his CD4 cells, a type of white blood cells that fight infection, dropped drastically to 24 from the normal range of 500 to1,500. He also had blisters on his body and blood spots on his face, mouth and body. ""At that time I was diagnosed as HIV positive. Nurses should have understood [the illness], but they did not. They seemed to be scared, stayed away from me and even acted disgusted. No one even wanted to accept money from me to buy food,"" he said at the Cirebon AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA) without further details on when he was diagnosed. His wife also gradually became estranged as she was scared of his condition. Putaw addiction Gareng said he worked in a furniture shop in Surabaya in 2002. From there he became involved with people addicted to putaw (low-grade heroin). He refused to try the drug at first but eventually succumbed to the temptation and became addicted. He used it regularly for three years until 2005. ""In 2005, my family learned of my addiction and took me home to be treated,"" he said. During treatment, he suffered sakaw (withdrawal symptoms) until he was gradually cured of his addiction. Gareng then moved to Jakarta to start a new life. He worked as a security officer in 2011. He often worked the night shift, which he says left him vulnerable to lung disease. It was at that time that he was diagnosed as having HIV. Tribunnews.com reported that National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN) head Surya Chandra Surapty said last week that as of June 2015, there were 178,000 people living with HIV and 67,000 AIDS cases in Indonesia.

45 Yogya bus drivers test positive for HIV/AIDS,Self awareness: A bus driver undergoes an HIV test during the celebration of World AIDS Day 2015 in Yogyakarta on Tuesday,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The Yogyakarta Health Agency says that from 1993 to September 2015, 45 bus drivers tested positive for HIV/AIDS in the province. Referring to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, which says that one HIV-positive person represents 10 people, it is calculated that in reality, 450 people in the employment group have the deadly viral infection. ""People who work in the transportation sector are among those with a high risk of at least becoming part of the transmission chain of HIV,"" Yogyakarta AIDS Commission (KPA Yogyakarta) secretary Riswanto said on the sidelines of a seminar on HIV/AIDS control in Yogyakarta on Tuesday. Dozens of bus drivers and civil servants attended the seminar, which was held by the Yogyakarta Transportation, Communication and Informatics Agency. The Transportation Ministry has been appointed as the leading sector in the commemoration of World AIDS Day 2015, which falls on Dec.1. At the event, the Yogyakarta Health Agency offered free HIV tests and 13 men agreed to take the tests voluntarily. ""In tackling the spread of HIV/AIDS, we should recognize people belonging to the 3M group, or Men Mobile with Money,"" said Riswanto. This group has been identified as men who work far from their wives, giving them an opportunity to have sex with people other than their partners. If those men, who frequently work as drivers, seamen or transportation workers, are infected with HIV, there is a chance that they will transmit the disease to their wives or partners. ""Drivers and transportation workers must begin to adopt a healthy lifestyle and avoid behavior with a high risk of getting HIV, such as changing sex partners without using condoms,"" said Riswanto. He said if the drivers and transportation workers had been involved in risky behavior, they needed to immediately take an HIV test. The sooner they knew their HIV status, the better HIV treatment they would receive. GeGe Transport tour bus driver Tri Wahyu said he decided to take the HIV test at the event because he wanted to know whether or not he tested positive for HIV. ""There was a time I repeatedly had sex with women who were not my wife,"" said Wahyu. He explained that most drivers were engaged in behavior with a high risk of getting HIV, such as having sex with commercial sex workers. In doing so many of them used condoms while others chose not to do so. ""Those drivers claim that they have sex with commercial sex workers to heal their stress while some say that they want to try new techniques in having sex,"" said Wahyu. The Yogyakarta administrations assistant secretary for governance and peoples prosperity, Sulistyo, said it was hoped that HIV/AIDS in Yogyakarta and Indonesia could be controlled. He said that medical treatment for an HIV/AIDS infected person was quite costly and this could disrupt the national economy. ""People who test positive for HIV/AIDS will usually have lower productivity,"" said Sulistyo. The Yogyakarta Health Agency recorded that from 1993 to September 2015, 3,146 people tested positive for HIV. Of the total, 1,249 went on to develop AIDS. Around 60 percent people with HIV/AIDS in Yogyakarta are in the productive ages of between 20 and 39 years old.

Photo exhibition raises awareness about children with HIV,"A photography exhibition titled “One Child One Life Projekt” is currently on display at the Kuntskring Art Gallery in Menteng, Central Jakarta, until March 31.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-03-06,The Jakarta Post,"A photography exhibition titled “One Child One Life Projekt” is currently on display at the Kuntskring Art Gallery in Menteng, Central Jakarta, until March 31. Among the events highlights are photographs of and by HIV-positive children, who are or were under the care of Lentera Anak Pelangi (LAP). The event’s organizers stated that the letter ‘k’ in the title represented kids. LAP founder Irwanto said the exhibition aimed to educate the public about the lives of children with HIV and their families. However, it was not expected to portray sadness in their lives. “We want to show that these children are optimistic. But we cannot guarantee that their optimism will last if we do not care about them,” he said.

However, there were issues surrounding the needs of children with HIV, including discrimination. “When we talk about children with AIDS, people automatically think about premarital sex and other things, while actually [what they should focus on is that] these are only children,” he told The Jakarta Post, adding that the issue led to a lack of human resources to help the children. “Our program is among the most well-received because it is aimed at children. The discrimination is less strong, but it still exists.” Read also: Striving for zero discrimination Irwanto also cited a lack of knowledge, neglect from family members and low economic power as other issues in caring for the children. “Another challenge is convincing the children that they always need to take their medicine at a fixed time,” he said. During the exhibition’s opening event on Saturday, Abraham Simatupang, a doctor and volunteer at LAP, stressed the importance of being open with partners. He said that if people with HIV were truthful to their spouses, the rate of mother-to-child transmission could be reduced. “If we are able to detect it early, we can help when the couple plans to have baby. They could have a normal pregnancy and give birth normally to their children,” he said. LAP is a social organization under Atma Jaya University that focuses on providing home-based care for children with HIV from low-income families. It currently provides social and educational assistance, nutritional support, as well as medicine and health care for 97 children in Jakarta and surrounding areas.

Premarital HIV testing: Are we aware of the consequences?,"A new local regulation enforcing mandatory premarital HIV testing has just been endorsed by the Bogor city mayor, Bima Arya Sugiarto",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-02-13,The Jakarta Post,"A new local regulation enforcing mandatory premarital HIV testing has just been endorsed by the Bogor city mayor, Bima Arya Sugiarto. It requires couples who wish to marry to conduct HIV tests to be able to gain their marriage certificates. This regulation comes in the wake of increasing cases of HIV and AIDS in Bogor. Two kinds of HIV testing procedures are approved by the Health Ministry: voluntary counseling and testing and health provider-initiated testing and counseling. Both procedures include counseling and are not mandatory. For the latter service, one can decline to take the offered HIV test. Mandatory premarital HIV testing in Bogor will be the first regulation in Indonesia that obliges people to undergo HIV testing. Mandatory premarital HIV testing has become a controversial requirement for issuing a marriage certificate in many countries, including in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Cambodia. The proponents believe that mandatory HIV testing will protect those who are not yet infected with HIV from their potentially infected partners. Mandatory premarital HIV testing is also hoped to reduce the number of people who engage in risky sexual behavior by indirectly promoting sexual abstinence before marriage. Critics cite human rights concerns such as infringement of the right to privacy, the right to marry and to establish a family. Other critics link the regulation to poor public health consequences, such as a false sense of security among the bridal candidates if they test negative for HIV. An HIV test result is only relevant when the test is conducted. Moreover, a person who gets a negative HIV test result today can still get infected in the future, should he or she engage in unprotected sex with someone infected with HIV or has an unknown status. This false sense of security, combined with ignorance, will make people more vulnerable to HIV infection. Another problem is that in many countries, including Indonesia, HIV and AIDS and the people affected are still subject to stigma and discrimination. Mandatory premarital HIV testing will result in people avoiding the test, as well as preventing people from disclosing their HIV status to others, including future partners, and may lead to people obtaining fake HIV status certificates or opting for non-legal or unregistered marriages. Another impact will be cancelations of marriage proposals as a result of the HIV status of one or both of the bridal candidates. Mandatory premarital HIV testing regulations for bridal candidates potentially harm women more than men. Firstly, if the HIV test results are negative for both bridal candidates, the bride may face difficulties in negotiating safer sex practices within marriage. This will affect her health, including her risk of contracting HIV. Secondly, if the HIV test result of the bride is positive, then she will be more vulnerable to experience violence, discrimination and abandonment from her partner, family, workplace and wider community. Thirdly, if the bride is positive and she is already pregnant, her vulnerability to violence increases, as risk of violence is often higher during pregnancy. Finally, HIV-positive women who are getting married may not necessarily want to disclose their HIV status to their future husband due to fear of wedding cancelation, shame, violence and other discrimination related to her HIV status. The results of a study show that women living with HIV do not have good adherence to HIV treatment when they do not disclose their status, as they have to get their medicine in secret. These situations are counterproductive and prevent women living with HIV from accessing and receiving necessary care, treatment and services, including prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. These potential impacts of mandatory HIV testing contradict the intention of the Bogor mayor and the National HIV program, which aim to minimize new HIV infections and protect the rights and health of people living with HIV and AIDS. Instead of introducing this regulation, more effective steps could be taken, such as promoting HIV testing among the general population (or wider community), including to young people and couples of child-rearing age, together with efforts to step up comprehensive and quality education on HIV. The focus should rather be on increasing access to voluntary counseling and testing services for high-risk groups and the general population; promoting voluntary couple counseling; encouraging people who take voluntary tests to voluntarily disclose their HIV status to their spouses; and ensuring that bridal candidates have access to HIV care, support and treatment services, should one or both test positive for HIV. The mandatory premarital HIV testing regulation should be changed into a regulation offering and encouraging voluntary HIV testing for bridal candidates as part of the standard procedure by the Religious Affairs Office (KUA), which issues marriage certificates for Muslims, or by HIV counselors and health providers. In this case, bridal candidates need a guarantee that their rejection of voluntary HIV testing will not influence further services provided for them. HIV counselors must be better equipped with knowledge around gender, sexuality and violence, as well as skills in couple counseling, violence counseling and HIV disclosure counseling, to encourage people to reveal their HIV status. Access to HIV care, support and treatment services need to be improved and brought closer to the community, including referral services for HIV and AIDS-related cases of violence. __________________ The writer is a researcher at the Atma Jaya HIV AIDS Research Center.

The billion-dollar project “MenStar” will target men living with or at risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been ravaged by AIDS since the 1980s. “The MenStar coalition is bravely tackling the root cause of this problem — the lack of awareness of HIV prevention amongst hard-to-reach young men,” Harry said at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Speaking at the launch, which also featured South African actress Charlize Theron and Ndaba Mandela, the grandson of late President Nelson Mandela, Elton John said: “If we want to end AIDS once and for all, we must make men part of the solution.” Around 36.7 million people around the world have HIV, according to 2016 figures cited by the United Nations’ HIV/AIDS body UNAIDS.

The latest figure compares with 1,500 cases recorded in July last year covering the previous three years. Despite an increase in cases among expatriates, the governments anti-AIDS efforts, particularly free medication, will focus only on Chinese citizens due to limited funding. This was made clear by Wu Zunyou, head of the National Center for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Disease Control and Prevention.

The majority of expatriates with HIV/AIDS are aged between 20 and 45 and at least half of them became infected through heterosexual activities. The second leading cause was intravenous drug use.

"Love and HIV in Wamena, as seen on film",Fighting footage: A tribe in Jayawijaya performs a dance that was later used to dramatic effect in the film,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-06-18,The Jakarta Post,"The dream was there, but now its gone, sings Litius, the protagonist of a new film about HIV/AIDS in Papua. Ukulele in tow, Litius sings of loss, of a future affected by HIV that he feels can never be fulfilled, but in truth, Cinta Dari Wamena (From Wamena with Love) rails against that vision. It is a film of hope and renewal. Supported by the district government of Jayawijaya, Papua; the Australian governments aid agency (AusAID); and the Ford Foundation, Cinta Dari Wamena tries to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS across Indonesia. The movie highlights the need for awareness of what HIV is and how it can be prevented, both for our own health and so we can share that knowledge with our friends and family, said AusAID acting head in Indonesia Mat Kimberley, at the films premiere in Jakarta. In the movie, teenagers Litius (Maximus Itlay), Tembi (Benjamin Lagowan) and Martha (Madonna Marrey) leave their village in Papua and head to the town of Wamena in search of a better education. There, they meet new friends and are exposed to new influences and dangers, the biggest of which is HIV/AIDS. Its no co-incidence the film is set in Papua province. According to UNICEF Indonesia, Papua has a HIV rate almost 15 times higher than the national average. The National AIDS Commission (KPA) says the provinces of Papua and West Papua are experiencing a low-level HIV epidemic. About 30,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV in the provinces today. Nor is it by chance the film focuses on youth. The prevalence of HIV among 15-to-24-year-olds in the two provinces is thought to be even higher than the general population there. All the more reason then, for a film like this to connect with younger generations by hitting the big screens of Indonesia. Directed by Lasja Susatyo, the film keeps it nice and simple. Thankfully, theres no complex plot or attention-grabbing side effects to be had. With a sprinkling of humor, the film rightly focuses on increasing understanding of HIV, debunking some of its myths while warning of the paths that lead to infection. Lasja strikes a good balance. The film shows how HIV is almost entirely spread by unsafe sex in Papua and West Papua, through a combination of prostitution, high levels of unaccompanied men moving around the provinces and the inhibition-busting affects of alcohol consumption. Perceptions of HIV are dealt with too. Early on in the film, the three protagonists watch as an old man is driven away from their village. He has been cursed by God, says a villager. The reality is that the man is being ostracized because he has HIV, attitudes that still prevail in the two provinces and the world over. Shot amid the beautiful Papuan landscape, the film points to how a lack of education and teacher absenteeism in rural areas provide the backdrop for ignorance and myths of HIV to take root. Theres worries about the virus being airborne, theres resistance to testing and to taking subscribed antiretroviral (ARV) drugs  free in Indonesia  that are required to suppress the virus. These drugs have hugely reduced the death rates and suffering of people living with HIV worldwide. At the center of it all is the star-crossed relationship between Litius and the introverted Endah (Amyra Jessica), and their journey toward a truth  terrible and unspeakable at first  that will affect the rest of their lives. The film is currently showing in cinemas across the country, but its success will depend less on cinema ratings than its ability to reach out to audiences that do not have access to the big screen. With the help of local governments, NGOs, schools and universities, there are plans to screen the film and host discussions in Jakarta, Central Java, East Java, South Sulawesi, Papua and West Papua. All profits from the film in theatres will also be donated to Jayawijaya and other districts in Papua to help raise awareness. Despite being released only this month, the films Facebook page already has almost 5,000 likes and a Cinta Dari Wamena movement has even been started on the films website (cintadariwamena.com), which is looking for volunteers to campaign on HIV/AIDS via social media. However, reaching HIV-affected remote areas, particularly in West Papua and Papua, which have little access to technology, will be key if this film is to make serious inroads into complimenting the array of awareness raising work already being taken forward by local authorities, church groups and local and international NGOs in the two provinces. The intention is to take the film to these areas, but in urban settings at least, the film looks set to get people talking about the HIV taboo. Carrying a message of hope that there is life after HIV, the film should help to reduce stigma and resonate with audiences, just like the pangs of Litius ukulele strings.",{},"['love', 'provinces', 'litius', 'hiv', 'papua', 'theres', 'film', 'seen', 'west', 'local', 'indonesia', 'wamena']","'The dream was there, but now it's gone,' sings Litius, the protagonist of a new film about HIV/AIDS in Papua.

Hope abounds for new RI leaders to take firm stance on HIV/AIDS,"In the history of public health, HIV/AIDS has been exceptional -- it has had widespread and long-lasting demographic, social, economic and political impact incomparable to any other health issue",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-10-08,The Jakarta Post,"Under a scholarship from the International AIDS Society (IAS) and with support from the United Nations Joint Program on AIDS (UNAIDS), The Jakarta Posts Rita A. Widiadana attended the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia, to learn more about global progress in HIV/AIDS responses, including in Indonesia. The following are reports from the five-day conference. The recent International AIDS conference, organized by the Geneva-based International AIDS Society and its partners including UNAIDS and the WHO, attracted 13,000 delegate members from around the world and ended with a global chorus of international figures, including former US president Bill Clinton and humanitarian activist and musician Bob Geldof, scientists and civil society groups hoping to end the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030. Such a task will not be easy, however, especially for developing nations like Indonesia, which is facing tremendous public health and social problems. During the five-day conference, Indonesia was in the global spotlight for all the wrong reasons, being named one of the few countries where HIV infection has significantly increased in recent years. HIV/AIDS constitutes a major challenge for Indonesias new leaders, as it is more than a health issue. For Indonesia, the scale of the societal and economic impact of HIV/AIDS could be disastrous, as the disease can reverse a countrys annual economic growth by 1 or 2 percent if it is not properly managed. Economic wealth in the form of gross national product (GNP) could drop in some areas by as much as 40 percent by 2020. Translated to a country like Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia, this is a sum worth billions of dollars, according to a report from an Australian donor agency. While new infections continue to decrease globally, we unfortunately are seeing a very different pattern in several countries in our region, with increasing number of infections in Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines in 2013, explained Sharon Lewin, co-chair of the conference and one of the International AIDS Societys (IAS) team of global researchers. UNAIDS data show there were 35 million people living with HIV worldwide in 2013. Geographically, the majority of people living with HIV have been found in 20 countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa but also in larger middle-income countries such as China, Brazil, India, Russia, Thailand and Indonesia. In the Asia and Pacific region, there were 4.8 million people living with HIV, including 350,000 new HIV infections in the region in 2013. In Indonesia, where the first HIV/AIDS case was discovered in Bali in l987, the number of people living with HIV was estimated at 640,000 by UNAIDS data in 2013. Demographically, in every region in the world, HIV/AIDS shows high prevalence among certain groups, including men having sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), sex workers and their clients, transgender people, prisoners, migrants, pregnant women and their babies. Similarly, in Indonesia, a high incidence of HIV infection among men having sex with men is found in Jakarta (15 to 17 percent) and other big cities. The incidence among intravenous drug users (IDU) is 36.4 percent. In Jayawijaya, Papua, HIV rates among female sex workers are as high as 25 percent, and 18 percent for male sex workers. Around 30.8 percent of waria (transgenders) people in Jakarta are HIV positive. Steve Kraus, UNAIDS Asia and Pacific regional director, told The Jakarta Post: The newly elected leaders of Indonesia must be briefed on the real situation of HIV/AIDS in Indonesia, its current program and the mounting challenges Indonesia is now facing. Michel SidibÃ©, UNAIDS executive director, told the Post that Indonesia had been implementing beneficial and innovative programs in scaling up testing and treatment for people living with HIV in the last two years. The country has optimized all resources  in the fields of policy making, funding, investment and human resources  to give opportunities for people living with HIV to get health access, which has resulted in the identification of new HIV infections, SidibÃ© added. Indonesia is taking dramatic steps to slow the rate of new infections. More recent initiatives aimed at increasing access to testing and treatment are leading the way, added Kraus. Under Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi, Indonesia has been taking progressive and bold action by greatly expanding HIV testing, counseling and treatment services. Early initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) can now be offered to people living with HIV including pregnant women in 10 districts across the countrys 33 provinces. By the end of 2014, the program will be expanded to 72 districts. Indonesia also plans to become one of several countries in the region to offer universal care by 2014, with HIV treatment included in health coverage. Expanding HIV treatment is part of the Indonesian governments drive to meet the Millennium Development Goals and stamp out AIDS, Mboi said. Given Indonesias size and diffusion, a central challenge now will be ensuring that the ministrys directives are implemented at local level. HIV/AIDS activists are also hopeful that the new government will listen to them and work alongside them. Vinolia Wakijo, a prominent defender of transgender people and sex workers in Yogyakarta, said that implementing the AIDS response without involving affected groups would be almost impossible. Bu Naf [Nafsiah Mboi] is a minister who has an open mind and heart as she has invited [transgender people and sex workers], as well as MSM and people injecting drugs, to be part of the solution, Vinolia said. Tono Permana, coordinator of a national network for men who have sex with men and transgender people, applauded the program. Dede Oetomo, founder of Gaya Nusantara, a leading gay rights advocacy group, said he was hoping that president-elect Joko Jokowi Widodo would have an open mind and an innovative program. HIV is more than just a public health threat. It encompasses deep social, cultural and religious stigma and discrimination against the affected people. Jokowi seems willing to listen to peoples needs, Dede said.",{},"['living', 'hivaids', 'international', 'hiv', 'firm', 'sex', 'aids', 'leaders', 'treatment', 'men', 'including', 'indonesia', 'health', 'hope', 'ri', 'abounds', 'stance']","HIV/AIDS constitutes a major challenge for Indonesia's new leaders, as it is more than a health issue.

World awaits effective and affordable HIV/AIDS cure,"Prestigious recognition: Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi (center) poses with members of the Indonesian civil society group, Persaudaraan Korban Napza Indonesia (PKNI) or the Brotherhood for Indonesian Drug Users",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-10-08,The Jakarta Post,"Out of hundreds of sessions held during the 20th International AIDS Conference, a scientific session  Toward HIV Cure  stole the attention of all participants and the world, who watched eagerly for news on effective and affordable cures for HIV/AIDS. We have plenty of data telling us we can make and we have made progress, FranÃ§oise BarrÃ©-Sinnoussi, president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told international journalists. Winner of the Nobel Prize as a co-discoverer of the HIV virus, BarrÃ©-Sinnoussi has been one of the driving forces behind global scientists attempts to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. We will need to collaborate and combine different approaches to HIV  work on cures as well as therapies, prevention and vaccines  and strengthen the relationships between researchers to continue to make progress in tackling HIV. BarrÃ©-Sinoussi said. It is now my duty to get researchers from around the world working together to find better ways to treat and prevent HIV. In the 32 years since scientists discovered HIV, world researchers have gained greater understanding of the its underlying causes, preventions and treatment methods. Since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a shocking report in 1981 describing a rare and horrific illness that caused severe fever, fatigue and weight loss, mostly affecting gay men and killing many of them, scientists have been working toward finding a cure. The search for a HIV cure began when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first treatment option, known as Zidovudine or AZT. When antiretroviral treatment (ART) was unveiled at the 1996 International AIDS Conference in Vancouver, Canada, AIDS was transformed into a treatable and manageable disease. But ART remained expensive. While AIDS became a manageable disease in Western countries, it was still viewed as a death sentence in most developing countries,explained Sharon Lewin, professor of medicine at Monash University in Melbourne and co-chair of AIDS 2014 Conference. The cost of HIV/AIDS treatments is too much for patients in developing countries, averaging at US$25,000 per year per person. ART options for HIV patients were further expanded with the FDAs approval of fusion inhibitors in March 2003 and entry inhibitors in August 2007. Between 2009 and 2010, many ART drug therapies were approved in generic form, making them more affordable and thus more acceptable to HIV/AIDS patients worldwide. In developing countries with mid to high HIV/AIDS incidence, ART remained unattainable, even when costs had dropped to about $10,000 per patient per year in 2000 and to less than $100 by 2010. But the treatment has become simple. In the past, patients with HIV had to consume 20 pills a day. Now patients only have to consume one pill per day, added Lewin. In 2012, IAS launched its global scientific strategy to find a cure for HIV, involving more than 200 of the worlds leading AIDS scientists and researchers. Lewins research was among the most groundbreaking: Traditional antiretroviral [ARV] medications have been able to stop the virus infecting cells, giving patients a greater life expectancy, but the virus remained hiding in their DNA, unable to be found and treated so that patients still had to undergo expensive lifelong ART. By using the cancer drug Vorinostat for two weeks, Lewin and her team were able to rouse the sleeping HIV-infected cells so they could be detected. It was a kind of shock-and-kill the virus. Seeking out the killer virus with doses of a highly toxic cancer drug was a huge step in curing the disease once viewed as incurable. One of the most talked-about studies presented during the conference discussed the viability of such a method. Danish researchers have found a way to activate and expose hidden HIV cells to the immune system  a major step toward finding a cure for the virus affecting 38 million people. Ole SÃ¸gaard, a doctor from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, said a study of six HIV-positive patients showed that a cancer drug, Romidepsin, could kick HIV out of its hiding place and into the bloodstream, where it could theoretically be attacked by the immune system. The finding has been hailed as the single most important advance reported at the AIDS 2014 conference. SÃ¸gaard said while patients immune systems did not destroy the virus, a new trial involving 20 patients would combine this kick approach with an experimental HIV vaccine (Vacc-4x) to see if it could stimulate an immune response strong enough to kill the virus. Steven Deeks, professor of medicine at the University of California, said the Danish research was likely to have a huge impact on HIV research worldwide. Oles data is the first clear evidence, at least to me, that we can truly identify the latent reservoir, the hidden virus, and shock it out of its hiding place, he said. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told conference-goers that a HIV cure may come down to two possibilities  eradicating the virus or driving it so far underground that people dont need therapy, even if the HIV is still lurking somewhere. Fauci further said that an effective cure for HIV would have to have three characteristics: It would have to be simple and easy to administer, with no need for tertiary care; it would have to be at least as safe as the antiretroviral therapy; and it would have to be scalable and affordable enough to treat millions of HIV patients. - JP/Rita A.Widiadana",{},"['effective', 'hivaids', 'virus', 'international', 'affordable', 'hiv', 'patients', 'drug', 'treatment', 'scientists', 'researchers', 'world', 'awaits', 'cure', 'aids']","Out of hundreds of sessions held during the 20th International AIDS Conference, a scientific session ' Toward HIV Cure ' stole the attention of all participants and the world, who watched eagerly for news on effective and affordable cures for HIV/AIDS.

156 housewives live with HIV/AIDS,"HIV/AIDS had infected at least 156 housewives and 31 children aged between 2 and 9 years old in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) between 2001 and July this year, data at the provincial AIDS Mitigation Commission (KPAP) revealed",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-10-31,The Jakarta Post,"HIV/AIDS had infected at least 156 housewives and 31 children aged between 2 and 9 years old in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) between 2001 and July this year, data at the provincial AIDS Mitigation Commission (KPAP) revealed. The data showed that of the 156 infected housewives, 68 were HIV positive while the remaining 88 had AIDS. Head of the KPAP NTB secretariat, Soeharmanto, said that the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in NTB had started to increase in the last five years. This needs to be anticipated as the disease affects not only people of high risk, such as prostitutes and drug users, but also housewives and children, Soeharmanto told The Jakarta Post in Mataram on Wednesday. The same data also revealed that the number of housewives living with HIV/AIDS was higher than that of commercial sex workers, of whom 62 were HIV positive and 12 had AIDS. In total, Soeharmanto said, there had been 912 cases of HIV/AIDS in NTB between 2001 and July 2014, of which 408 were HIV cases and 504 were AIDS cases. Of the 504 cases of AIDS, 216 had died and the remaining 288 were still undergoing medical treatment. Cases of HIV/AIDS in NTB, according to Soeharmanto, were spread evenly in the provinces 10 regencies and municipalities, comprising Mataram and Bima cities and the regencies of West Lombok, Central Lombok, East Lombok, North Lombok, West Sumbawa, Sumbawa, Dompu and Bima. The combined increase of HIV/AIDS cases in NTB is indeed concerning, [...] the known data only accounts for the tip of the iceberg, while many cases are still unknown, he said. Causes of HIV/AIDS, he added, varied from sexual intercourse, to homosexuality, drug use, maternal infection and receiving infected blood. Increases in the number of HIV/AIDS cases were also due to a number of VCT (voluntary counselling and testing) facilities becoming available in Lombok and Sumbawa. Soeharmanto said that KPAP NTB and its partners continued to disseminate information on the need for high-risk groups to have checkups. Yet, the stigma related to the disease prevented them from visiting VCT facilities to have the free medical checkups. Separately, NTB Health Agencys Information and Documentation section head, M.

He said the growing number of cases and the even spread of HIV/AIDS across the province was cause for grave concern. The spread of the disease has reached housewives and children. This is very alarming, he said. NTB, especially Lombok, which is a national tourist destination, he said, had a greater chance of HIV/AIDS spreading due to high mobility from various regions in Indonesia and overseas. Early detection is very important, not only for the health of the concerned person but also to prevent the spread of the disease.

"People living with HIV/AIDS fight addictions, return to work",A 37-year-old grave digger and ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver sat on a bench outside the Gambir community health center in Central Jakarta on Monday after he received methadone medication to help him deal with his addiction to heroin,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-07-06,The Jakarta Post,"A 37-year-old grave digger and ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver sat on a bench outside the Gambir community health center in Central Jakarta on Monday after he received methadone medication to help him deal with his addiction to heroin. He often shared syringes with other IDUs (intravenous drug users) because he did not have enough money to buy a new sterile one. I started using heroin in 2001. I was influenced by my wife and her friends, who were IDUs, said the resident of Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. Then, my IDU friends started to die of illness one after another, he told The Jakarta Post. The death of his friends prompted him to take an HIV test at the health center in 2007. My test results showed that I was infected by HIV/AIDS. Soon after that, my wife took the test and it turned out that she too was also infected by the virus, he said. After he and his wife were diagnosed HIV+, doctors provided them with a regimen of treatment, including antiretrovirals (ARV) and methadone. We have to take ARV pills twice a day to prevent the virus from doing even more damage to our immune system, he said. The methadone, he said, had helped them to recover from their heroin addiction. The therapy has improved my physical health. Now I have enough strength to work and live a productive life, despite my illness, he said, adding that he earns Rp 100,000 (US$10.60) a day. He added that he and his wife were fortunate because they had not passed on the infection to their three children. Data from the National Commission on HIV/AIDS Prevention in 2012 showed that Jakarta was the province with the most incidences of HIV/AIDS, with over 5,000 people in the capital living with the condition. However, out of 44 community health centers in Jakarta, only 19 provide comprehensive treatment for HIV/AIDS including Gambir health center. The head of Gambirs HIV/AIDS unit, I Gede Subagya, said over 100 patients were being treated at the health center. Since 2011, we have provided local residents with comprehensive HIV/AIDS treatment, which includes voluntary counseling and testing, ARV and methadone, he told the Post at his office. Currently we have three trained doctors, one laboratory analyst, one pharmacist and six paramedics in the HIV/AIDS unit, he said.

Local bylaws risk stigmatizing HIV patients,The HIV/AIDS Research Center of Atmajaya University has released a study arguing that HIV patients may be stigmatized by local ordinances requiring them to admit their health status to their partners,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-05-04,The Jakarta Post,"The HIV/AIDS Research Center of Atmajaya University has released a study arguing that HIV patients may be stigmatized by local ordinances requiring them to admit their health status to their partners. The bylaws stipulate that hiding HIV status from partners or spouses can be categorized as a crime, as such concealment is considered to put others health at risk. The center said that such statutes exacerbated the stigma suffered by people living with HIV/AIDS. New HIV infections continue to be detected, meaning that HIV prevention [through the bylaws] has not been effective, center researcher Siradj Okta said on Thursday in a seminar held to discuss the study. The regulations, the center said, would also discourage people from taking HIV tests for fear that they would be forced to confess their status if they were diagnosed as HIV-positive. According to criminal law theory, a person is unlikely to do something if it has legal consequences, Siradj told The Jakarta Post on the sidelines of the seminar. Siradj further warned that the bylaws could in fact lead to increased incidence of HIV infections, which they were intended to reduce. If people were discouraged from taking HIV tests, she argued, they would not realize if they were HIV-positive, increasing the likelihood of their transmitting the virus. Criminalizing those who hide their HIV-positive status is meant to prevent transmission of the virus. However, the HIV virus can be transferred from [many sources]. It is not criminalization that prevents HIV transmission but awareness among infected people, she said, calling for the bylaws to be scrapped in favor of more HIV-awareness campaigns. The problem is that the majority of presumed HIV-positive people are not aware that they are HIV-positive [¦] the HIV virus is mostly transmitted by people who are not aware of their HIV status, Siradj added. According to data the center gathered from the Health Ministry between 2012 and 2013, 80 percent of presumed HIV-positive people are unaware of their status. The study also showed that the bylaws might also worsen the stigma attached to HIV sufferers by criminalizing them for failing to confess their status. HIV-positive people could be seen as criminals because of the statute. They are not criminals, they are victims, Sirajd said. He also said that the responsibility for HIV prevention must not rest solely with HIV sufferers. Precautionary measures are everyones responsibility. I would recommend the bylaws be reviewed. Its better to continue with policies that have been proved to be effective, he said. Sirajd, however, admitted that his research was not ground-evidence-based as most research is. He conducted his research through secondary literature after failing to find a single instance of prosecution under the HIV statute. . He suggested future studies be conducted based on facts on the ground, although he said it would be difficult to find cases given the difficulty of upholding the bylaws. Simplexius Asa, a human rights and HIV activist, concurred with Sirajd, saying that there were currently dozens of similar bylaws in force in local administrations in 34 provinces in Indonesia. Since the first bylaw was issued in the early 2000s, Simplexius said, he had only found one case, in Papua, of the bylaws being upheld.. It is very hard to uphold the bylaws because besides the local administrations lack of professional judges, some accusations in HIV cases are too complicated to be proven, Simplexius said, adding that he agreed that the bylaws should be reviewed.

Most new HIV infections recorded in Jakarta,The Jakarta AIDS Prevention Commission (KPAP) has circulated data showing that Jakarta recorded the highest number of new HIV cases in the country this year,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-11-30,The Jakarta Post,"The Jakarta AIDS Prevention Commission (KPAP) has circulated data showing that Jakarta recorded the highest number of new HIV cases in the country this year. The data, issued by the Health Ministry, revealed that there were 1,075 new cases of HIV infections in the capital as of March. West Java and East Java had the second and third highest number with 1,066 and 871 new HIV cases, respectively. The data also revealed that Jakarta was the city with the third-highest number of new AIDS cases after South Sulawesi and East Kalimantan. The capital recorded 56 cases, while South Sulawesi and East Kalimantan recorded 107 and 102 cases, respectively. The data shows that more residents in Jakarta are well-informed about this issue and therefore become more active in checking their HIV status, KPAP secretary Rohana Manggala said recently. Rohana further explained that the KPAP helped residents in Jakarta to check their HIV/AIDS status by providing free voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) facilities at every community health center (Puskesmas) in 33 districts throughout the capital. The KPAP held the citys third VCT event at St. Carolus Hospital in Salemba, Central Jakarta, last Thursday. The event was part of the VCT program launched in October ahead of World HIV/AIDS Day, which falls on Dec. 1. The event involved around 300 medical personnel and paramedics, as well as representatives from a number of non-governmental organizations. Rohana said that last Thursdays VCT and similar programs on offer at various Puskesmas were ready to test 20,000 Jakartans for HIV/AIDS this year. Based on Health Ministry data, by March of this year, 7,212 people nationwide were infected with HIV, while 595 others had contracted AIDS. Of those infected with HIV, 3,015 were women and 4,197 were men. In addition to the data, Rohana said that during the same period, 136 housewives had contracted AIDS, a number significantly higher than the seven sex workers recorded by the KPAP to have contracted AIDS. Most of the housewives were infected because their husbands often had sex with different partners, including sex workers, said Rohana. She added that housewives were also more prone to HIV/AIDS because, feeling safe with their husbands, they tended to not use condoms. By contrast, most sex workers understood how to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS by using condoms.

Indonesia questions new UNAIDS report,"Indonesian Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi has strongly questioned the validity of a Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) GAP Report released in Geneva on July 16, which categorized Indonesia as a country of concern given its increase in HIV new infections, along with several African countries",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-07-26,The Jakarta Post,"Indonesian Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi has strongly questioned the validity of a Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) GAP Report released in Geneva on July 16, which categorized Indonesia as a country of concern given its increase in HIV new infections, along with several African countries. I was quite confused and shocked when I first read the report on Indonesia. I was wondering where they [UNAIDS researchers] obtained the data, said Mboi in a special interview with The Jakarta Post on the sidelines of the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia. The UNAIDS report said that at the end of 2013, 4.8 million to 5.5 million people were living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. Six countries  China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam  account for more than 90 percent of people living with HIV in the region. According to the report, Indonesia has the third largest number of people living with HIV in the region, with AIDS related deaths increasing and only 8 percent of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The situation in Indonesia sparks a cause of concern, where new HIV infections increased by 48 percent and the countrys share of new infections in the region reached 23 percent, second only to India, the report said. Nafsiah disagreed with the report, saying Indonesia had seen a significant rise in new HIV infections because the country had been intensifying a test and treat program to widely reach the countrys key populations and to give them access to quality testing, treatment and a variety of services. Indonesia has been strongly committed to achieving the MDG [Millennium Development Goal] to end AIDS as public health threat, she noted. In 2012, there were 800,000 people tested and only 26,000 people were HIV positive. This was good for a large country like Indonesia, she said. In 2013, there were more than 1 million people tested. The minister also argued that the report did not portray the reality on the ground. They have to check with us, which figures they were using and what denominators they used for the report. Responding, Michel SidibÃ©, the UNAIDS executive director, told the Post that Indonesia had been implementing good, innovative programs in scaling up the testing and treatment of people at risk of, or living with HIV, during the last two years. The country has optimized all resources  in the fields of policy making, funding, investment and human resources, to give opportunities to people living with HIV there to get health access, which resulted in the identification of a number of new HIV infections, SidibÃ© explained. UNAIDS director for the Asia-Pacific region Steve Kraus said the report might convey a negative assessment and that Indonesia should not be singled out as a bad boy or a bad girl, because of the report.

Candidate AIDS vaccine passes key early test,The near 40-year quest for an AIDS vaccine received a hopeful boost Saturday when scientists announced that a trial drug triggered an immune response in humans and shielded monkeys from infection.,['The Jakarta Post'],2018-07-07,The Jakarta Post,"The near 40-year quest for an AIDS vaccine received a hopeful boost Saturday when scientists announced that a trial drug triggered an immune response in humans and shielded monkeys from infection. Shown to be safe in humans, the candidate vaccine has now advanced to the next phase of the pre-approval trial process, and will be tested in 2,600 women in southern Africa to see whether it prevents HIV infection. While the results so far have been encouraging, the research team and outside experts warn there are no guarantees it will actually work in the next trial phase dubbed HVTN705 or ""Imbokodo"" -- the isiZulu word for ""rock"". ""Although these data are promising, we need to remain cautious,"" study leader Dan Barouch, a Harvard Medical School professor, told AFP. Just because it protected two-thirds of monkeys in a lab trial doesnt mean the drug will protect humans, ""and thus we need to await the results of the... study before we know whether or not this vaccine will protect humans against HIV infection,"" he said. The results of the Imbokodo trial are expected in 2021/22. ""This is only the fifth HIV vaccine concept that will be tested for efficacy in humans in the 35+ year history of the global HIV epidemic,"" added Barouch. Only one so far, RV144, yielded some protection. RV144 was reported in 2009 to reduce the risk of HIV infection among 16,000 Thai volunteers by 31.2 percent -- deemed insufficient for the drug to be pursued. For the latest study, published in The Lancet medical journal, Barouch and a team tested the candidate drug on 393 healthy, HIV-free adults aged 18 to 50 in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States. The participants were randomly given one of seven vaccine combinations or a placebo ""dummy"" alternative. They received four shots each over 48 weeks. Needed badly The study used so-called ""mosaic"" vaccine combinations. These combine pieces of different HIV virus types to elicit an immune response -- when the body attacks intruder germs -- against virus strains from different regions of the world. The vaccine ""induced robust (high levels of) immune responses in humans,"" said Barouch. The tests also showed the vaccine was safe. Five participants reported side-effects such as stomach pain and diarrhoea, dizziness, or back pain. In a separate study, the same vaccine offered complete protection from infection in two-thirds of 72 trial monkeys each given six injections with an HIV-like virus. ""I cannot emphasise how badly we need to have a vaccine... to get rid of HIV in the next generation altogether,"" said Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in South Africa. Approached for comment on the study, which he was not involved in, Venter urged caution. ""We have been here before, with promising candidate vaccines that havent panned out,"" he told AFP. ""This one is novel in many ways so it is exciting, but we have a long way to go."" Could be phenomenal Jean-Daniel Lelievre of Frances Vaccine Research Institute said the vaccine was likely not the ""definitive"" version, but may represent ""a phenomenal advance."" An estimated 37 million people live with HIV/AIDS, according to the World Health Organization. There are about 1.8 million new infections and a million deaths every year. Almost 80 million people are estimated to have been infected since the virus was first diagnosed in the early 1980s. About 35 million have died. A vaccine has proven elusive as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mutates easily and can hide away in cells, evading the immune system, only to reemerge and spread years later. For now, people infected with HIV rely on lifelong virus-suppressing anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to stay healthy. Condoms are still at the frontline of efforts to prevent infection -- mainly through sex and blood contact -- though more and more people use ART as prophylaxis.

Thailand to eliminate mother-child HIV spread,"Thailand has become the first country in Asia to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-06-08,The Jakarta Post,"Thailand has become the first country in Asia to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday. The milestone is another step in Thailands aggressive campaign to reduce new cases of the AIDS virus, but experts warn many other problems still exist — including a rising rate of new HIV infections among gay men and transgender people. The number of babies contracting HIV dropped from more than 3,000 in the late 1990s to 86 in 2015, a figure that was validated to meet WHOs criteria for elimination — mother-to-child transmission rates of less than 2 percent and fewer than 50 new infections in 100,000 births. Cuba became the first country to reach the goal last year. Along with Thailand, Belarus eliminated the mother-to-child spread of HIV and syphilis, Armenia did for HIV and Moldova did for syphilis, the WHO announced Tuesday. Globally, 220,000 new cases of HIV were recorded in babies in 2014, and syphilis caused some 200,000 stillbirths and neonatal deaths in 2012. ""I do think that once Thailand has been able to do it, its a motivation for other countries around the world and also for the public health community because one does see now that, yes, the world can be free of HIV,"" Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHOs Southeast Asia director, said by phone, noting Thailands HIV rate was once among the regions highest. Thailands success comes from strong prenatal care from large cities all the way to the poorest villages. Nearly all pregnant Thai women are screened for HIV, 95 percent of those who test positive are treated to prevent transmission to their babies and almost 100 percent of babies born to HIV-positive mothers are given antiretroviral drugs. However, hundreds of thousands of migrant women, many of them working or seeking menial jobs in Thailand, are not included in the data. Many poor women from neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia do not receive any prenatal care or HIV screening while in Thailand. A 2010 Thai government report found that two to three times more migrant women were infected with HIV in certain areas of the country. There are an estimated 2.7 million registered and undocumented male and female migrant workers in Thailand. They have limited access to the countrys health care system, and many are reluctant to get tested or treated for HIV due to language barriers or out of fear they will lose their jobs or have negative interactions with police or other authority figures, according to UNAIDS. Steve Mills, technical director at nonprofit FHI360s Asia-Pacific office in Bangkok, said this is an area Thailand needs to improve, along with focusing more on at-risk populations such as intravenous drug users and sex workers operating outside of brothels. Gay men and transgender people are of particular concern. ""With the evolution of the epidemic and people being on HIV treatment, its meant that condom use is harder to get to a satisfactory level,"" he said, adding that gay men and transgender people are often harder to reach today because couples often meet through social networks instead of in bars, saunas or other public places where outreach workers once targeted them. ""We need to encourage people to get tested."" Last year, the World Bank published a study calling for more free anonymous testing and treatment among gay men. It said the rate of infection within Bangkok alone had jumped from an estimated 21 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2012. Only one-fifth of those infected were receiving antiretroviral drugs, even though its provided by the government without cost. Thailand was hailed by the international community as a model for other countries after promoting 100 percent condom use among sex workers in brothels in the 1990s, drastically reducing infection rates. But AIDS continues to kill. In 2014, an estimated 20,000 people died from the disease in Thailand, a rate that has remained steady for the past five years. An estimated 450,000 people are living with the virus in the country of 60 million.",{},"['spread', 'workers', 'rate', 'gay', 'hiv', 'men', 'estimated', 'women', 'world', 'thailand', 'eliminate', 'motherchild', 'syphilis']","Thailand has become the first country in Asia to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday.

A fast-track to end the AIDS epidemic,"Home to the third-largest number of people living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia is a country critical to ending the AIDS epidemic in the region and on this World AIDS Day we are at a defining moment",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"Home to the third-largest number of people living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia is a country critical to ending the AIDS epidemic in the region and on this World AIDS Day we are at a defining moment. Only three decades since HIV arrived in this country, we can begin to close the chapter on one of modern historys worst epidemics. In September, Indonesia was one of 193 United Nations member states to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals and commit to ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. This goal is certainly ambitious but it is achievable. Even without a vaccine or a cure, we know how to stop HIV. Indonesia can pride itself on being a pathfinder in the AIDS epidemic on the global stage. In 2013 the Indonesian government launched the Strategic Use of AIDS (SUFA) policy  a pioneering strategy that made antiretroviral treatment available immediately for any person diagnozed with HIV. Providing early treatment has the double advantage of keeping people living with HIV healthy and stopping further transmission of the virus. Last month, the World Health Organization endorsed a similar policy for all countries. The program has now been rolled out in 75 districts. The number of ART sites has more than doubled since 2008 and more than 50 000 people were accessing HIV treatment in 2014, compared with less than 2 500 in 2005. The program is a good indication of how the Indonesian government has sought new and innovative approaches in responding to HIV, and is one of the first in Asia to use treatment as prevention in reducing HIV transmission. At the end of 2014, just a year and a half after the SUFA program was launched, HIV testing has reached slightly more than 1 million people, which is more than five times the number tested in 2010. There has been a massive expansion of prevention services, including condom distribution in key locations and harm reduction programs for people who inject drugs. This scaling up of prevention and treatment services has been possible because of Indonesias investment in its AIDS response and the commitment made to fund HIV treatment for its citizens, which has reached more than US$60 million in 2014. The partnership with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other international partners has also provided very critical support during the early stages of the epidemic. Thanks to the rapid expansion of prevention and treatment programs between 2004 and 2014 nearly half a million new HIV infections have been averted, saving Indonesia billions in treatment costs and avoiding the devastating social, economic and personal impact of the disease on many families and communities. While the country has implemented a pioneering policy on HIV treatment for everyone living with HIV, its treatment coverage is far lower than the global average. If Indonesia is to meet its commitment to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, it needs to urgently intensify and scale-up its HIV response. It is one of 35 countries that UNAIDS has identified as a priority country which must adopt a Fast-Track approach, by front-loading investments and initiating efficient and innovative approaches over the next five years in order to reach critical HIV prevention and treatment targets. Jakarta is at the heart of Indonesias AIDS epidemic, and although it has only 6 percent of the countrys population, Jakarta accounts for almost 17 percent of the total number of people living with HIV living in Indonesia. A month ago the Governor of Jakarta, Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama took the bold step of committing to the UNAIDS fast-track approach by signing the Paris Declaration, which has garnered support from city leaders around the globe. He has also formally instructed the mayors of the five Jakarta municipalities to develop their work plans and budgets in line with the fast-track targets. Jakarta has taken many key measures to promote HIV testing, devoting a month a year to encouraging companies to conduct tests. All city residents can access free HIV testing. Jakarta province is developing a roadmap that will ensure that all its six municipalities allocate resources in a coordinated fashion, setting ambitious targets for testing and treatment, and clear milestones to monitor progress. Time and time again, we have seen that investing in the AIDS response brings huge rewards. Implementing the fast-track strategy in Jakarta and throughout the country carries a big price-tag  more than $500 million over the next five years. At the moment the country shoulders 57 percent of its AIDS budget but as the economy grows, international donors will increasingly withdraw. Indonesia must set out a clear strategy for transitioning to a largely domestically funded response. Provinces and districts will need to assume a greater share of the cost of local responses, and will need to come up with clear plans for mobilizing resources and to already start developing their transition plans, just as Jakarta has begun to do. Of critical importance will be ensuring that the new national health insurance (JKN) covers the cost of the bulk of HIV-related services. There is also scope for making service delivery more cost-effective, both through better integration of HIV services in the health sector and by strengthening coordination between health facilities and community-based organizations (CBOs) on HIV testing, care and support. While funding is a concern, I am even more concerned by the frequent calls by certain religious and public figures to close down brothel complexes in the country. Such action can only undermine existing programs in brothel settings, which we know have been effective in promoting condom use and reducing transmission of HIV. Closing brothels will not stop sex work and will instead create a situation where HIV will find a favorable environment to spread among sex workers and their clients. As we commemorate World AIDS Day, we have a precious window of opportunity to make a difference and build on the foundations which have been put in place during the past 10 years. We have the opportunity to set more ambitious targets for treatment and prevention and invest more domestic resources on the AIDS response just as the Jakarta governor has committed to do. By investing in the AIDS response the government will prevent HIV from impacting hundreds of thousands of lives and ensuring that those already living with HIV can lead healthy, productive lives. These benefits impact not only the individuals concerned but promise a better future for their families and communities as well. _____________________________ The writer is the UN secretary-generals special envoy for AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.

230 Papuans circumcised to curb HIV/AIDS,"The Papua AIDS Eradication Commission (KPAD) has overseen the circumcision of 230 Papuans using PrePex devices, a painless procedure provided by the US-based Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), at Dok II Jayapura Hospital",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-07-07,The Jakarta Post,"The Papua AIDS Eradication Commission (KPAD) has overseen the circumcision of 230 Papuans using PrePex devices, a painless procedure provided by the US-based Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), at Dok II Jayapura Hospital. Of the 253 people who applied for circumcision, 230 had it done. Of the rest, 20 could not proceed because of previously existing penile inserts while the other three had their rings released early due to discomfort, Papua KPAD secretary Constant Karma said in Jayapura on Monday. Karma, who was also among those having the circumcision done, said that the circumcisions were expected to help control the spread of HIV/AIDS. Circumcision, he said, prevented men from contracting many venereal diseases, which were considered a stepping stone in the spread of HIV/AIDS. By lowering the amount of venereal disease, it is expected that the spread of HIV/AIDS will also be slowed, Karma said. He added that the skin on the tip of the penis was where different germs causing venereal diseases might be nesting. Earlier, Karma, a former deputy governor of Papua, revealed that the total number of people infected with AIDS in the province had reached around 19,000 since the virus was first detected in Merauke in 1992. The device, consisting of an elastic ring that gets placed on a males genitals for seven days, has been considered practical and easy to use and can provide a non-surgical, medical means to carry out adult male circumcisions. The modern devices were brought into Papua and West Papua by CHAI and were first used in Indonesia and a number of African countries. The PrePex method is used for men of 15 years of age and older. Before being circumcised, the patients underwent counseling to avoid shock after having the rings attached to their genitals. Charles, one of the participants, said that he could still carry out daily functions after having the rings installed. Although, he said, he felt pain each morning. The pain came when my penis was erect but it disappeared with the erection also, said Charles, adding that during erection the rings exerted more pressure, thus causing pain. Charles also said that two days after the rings were attached, the skin on the tip of his penis began to blacken and on the third day it became septic and odorous. On the seventh day, he said, the skin had dried and was then cut off and the rings were released. Meanwhile, HIV/AIDS counselor Siti Soltief of the Dok II Jayapura Hospital said that after the rings were released, the men were not allowed to have sex within the following six weeks, to allow the cut skin to heal completely. All the circumcision participants have been informed of this and they have all understood and agreed to abide by it, Siti said. After Papua, voluntary circumcision using the PrePex device will also be conducted in Wamena, Jayawijaya, Paniai and Manokwari, in West Papua.

HIV kids repelled from their new home in Surakarta,Illustration,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-08,The Jakarta Post,"A week after the world commemorated World AIDS day on Dec 1, nine children living with HIV have been rejected from their new house in Surakarta, the home-town of President Joko Jokowi Widodo, in central Java. The children were physically unable to enter, nor bring their packing truck to the newly-rented house as the road had been blockaded before they arrived on Monday. Some residents displayed posters illustrating the rejection, proclaiming such statements as; Protect the kids in neighborhood unit (RT) 4, Kedunglumbu aint a HIV kampong and Good men dont make their neighbors worry. We didnt expect that resident antipathy against HIV-sufferers would be this harsh. I cant see the reason behind it because HIV/AIDS awareness programs have been run on a massive scale, explained Yunus Prasetyo, Rumah Singgah Lentera founder, on Tuesday, Dec. 8. The nine children, aged from one to 13 years, initially stayed at a house rented by Lentera in Bumi village, Laweyan district, Surakarta. However, they had to move out as the leasing period had ended and the lessor rejected to extend the lease term due to pressure from local residents. Lentara had managed to lease a new house in Kedunglumbu village, Pasar Kliwon district, Surakarta. However, upon their arrival at the new location, the children and their moving truck were stopped at a barricade that had been made by local residents. Head of neighborhood unit 4 Kedunglumbu, Awud Basbul, admitted that most of the residents rejected the HIV children and neighborhood officials ultimately defended this stance after a vote showed a unanimous result. Three, of 23 residents who joined the meeting agreed to let the children move into the neighborhood while 20 others had rejected their inclusion, he explained. Surakarta acting mayor Budi Suharto acknowledged that the government has missed the opportunity to prevent the expulsion of the HIV children. According to him, the AIDS prevention commission (KPA) had failed in their attempts to illuminate the society with regard to correct HIV/AIDS understanding. If they had succeeded, there would not be such rejections. KPA has been narrowly dealing with medical checks and AIDS prevention, but has yet to handle matters concerning those living with HIV [in society]. We will summon KPA for further explanation. We will not let the children be abandoned, he said. As a temporary solution, he continued, Surakarta municipality would accommodate the children in the Pondok Boro social home, owned and run by the municipality. He called on the public not to discriminate or reject HIV sufferers. Lentera, a non-government organization, provides a social home for children suffering with HIV, to provide them with assistance, counseling, free medical checks and HIV/AIDS awareness programs explained Yunus, further. Discriminate action against these unfortunate children sets a bad precedent for Surakarta, a city which had previously ran campaigns under the guise of being Kota Layak Anak (child friendly city), said Yunus.

Urgent treatment required for Klaten infants infected with HIV,"Nineteen children under the age of 5 years old have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Klaten, Central Java, and now require urgent treatment.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-02-23,The Jakarta Post,"Nineteen children under the age of 5 years old have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Klaten, Central Java, and now require urgent treatment. In the last case, detected in January, a 2-year-old boy was reported to have shown symptoms of HIV since he was 18 months old. “The only possible way a child under 5 can be transmitted the virus is if the mother is HIV-positive during pregnancy and childbirth. Unfortunately, it often happens that antibody screening tests conducted on parents are unable to detect HIV infection,” said Amin Bagus Panuntun, an activist from the National AIDS Commission (KPA) Klaten, on Tuesday. Based on KPA Klaten data, during the period of 2007-2015, 18 children under 5 were indicated to have the HIV virus in their blood. Of them, seven children tested positive for HIV in the middle of 2015. Amin said mother-to-child transmission of HIV could be prevented if it was ascertained early on whether the parents had contracted HIV/AIDS. The problem, he said, was the widespread reluctance to undergo voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for various reasons. As a result, many babies were infected with HIV because their mothers were unaware that they themselves had contracted the virus. “Therefore, starting this year, we will direct all pregnant women in Klaten to take VCT to prevent the transmission of the virus from HIV-infected mothers to children,” said Amin. Meanwhile, he went on, all babies who had tested positive for HIV/AIDS would get treatment from the Klaten Health Agency via hospitals it had appointed to provide antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to slow down the copying of the virus in the body. “Currently, we handle all HIV/AIDS-infected babies. They will receive a continuous supply of ARV drugs,” Klaten Health Agency head Cahyono Widodo said on Tuesday. Over the course of the last nine years, the number of HIV/AIDS cases in Klaten has continued to increase from year to year. Based on KPA Klaten data, 105 people were found to have contracted HIV/AIDS in 2015. They could not, however, be said to be new patients; they were merely recorded as patients last year when they started VCT. In total, the number of HIV/AIDS-infected people in Klaten reached 380 between 2007 to January this year. Of the total, 273 patients are heterosexuals, followed by high-risk people ( 47 ), men who have sex with men ( 26 ), children under 5 ( 19 ), injecting drug users (9), transsexuals (3) and bisexuals (3).

High risk of 'losing control' of AIDS epidemic: Experts,"The AIDS epidemic risks resurging and spiraling out of control unless billions of extra dollars are pumped into prevention and treatment, experts warned Sunday on the eve of a major world conference.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-07-23,The Jakarta Post,"The AIDS epidemic risks resurging and spiraling out of control unless billions of extra dollars are pumped into prevention and treatment, experts warned Sunday on the eve of a major world conference. An alarming rate of new infections, coupled with an exploding population of young people in hard-hit countries, meant the world could be steering for ""a crisis of epic proportions,"" said Mark Dybul, an American AIDS researcher and diplomat. ""Bad things will happen if we dont have more money,"" he told a special event organised a day before some 15,000 delegates attend the opening of the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. The world was ""probably at the highest risk ever of losing control of this epidemic because of demographics and because of countries not paying attention the way they once did, or never did in some cases,"" warned Dybul. UNAIDS last week reported a record number of HIV-positive people using life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ARV), and lower rates of deaths and new infections -- though not low enough according to campaigners. And even this progress risks being overturned. Speakers warned that donor and domestic funding has dropped significantly, and would likely continue declining. Under Donald Trump, the US administration has proposed massive spending cuts, though these have failed to pass through Congress so far. The US is by far the biggest funder of the global AIDS response. Read also: Debunking myths about HIV/AIDS Condoms work! According to UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe, there was a funding gap of almost $7 billion (about six billion euros). ""If we dont pay now we will pay more and more later,"" he told the meeting. Experts lamented that the successful rollout of life-saving, virus-suppressing drugs may have diverted necessary attention, and cash, away from the need to curb new HIV infections. ARVs are also increasing being used, mainly in rich countries, to prevent contracting the virus from sex. To meet the UN goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, infections must be limited to 500,000 per year globally in just two years time. Last years 1.8 million new infections showed that ""unless we did something completely drastic, we will not get anywhere near"" the goal, said Nduku Kilonzo of Kenyas National AIDS Control Council. ""Condoms work!"" she underlined, but only when they are available. Investment in condom distribution has dropped, and less than half the need was being covered, she said. ""We are far, far, far away from our goal of prevention, not just elimination,"" Kilonzo warned. ""We have a crisis and it is a prevention crisis."" David Barr, a senior treatment advocate who is himself HIV positive, agreed that access to drugs, without prevention, ""will not end AIDS"". ""When I last spoke in this conference centre in 1992, I could never have imagined that I would be standing here 26 years later alive and well,"" he told delegates. ""I could never have imagined that 21 million people around the world would be on very effective HIV treatment, I could never have imagined that we will have such effective tools to prevent HIV transmission."" Yet, the success is ""incredibly fragile"", warned Barr. ""We can lose our opportunities and the tools we have created if we fail to use them effectively. If we lose them, then were back to the horror of 1992"" when infections and deaths were skyrocketing.",{},"['far', 'epidemic', 'risk', 'prevention', 'hiv', 'treatment', 'control', 'warned', 'infections', 'world', 'high', 'losing', 'told', 'imagined', 'aids', 'experts']","The AIDS epidemic risks resurging and spiraling out of control unless billions of extra dollars are pumped into prevention and treatment, experts warned Sunday on the eve of a major world conference.

South Tangerang HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation commission manager Muhammad Rusmin said on Saturday that of the 77 new HIV/AIDS cases, 39 were in Ciputat district, with a significance increase of prevalence in the 20-45 age group. The spread of HIV in the municipality has reached a worrying level because the majority of those living with HIV/AIDS are in their most productive years, Rusmin told reporters in North Serpong district, adding that these figures are just the tip of an iceberg because not everyone was willing to be tested. The actual figures are believed to be even more bleak. The commission blamed the spread of the virus on unsafe sex, citing a red-light district in Tegal Rotan and the numerous massage parlors that offered sex as one of their services, all in Ciputat. The commission has recorded an annual increase in the number of sex workers in the municipality of between 300 and 450 in recent years. To curb the spread of the virus, the agency regularly sweeps red-light districts, nets sex workers for a blood test, provides educational programs about sexually transmitted diseases for residents and identifies the areas that are highly prone to the transmission of HIV. The problem were now facing is lack of officers to identify new cases, and we dont have enough volunteers to support people living with HIV/AIDS, he said.

Jakarta launches 'fast track' strategy to combat HIV/AIDS,"The Jakarta administration launched over the weekend a strategy to combat and eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2020, called the Jakarta Fast Track Ending the AIDS Epidemic",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The Jakarta administration launched over the weekend a strategy to combat and eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2020, called the Jakarta Fast Track Ending the AIDS Epidemic. The strategy is part of the worldwide target to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. The head of the health control unit of the Jakarta Health Agency, Widyastuti, said that part of the strategy was to make HIV treatment closer and more accessible to residents through community health centers (Puskesmas). Currently, there are a number of selected Puskesmas that can treat HIV patients with ARV [antiretroviral therapy]. The idea is to bring facilities closer to residents, Widyastuti told reporters during the launch of the campaign at Taman Suropati in Central Jakarta over the weekend. Eleven Puskesmas are able to independently treat HIV patients with ARV, a lifelong treatment that reduces the amount of HIV in ones body and helps boost the immune system. While only 11 independent Puskesmas provide ARV treatment, Widyastuti said that all of the citys Puskesmas provide counseling for residents regarding HIV/AIDS. She said the city administration also had 17 other Puskesmas that serve as satellite clinics to general hospitals that provide ARV treatments with referrals from the hospitals. Furthermore, all of our Puskesmas provide counseling for residents who want to ask anything about HIV or AIDS. Residents can also check their HIV status at the 44 district Puskesmas in addition to the available hospitals, she said. The secretary of the Jakarta chapter of the AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA), Rohana Manggala, said that commemorating World HIV/AIDS Day on Dec. 1 was not just a mere ceremonial event, but meant to increase residents awareness and knowledge of the illness. She added that it was highly important for Jakartans to understand HIV and AIDS, as Jakarta has thus far recorded the highest number of new cases of HIV this year. Data issued by the Health Ministry revealed that there were 1,075 new cases of HIV infections in the capital as of March. West Java and East Java had the second and third highest number with 1,066 and 871 new HIV cases, respectively. During the commemoration of World HIV/AIDS Day, the city administration will encourage residents to check their HIV status and starting on Sunday provided 10 booths where they can check their status for free for three days. Hundreds of residents have lined up to get their blood taken. One visitor, 28-year-old Evan Maulana, said that he drove early in the morning from Kebayoran, South Jakarta, just to take the test. Evan, an ex-drug user, said that he felt obliged to check his HIV status because of his old habits. He said that although he now had a much cleaner lifestyle compared with his younger days, there was still a possibility he had caught the virus while doing drugs. I understand how important it is to check my HIV status, especially for someone who used to be involved in drugs like myself, Evan said. _____________________________________ Hospitals providing ARV Central Jakarta: Tarakan General Hospital, RSCM, St. Carolus, Mintoharjo Navy Hospital, Gatot Subroto Army Hospital, Husada Hospital, Kramat 128 Hospital, Islam Cempaka Putih Hospital.

Thai sergeant with HIV accused of raping dozens of teenage boys: Police,"An HIV-infected Thai sergeant major has been arrested and charged with raping an estimated 75 mostly teenage boys after luring them to meet him in the northeast of the country, a senior law enforcement offical told AFP Thursday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-11-08,The Jakarta Post,"An HIV-infected Thai sergeant major has been arrested and charged with raping an estimated 75 mostly teenage boys after luring them to meet him in the northeast of the country, a senior law enforcement offical told AFP Thursday. The 43-year-old soldier in Khon Kaen province used a false profile on a gay dating app to invite the alleged victims -- who ranged in age from 13 to 18 -- to meet him, said Surachate Hakparn, deputy head of the technology crime task force. Surachate said the teenagers had been cajoled into sharing revealing photos of themselves before arriving and then were blackmailed into having sex with the man once they were there and learned he was not the man in the profile. ""We have evidence that he raped the boys, about 75 of them,"" he said Thursday, adding that the suspect was arrested and charged the day before. ""We have clear evidence of this and he confessed."" The man had allegedly carried out the sexual assaults for four years and authorities were tipped off about the claims via a tip on the Facebook page of the technology crime task forceSurachate added that police believe the scope of the investigation could be even broader and go back years. ""He has done this to boys since he served in Bangkok and continued doing it in Khon Kaen,"" Surachate said, adding that the suspect had been stripped of his rank. In total the suspect faces six charges, including the rape and molestation of underage children. The maximum penalty for child rape is 20 years in jail. HIV testing and counselling services are being provided to alleged victims.

"Rights group, worried about HIV, urges Philippines action","A human rights watchdog says the Philippines is facing one of the fastest growing epidemics of HIV in the Asia Pacific, fueled by government policies that restrict intervention, including access to condom by men who have sex with men.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-12-08,The Jakarta Post,"A human rights watchdog says the Philippines is facing one of the fastest growing epidemics of HIV in the Asia Pacific, fueled by government policies that restrict intervention, including access to condom by men who have sex with men. Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men has increased tenfold in the last five years, but the government has failed to adequately target prevention measures on that population. It said HIV prevention education in Philippine schools is woefully inadequate, commercial marketing of condoms is nonexistent, and barriers to condom access and HIV testing — particularly those below 18 who are required by law to have parental consent— have contributed to the worsening epidemic. The report said the problems found in national and local government policies are compounded by longstanding resistance of the Roman Catholic church to contraceptives. More than 80 percent of Filipinos are Catholic. Peter Mosende, a country officer of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS or UNAIDS, said the Philippines has the highest rate of new HIV infections in the Asia-Pacific region, with new cases increasing by more than 100 percent from 2001 to 2015. The Department of Health said it recorded 38,114 cases of HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, from January 1984 to October 2016 — less than 1 percent of a population of more than 100 million. But the rate of increase has been alarming, with 32,099 of the cases recorded from 2011 to 2016. Officials estimate there could 55,000 cases by the end of 2016. For the first 10 months of this year, 7,756 new HIV cases were recorded. From one new case a day in 2008, today 26 new infections are recorded daily. Beginning in 2010, the transmission trend shifted from male-female sex to male-to-male sex, which this year accounts for 87 percent of new infections, the health department said. More than half of those infected men are 25 to 34 years old, and nearly 30 percent are aged 15 to 24. ""The government had a pretty good track record of fighting HIV-AIDS, but basically they are fighting the last war,"" Phelim Kine, HRW deputy director for asia, said in an interview. ""They are still focusing on female sex workers and their clients when actually the epidemic has changed, but the governments approach is not changing and it needs to or else this will really get out of control."" He said while President Rodrigo Duterte has earned criticism for his bloody war on drugs, government action on the HIV problem is ""something we can reasonably hope for"" given Dutertes expressed support for public health and rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial last week said her department plans to distribute condoms in schools after coordination with the education department and school authorities. She said her office is considering making HIV self-testing kits available to the public. Carlos Conde, HRWs Philippines researcher, welcomed Ubials announcement, but said the government needs to overcome expected opposition from the church, Catholic schools, and parents. The report is based on field research between February and October, and interviews with 82 people across eight cities, including two where officials have prohibited the sale or distribution of condoms and other contraceptives. The research found that young gay men have been subjected to ridicule when they buy condoms from drug stores and have faced stigma when they go to social hygiene clinics that provide free condoms to sex workers. The report recommended abolishing legal restrictions that bar youth under 18 years of age from buying condoms or getting HIV tests without parental consent, better sex education in schools, and imposing penalties on municipalities that refuse to comply with the laws that guarantee the public distribution of contraceptives, including condoms.

Poor awareness hampers AIDS control in West Java,"While facing more frequent exposure to HIV infection, few key populations in West Java get tested for HIV, hampering efforts to tackle the spread of the chronic illness in the province.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-04-06,The Jakarta Post,"While facing more frequent exposure to HIV infection, few key populations in West Java get tested for HIV, hampering efforts to tackle the spread of the chronic illness in the province. Certain groups, such as men who have sex with men, that engage in risky sexual behavior that increases exposure to HIV, make a significant contribution to new cases of the infection in West Java, an official has said. “Only around 13 percent of men who have sex with men have been tested for HIV. The problem is, around 60 percent of them are married so that their wives and children face the potential consequences of becoming infected with the virus,” said West Java chapter National AIDS Commission (KPA) secretary Iman Tejarahmana after a meeting with West Java Deputy Governor Deddy Mizwar in Bandung on Tuesday. With such a phenomenon, Iman said, public awareness to carry out HIV testing had become important. The result of the tests could give the overall picture that all stakeholders, including the government, needed to implement precise HIV/AIDS prevention and control programs, he went on. It is estimated that the number of people at risk of HIV in West Java reaches 1.3 million. Men who have sex with men are among the key populations, which include female commercial sex workers, clients of female sex workers, transgender people, transgender sex worker clients and injecting drug users. (Read also: Most new HIV infections recorded in Jakarta) The Health Ministry says risky sexual behavior, which also occurs in heterosexual relationships, was the highest factor in the transmission of HIV/AIDS in Indonesia at the end of 2016, potentially accounting for 66 percent of cases. From the time it was first detected in 1987 to the second quarter of 2016, there have been 208,920 cases of HIV and 82,556 cases of AIDS in Indonesia, spread over 407 regencies and municipalities across the country. Based on KPA West Java data, the number of HIV cases recorded in the province from 1989 to December 2016 reached 26,422, while AIDS cases amounted to 8,043. According to the data, as of December 2016, West Java ranks fourth out of provinces with the highest number of HIV positive cases after Jakarta, East Java and Papua. Meanwhile of AIDS cases, West Java ranked sixth after East Java, Papua, Jakarta, Bali and Central Java. To increase people’s awareness about HIV testing, the West Java administration is working with AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), an international organization, which supports HIV/ AIDS prevention and control programs in Indonesia. AHF senior vice president Peter Reis said his organization was committed to helping the program via a three-year partnership with the Health Ministry. AHF has allocated Rp 31 billion (US$2.33 million) for HIV/ AIDS programs in four areas, which comprise Jakarta and three regencies in West Java, namely Indramayu, Pangandaran and Purwakarta. Most of the funds are allocated for HIV testing and treatment. Reis hopes the partnership will increase people’s access to HIV/AIDS-related health care services, boost awareness on the importance of early HIV testing and provide quality but affordable HIV medical treatment for all people. “We will link with them programmatically on service delivery for health care,” he said.",{},"['java', 'cases', 'poor', 'hiv', 'sex', 'control', 'men', 'awareness', 'health', 'west', 'hampers', '2016', 'testing', 'aids']","With such a phenomenon, Iman said, public awareness to carry out HIV testing had become important.

However, this is just the tip of the iceberg because many people living with HIV/AIDS are reluctant to open up about their condition, and hence health officials do not have precise data on the scale of the problem, he said.

Foundation promotes voluntary HIV self test,"A non-profit foundation focusing on HIV/AIDS, Live Spirit Family Support, based in Salatiga, Central Java, has been promoting a breakthrough at-home voluntary counseling test (VCT)",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"A non-profit foundation focusing on HIV/AIDS, Live Spirit Family Support, based in Salatiga, Central Java, has been promoting a breakthrough at-home voluntary counseling test (VCT). Foundation founder Andreas Bambang said people were reluctant to come to a clinic for a VCT due to ignorance or negative perceptions about HIV in the community. I am offering to come to their home or having them come to mine in Salatiga for the test, so they can keep their privacy, Andreas said in Ungaran, Semarang regency, on Saturday. Andreas considered the self, at-home HIV test as an alternative because VCT had only been at community health centers (Puskesmas) or hospitals appointed by the government. He said he had been providing at-home VCT services for the last three months to 30 people  all of them tested negative. Andreas, who established the foundation in 2005 after his son was declared HIV positive, used a rapid test method  similar to that used at the Puskesmas  which needed less than an hour for the results. In the service, the test patient is offered counseling prior to the test before having a blood sample taken. The blood test results will be available in 15 minutes and the test taker will be given another counseling session about their HIV status. Andreas suggested that VCT be an obligatory test for the public, even to those deemed less susceptible to HIV contraction. The official data at the Central Java Women Empowerment Child Protection and Family Planning Agency (BP3AKB) showed that from 1993 to 2012 there were 5,301 cases of HIV/AIDS in the province. Of the figure, private sector employees accounted for 20.26 percent at the top rank, followed by housewives with 18.3 percent I hope paramedics and health centers will be prepared to deal with the increasingly massive spread of HIV/AIDS, said Andreas, adding that his foundation aimed to offer the service to at-risk men and gay people in 2015. Noted veteran actor Roy Marten, who has used the foundations VCT service, praised the service. The procedure is not complicated, he said over the phone. He said he was moved to take the test because he had the potential of being infected with HIV. Roy was arrested twice in 2006 and 2007, both relating to drug use, and received sentences totaling to 30 months in prison. In the past, housewives, it was said, could never get infected by HIV. Nowadays, they are vulnerable. This shows that HIV/AIDS can infect anyone, Roy said. By participating in VCT, he added, he could know quickly whether he was HIV positive and could directly get treatment if found positive. Roy expressed hope that people would be more and more aware of the importance of participating in VCT and get rid of the perception that those taking VCT were automatically HIV/AIDS positive. The majority of people with HIV/AIDS get medical treatment only when its too late. They can prevent worsening conditions by knowing their condition much earlier, Roy said.

Developers hope the BioSure HIV Self Test will help identify the estimated 26,000 people in Britain who have HIV but do not yet know. ""Knowing your HIV status is critical and the launch of this product will empower people to discreetly test themselves when it is convenient to them and in a place where they feel comfortable,"" explained BioSure founder Brigette Bard. Early diagnosis reduces the risk of passing the disease on to other people and also raises the success rate of modern treatments, which now make the disease manageable. ""Over 40 percent of people living with HIV are diagnosed late, meaning they have been living with HIV for at least four years,"" said Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT). ""People diagnosed late are 11 times more likely to die in the first year after diagnosis,"" she added. The kit reacts to antibodies -- proteins made in response to the virus -- in a drop of the persons blood, producing two purple lines in the event of a positive diagnosis. The self-test, which is only available via the Internet, can only detect antibodies three months after the patient has become infected, and is not effective during this initial period, and all positive results must be confirmed by professional health workers, experts said. Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive at HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was ""great to see the first self-test kits being approved. ""However, it is important to make sure people can get quick access to support when they get their result."" Currently, those who fear they may have been infected have to collect a blood sample at home and send it to a laboratory, waiting five days for the result. There are almost 110,000 people in Britain living with HIV, which can lead to AIDS if the sufferers immune system becomes badly damaged.

Distributing brochures on HIV/AIDS, they called on people to show respect toward those with HIV/AIDS. People with HIV/AIDS have been subject to discrimination, rally coordinator Azwar Anas said on the sidelines of the rally on Monday. Kudus peer group coordinator Eni Mardiyanti said 14 individuals in 72 recorded cases of HIV/AIDS in the regency had died this year, two of whom were children under five years of age. Calls for an end to discrimination were also voiced by NGO Lentera Asas activists in Semarang city, as they marked World AIDS Day on Monday in the Tugu Muda area by distributing flowers to passersby. 200 activists stage rally calling for respect for those with the disease 14 HIV/AIDS related deaths in Kudus this year, including two children under 5 Difficulties accessing ARV treatment in Gorontalo Lentera Asa director Ari Istiyadi called on the government to provide opportunities for people with HIV/AIDS to work and have decent livelihoods without discrimination. We also call on people not to stigmatize and discriminate against them, Ari said. Semarang City AIDS Commission (KPA) secretary Bambang Soekardjo said that to help improve peoples awareness, the city administration had established so-called AIDS Caring People groups in 47 subdistricts. The administration had also disseminated information regarding symptoms to officials in local offices of the Religious Affairs Ministry, to be passed on to future brides and grooms. As of September this year, Central Java noted 3,767 cases of AIDS and 9,032 cases of HIV, in which 10 percent of AIDS cases were found in teenagers. Nationally, according to data from the Health Ministry, as of September this year, 67 percent of HIV/AIDS transmissions were via heterosexual relationships. In Gorontalo, World AIDS Day was marked with activities ranging from campaigns, the distribution of brochures on the disease and blood donor sessions involving civil servants on Monday. A 33-year-old man with HIV/AIDS who asked for anonymity said he was often stigmatized and discriminated against in his community because of the disease he had. Excommunication happens everywhere, even within my own family, said the man, who had become an activist and member of a HIV/AIDS peer group providing counseling to people with HIV/AIDS. Separately, Gorontalo provincial KPA secretary Irwansyah said people with HIV/AIDS in the province still found it difficult to access antiretroviral (ARV) medication because it was only available at the state-run Aloei Saboe Hospital in Gorontalo city. In fact, people with HIV/AIDS are spread in five regencies and a city in Gorontalo province, said Irwansyah, adding that some lived far from Gorontalo city.

Unfortunately in the article of todays paper they made a gross error by quoting Sophiati Sutjajani saying that HIV/AIDS can only be detected six to seven years after infection occurs. The time of exposure to HIV, contracting the virus and detection with a HIV test is called the window period. Depending on the test this period is two weeks to three months. With the rapid test most people show antibodies within three months. At the time of being infected people can be sick but after that stage, there is a latency period that can last up to 10 years, but can also be a lot shorter, when people dont show any symptoms, but are still contagious. With antiretroviral treatment started as soon as possible after infection, people can have a near to normal lifespan, if they take the drugs daily. Without the drugs, one develops the disease AIDS, and due to a lowered immune system are susceptible to many infections. Without drugs patients die within one year. If readers believe the statement made in the article, they will be complacent and delay getting tested.

Sexually transmitted HIV on the rise in Depok,"The Depok HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA Depok) has revealed an increase in the sexual transmission of HIV, surpassing the use of contaminated syringes as the most common route of transmission in the municipality",['The Jakarta Post'],2013-10-05,The Jakarta Post,"The Depok HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA Depok) has revealed an increase in the sexual transmission of HIV, surpassing the use of contaminated syringes as the most common route of transmission in the municipality. Commission secretary Herry Kuntowo said that sexual transmission was the cause of 62 percent of 188 cases recorded from January to August this year. We have also received reports from activists in HIV/AIDS prevention of 36 new cases and nearly all of them were infected through sexual transmission, he said on Tuesday, adding that many of them were housewives. The commission suspected the absence of a prostitution complex in the municipality had contributed to the situation. The sex workers work sporadically without monitoring or sufficient health education. It is impossible for activists to reach them because the sex workers move around to where the money is such as concerts and outdoor movie screenings, Herry said. He said the commission would establish community groups to support the campaign on HIV/AIDS awareness at district level to curb the transmission. We have better surveillance now because of solid coordination between the administration and activists which has enabled us to detect new cases. However, we fear that the 36 new cases is the tip of the iceberg. That is why we need a program that can reach to the neighborhood unit [RT] level. The commission had been in a hiatus for a couple of years, which disrupted the prevention and medication program for people living with HIV/AIDS. As a consequence many of them had to go to Jakarta for medication while others stopped taking medication altogether. Mayor Nur Mahmudi Ismail of the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), eventually reactivated the commission in the wake of media reports of children with HIV who were being denied access to healthcare at hospitals. The municipality, however, is yet to include people with HIV/AIDS in its free healthcare program. We are still talking to the Depok administration about removing the stigma that HIV/AIDS is a lifestyle disease so that those infected with the virus are somehow undeserving of free medication. How do they explain that to infected housewives and children? Most of whom come from the lower economic brackets, said Radiaz Hages Triandha, activist with the NGO Kuldesak, which holds outreach programs for 45 people living with HIV/AIDS. In dealing with the situation, he said, the organization had to persuade doctors to provide free medication to patients with HIV/AIDS without having to reveal their patients HIV status. Irwansyah from Stigma, another NGO focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, said that the commission had to work fast to name a referral hospital for people with HIV/AIDS. They are reluctant to go to public hospitals in Depok due to discrimination. They prefer going to hospitals in Jakarta or not going at all, he said. Herry said that the commission was still in talks to enable people with HIV/AIDS to get health checks at hospital without being coded to alarm doctors who might refuse to treat them. Not only that, we are still struggling to be allowed by the administration to conduct campaigns on safe sex, he said.

Doctors hope for cure in a 2nd baby born with HIV,"A second American baby born with the AIDS virus may have had her infection put into remission and possibly cured by very early treatment â in this instance, four hours after birth",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-03-06,The Jakarta Post,"A second American baby born with the AIDS virus may have had her infection put into remission and possibly cured by very early treatment  in this instance, four hours after birth. Doctors revealed the case Wednesday at an AIDS conference in Boston. The girl was born in suburban Los Angeles last April, a month after researchers announced the first case from Mississippi. That was a medical first that led doctors worldwide to rethink how fast and hard to treat infants born with HIV, and the California doctors followed that example. In another AIDS-related development, scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of a dozen adults to help them resist HIV. The results give hope that this approach might one day free at least some people from needing medicines to keep HIV under control, a form of cure. That study was published in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine. The Mississippi baby is now 3 1/2 and seems HIV-free despite no treatment for about two years. The Los Angeles baby is still getting AIDS medicines, so the status of her infection is not as clear. A host of sophisticated tests at multiple times suggest the LA baby has completely cleared the virus, said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a Johns Hopkins University physician who led the testing. The babys signs are different from what doctors see in patients whose infections are merely suppressed by successful treatment, she said. ""We dont know if the baby is in remission ... but it looks like that,"" said Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease specialist at Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA who consulted on the girls care. Doctors are cautious about suggesting she has been cured, ""but thats obviously our hope,"" Bryson said. Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies. The Mississippi babys mom received no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor. Doctors started the baby on treatment 30 hours after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was infected. The LA baby was born at Miller Childrens Hospital Long Beach, and ""we knew this mother from a previous pregnancy"" and that she was not taking her HIV medicines, said Dr. Audra Deveikis, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the hospital. The mom was given AIDS drugs during labor to try to prevent transmission of the virus, and Deveikis started the baby on them a few hours after birth. Tests later confirmed she had been infected, but does not appear to be now, nearly a year later. The baby is continuing treatment, is in foster care ""and looking very healthy,"" Bryson said. The Mississippi girl was treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her. Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines. Bryson is one of the leaders of a federally funded study just getting underway to see if very early treatment can cure HIV infection. About 60 babies in the U.S. and other countries will get very aggressive treatment that will be discontinued if tests over a long time, possibly two years, suggest no active infection. ""These kids obviously will be followed very, very closely"" for signs of the virus, said Persaud, who described the LA case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. The study in adults was prompted by an AIDS patient who appears cured after getting a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin from a donor with natural immunity to the virus. Only about 1 percent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection, and researchers have been seeking a more practical way to get similar results. HIV usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface called CCR5. A California company, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes CCR5. Dr. Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania tested it in 12 HIV patients who had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells. The treated cells were infused back into the patients. Four weeks later, half of the patients were temporarily taken off AIDS medicines to see the gene therapys effect. The virus returned in all but one of them; that patient turned out to have one copy of the protective gene. ""We knew that the virus was going to come back in most of the patients,"" but the hope is that the modified cells eventually will outnumber the rest and give the patient a way to control viral levels without medicines, said Dr. Pablo Tebas, one of the Penn researchers. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored the work with Sangamo and Penn. ""The ultimate goal is to create an immune system in the body thats been edited genetically so the cells are not capable of being infected with HIV,"" said director Dr. Anthony Fauci, ""but we are a long way from there at this point."" Jay Johnson, 53, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment more than three years ago. Although the virus rebounded when he temporarily went off HIV medicines, tests show his modified blood cells are still multiplying. ""Hopefully one day Ill be able to say Im HIV negative again,"" he said. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP (**)",{},"['born', 'virus', 'hiv', 'treatment', 'doctors', 'tests', 'cells', 'baby', 'dr', 'hope', '2nd', 'cure', 'aids', 'medicines']","The Los Angeles baby is still getting AIDS medicines, so the status of her infection is not as clear.

Your letters: Pope: There are bigger issues than HIV,"There is no vaccine to prevent HIV and no cure for AIDS, but you can protect yourself from being infected",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-10,The Jakarta Post,"There is no vaccine to prevent HIV and no cure for AIDS, but you can protect yourself from being infected. The only way to prevent HIV is to avoid activities that increase the risk of contracting HIV. Basically, to prevent is always better than to cure. I believe, condoms can reduce the risk of HIV transmission, but not prevent HIV transmission. The website of The National Center for Biotechnology Information explains that the use of latex condoms is recommended for preventing HIV infection. Recent analysis states that the proper use of condoms will reduce the risk of HIV transmission by 60 to 70 percent. While those who consistently use condoms will reduce the risk of transmission by 90 to 95 percent. The figure does not illustrate that the use of condoms makes a person free from the risk of transmission of HIV and AIDS, but prevention is always better, especially for people who often have multiple sexual partners and a higher risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Gregdaru said that, a healthy lifestyle and faithfulness to your spouse indeed prevent HIV spread! But what if your spouse is a person who is infected with HIV since birth? Faithfulness would not be enough. If you do not know the HIV infection status of your spouse, always use a new condom every time you have sex. Condoms are available in various shapes, colors, textures, materials and different flavors. Condoms are available for both men and women. And use a dental dam for oral sex. A dental dam is a piece of cloth made of latex. Heres what to consider when using condoms: 1. Check the expiry date 2. Choose condoms made of latex/polyurethane 3. Keep condoms away from heat and sunlight 4. Use only lubricants that are water based. Avoid using shortening, lotion, petroleum jelly or baby oil because it can break down the condom. (In general, condoms are already lubricated. Lubricants can prevent abrasions that can increase the possibility of infection) 5. Open the condom packaging with hands. Do not use teeth or sharp items 6. Choose a condom with a tip that can hold semen after ejaculation. Put on the condom after Mr. P stiffens and before touching your partners body, and do not let any air get trapped inside it 7. To remove the condom from Mr. P, pull slowly and be careful not to spill the liquid inside 8. Wrap the used condom in tissue and put it in the trash. After disposing of it, do not forget to wash your hands with soap. Maybe that will help you.

When actor Charlie Sheen publicly revealed he was HIV-positive last November 17, 2015, researchers found that there was an uptick in both online searches on HIV and in sales of home-testing kits. What’s striking is that Sheen’s public disclosure increased sales of HIV home-testing kit OraQuick almost eight times more than after long-running awareness campaign World AIDS Day, which has been held every December 1 since 1988. San Diego State University Graduate School of Public Health research professor John W.

Referring to the World Health Organization (WHO) rule of thumb, which says that one identified HIV-positive person represents nine other unidentified ones, it is calculated that in reality, 450 people in the employment group have the deadly viral infection. People who work in the transportation sector are among those with a high risk of at least becoming part of the transmission chain of HIV, Yogyakarta AIDS Commission (KPA Yogyakarta) secretary Riswanto said on the sidelines of a seminar on HIV/AIDS control in Yogyakarta on Tuesday.

Maybe we need an island surrounded by nasty beasts to house all these bad people. Kanti Indonesia can test all they want and toss out numbers all over the place. Until they have a working Public Health Department that can investigate and educate that is all they will have: growing numbers. So, they are testing all these people and finding HIV.

HIV/AIDS program should involve GWL,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Indonesia, especially in West Java, with 42",['The Jakarta Post'],2013-09-13,The Jakarta Post,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Indonesia, especially in West Java, with 42.5 million inhabitants, continues to spread. Bony Wiem Lestari, a researcher at the epidemiology and biostatistics department of Bandungs Padjadjaran Universitys (Unpad) medical school, says that housewives, or women who are currently in the low-risk category, could be at risk in the future. This is due to infection from their spouses, especially now when infection from men who have sex with other men is rising, said Bony in a seminar titled Will HIV-Generalized Epidemic Occur in West Java? at the Unpad medical school in Bandung last Thursday. As an illustration, Bony said 432 people were infected with HIV in 2005, with a further 287 with AIDS. This rose in 2011 to 1,556 people infected with HIV and 892 people with AIDS. Although the number of AIDS cases dropped to 461 in 2012, the number of HIV cases increased to 1,895. Failure to handle the HIV/AIDS cases appropriately, said Bony, could lead to around 90,000 people infected with HIV by 2015. Maximum intervention is required, said Bony, adding that HIV/AIDS prevention programs for the gay, transvestite, and men who have sex with other men (GWL) groups remained inadequate. So far, said Bony, the source of infection was largely from the gay group, contributing to around 50 percent of the cases. Okkeu Supriyadi, an activist from Srikandi Pasundan, a group focusing on GWL communities in Bandung, said his group faced difficulties in carrying out counseling due to limited funds. One of the obstacles in advocating HIV/AIDS issues with the GWL communities, said Okkeu, was peoples lack of awareness. He cited as an example when he took dozens of transvestites to the community health clinic (Puskesmas) to undergo sexually transmitted disease (STD) examinations. Some of the Puskesmas staff had apparently provided a responsible person to attend to a patient. If the appointed person was unavailable, other medical workers refused to treat the patient, said Okkeu. Based on research carried out by Srikandi Pasundan, only 43 percent, or 14,324 members of the gay community and only 45 percent of members of the transvestite community, or 405 people were already familiar with HIV/AIDS information. HIV/AIDS counseling for members of the GWL community, said Okkeu, should be enhanced because data showed that the number of younger members, aged between 15 and 24 years old, of the GWL community was increasing. The increase is between five and 10 people each month in Bandung, said Okkeu. Regarding the prevention of HIV/AIDS, West Java AIDS Prevention Commission secretary Pantja Widi said the issue could be resolved if every level of society was involved in the HIV/AIDS prevention drive. HIV is a community health issue and has turned into a social issue. It is not only the responsibility of people in the health sector, but all of us as a society as well, said Pantja, adding that the spread of HIV knew no boundaries of age, sex or occupation.

"Jakarta lays on free, confidential HIV tests for all",Check up: A medical official takes a blood sample from Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama as part of a program of free HIV/AIDS tests at the City Council in Jakarta on Tuesday,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-10-23,The Jakarta Post,"Seeing an increase in HIV cases in Jakarta, the city administration and the Jakarta chapter of the National AIDS Commission (KPAP Jakarta) are offering free, confidential HIV testing and counseling for a month from Tuesday to Nov. 21. Teams manned by the Jakarta Health Agency and Commission staff as well as relevant NGOs will be deployed to provide a Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) program in public places, including shopping malls, targeting a wider section of the populace in the citys five municipalities. Free tests are already available at Puskesmas (community health centers) and state hospitals for the holders of the Jakarta Health Card (KJS). However, organized tests previously only targeted high-risk groups in red-light districts and drug offenders in prisons. Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama, who is KPAP Jakarta executive chairman, took the test on Tuesday to mark the launch of the program at City Hall. I am willingly taking the test now. Why dont others take it too? he said, calling out to the public and civil servants. Its just like having diabetes. The sooner you know you have it, the easier it will be to be treated. It will turn to a life-threatening condition if HIV develops into AIDS. The number of HIV/AIDS cases has increased over the years. Data from the National Commission on HIV/AIDS Prevention in 2012 showed Jakarta was the province with the most incidences of HIV/AIDS. KPAP Jakarta recorded 20,775 HIV cases in Jakarta in 2012, an increase of 9.3 percent from last years 18,999. Meanwhile, the number of AIDS cases slightly increased from 5,117 in 2011 to 5,118 in 2012. Jakarta Health Agency head Dien Emmawati said most of the new cases were found among non high-risk groups. According to our survey, sexually active heterosexual people topped injecting drug users as having the most potential to be infected, she said. KPAP Jakarta secretary Rohana Manggala said the VCT was intended to break the iceberg phenomenon where only an estimation of 40 percent of HIV cases had been revealed, suspecting that the non high-risk groups, including housewives and children, sat at the bottom of the iceberg. The test aims also to eradicate discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS as the public in general can easily take the test, so people do not think it a curse or a disease of sinners, she said, adding the program would increase the awareness of people toward HIV/AIDS. Rohana said the commission targeted 10,000 people to take the tests in a month and planned to conduct the same program next year. The health agency and the commission would upload the location of the mobile VCT teams at kpapjakarta.org. Dien said the puskesmas also provided the same service for free but providing the service in public spaces would encourage more people to take the test. We use the new HIV screening with Nucleid Acid Testing [NAT] method, which is more accurate, she said, adding the result could be known in only 15 minutes. It costs around Rp 300,000 (US$26.7) to take the test in private hospitals. Dien said the VCT program was also crucial for pregnant women. If the mother is infected, she should take medication to reduce the risk of transferring the virus to the baby. Ahok said the city administration was concerned more about low-income people who engaged in unprotected sex. Middle- and upper-class people are usually aware of the risk of HIV/AIDS, he said. According to the provincial commission, among the HIV-infected are teenagers. However, in its survey revealed last year, only 21.7 percent of those in the 15-24 age group of respondents were well informed about HIV/AIDS and its prevention.

Sexual transmission of HIV on high alert,The Jakarta HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPAP) warned that the increasing sexual transmission of HIV over the past two years was exacerbated by the unpopular use of condoms among people with multiple partners,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The Jakarta HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPAP) warned that the increasing sexual transmission of HIV over the past two years was exacerbated by the unpopular use of condoms among people with multiple partners. John Alubwaman, head of the prevention division at the commission, said it was still difficult for society to accept condoms as there were still many circulating stigmas against the device that could prevent sexually-transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. The stigmas, he said, included the labeling of haram (forbidden in Islam), uncomfortable sex and possible condom leakage. The sexual transmission of HIV is the most crucial issue right now and the only way to prevent it is by using condoms. However, the use of condoms in Jakarta is still very low, he said. The use of condoms in high-risk sex is one of the indicators in the combat against HIV/AIDS in the Millennium Development Goals. Last year, efforts by Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi to distribute free condoms to those who faced the highest risks were hampered by allegations that she would distribute them to teenagers. A group of Muslim groups such as Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, popular Muslim cleric Yusuf Mansur and lawmaker Ribka Tjiptaning, were among those who saw the policy as a slippery slope that could open the gateway to adultery and casual sex in society, especially among the young. In 2012, the cumulative number of HIV infections through heterosexual intercourse cases in Jakarta had reached 637 cases, higher than some 400 cases involving drug users who shared unsterilized syringes, according to the commission. Sexual transmission was also the cause of 62 percent of 188 cases recorded in Depok city from January to August this year. Data from the Health Ministry said the number of HIV cases from April 1987 to 2013 in Jakarta had reached 24,807, while the number of AIDS cases had reached 6,299. KPAP secretary Rohana Manggala said the commission would continue promoting condoms among people with high-risk lifestyles and other efforts to curb the number of HIV/AIDS cases. She said the rising number of people undergoing Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS was a good sign. In October, Deputy Governor Basuki Ahok Tjahaja Purnama encouraged civil servants in Jakarta to take part in the program. People used to silently look for information because they were afraid and suddenly, they died. Nowadays, people flock to have their blood checked, Rohana said, adding the number of VCT participants had reached over 10,000 people as of November.

Midwives to be involved in HIV/AIDS prevention,"In a bid to stem the rising mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Semarang municipality, Central Java, the local administration will enlist the help of midwives",['The Jakarta Post'],2013-04-27,The Jakarta Post,"In a bid to stem the rising mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Semarang municipality, Central Java, the local administration will enlist the help of midwives. According to chairman of the municipal branch of the Indonesian Family Planning Association (PKBI), Dwi Yoga Yulianto, midwives play a vital role in preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. Midwives can reach more women of reproductive age in all levels of society, especially the pregnant ones, Dwi said on the sidelines of a training session held for midwives on pregnant mother reference and HIV/AIDS prevention in women and children in Semarang on Friday. Some 80 percent of expectant mothers, Dwi said, go to midwives for a check-up during their pregnancy. Midwives, he added, were also considered to have a better rapport with patients compared to doctors. More importantly, they deal with more patients from impoverished families that have limited access to health and good understanding of HIV/AIDS. Once involved in HIV/AIDS prevention measures, the midwives will be tasked with monitoring pregnant women for HIV infection. If they observe signs of infection, they will send the woman for a test, he said, referring to the PMTCT program that comprises four activities or prongs. The four prongs include offering all pregnant women HIV tests; providing HIV-positive pregnant women with anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs; selecting the right family-planning program for HIV-positive women and deciding the safest birth methods for HIV-positive pregnant women followed by providing the newborns with the best nutrition. Data at the Semarang municipal health agency show that HIV/AIDS transmission from mother to child accounts for 2.6 percent of the total HIV/AIDS cases reported nationwide. In Semarang itself, during the period of 1995 to 2012, there were 2,351 reported cases of HIV infection and 364 cases of AIDS of which 57 proved fatal. HIV-positive expectant mothers numbered 13 in 2011 and 28 the following year. The move by the municipal administration to involve midwives in HIV/AIDS prevention measures received a warm welcome from Bambang Darmawan, a supervisor with NGO Griya Asa, which has specialized in HIV/AIDS monitoring in the Sunan Kuning red light district in Semarang. Bambang said that prostitutes often got pregnant despite the fact that they were high-risk in terms of HIV transmission. During 2012 alone, he said, 35 commercial sex workers operating in Sunan Kuning were infected with HIV. He also said that the majority of prostitutes went to midwives when they got pregnant. The government, according to Bambang, should conduct PMTCT tests consistently in all high-risk areas such as Yogyakarta, Surabaya (East Java), Batam (Riau Islands), Denpasar (Bali) and Semarang. Unless well handled, the possibility of HIV transmission from HIV-positive expectant mothers is between 24 percent and 45 percent. With early detection, Bambang, said the possibility could be reduced to just 5 percent. Separately head of the training division of the Semarang branch of the Indonesian Midwives Association (IBI), Suprapti, assured that all the associations 500 members in the city had been conducting HIV early-detection programs.

Cambodian on trial for infecting more than 100 with HIV,"Yem Chhrin (center) an unlicensed medical practitioner, is escorted by prison guards at Battambang provencial court, in Battambang province, northwester of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Tuesday",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-10-20,The Jakarta Post,"An unlicensed medical practitioner who infected more than 100 villagers in northwestern Cambodia with HIV by reusing unclean needles went on trial Tuesday, facing three charges including murder, his lawyer said. Yem Chhrin faces up to life in prison if found guilty of murder, intentionally spreading HIV  the virus that causes AIDS  and practicing medicine without a license, his lawyer, Em Sovann, said by telephone from Battambang town, where a provincial court is holding the five-day trial. Yem Chhrin was arrested last December and taken into protective custody, fearing revenge lynching by residents of Roka village, where at least 106 of the 800 people tested were found to be infected with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. Local newspapers have put the number at 300. The infected range in age from 3 to 82, and include Buddhist monks. At least 10 victims are reported to have died. Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world, has inadequate health care facilities, especially in rural areas, where villagers often have no recourse but to rely on unlicensed medical practitioners who have trained themselves to treat minor ailments and to give injections. Yem Chhrin, 53, was one such practitioner. ""I was shocked when I learned I was infected. ... I am sure the HIV virus I had was from Yem Chhrins treatment,"" Leurn Lum, one of the 120 villagers who filed the police complaint, said by telephone. ""I am a good husband, as I have never had sex with other women in my life."" Leurn Lum, 51, said he had never sought treatment from anyone other than Yem Chhrin. He found out he had HIV in late 2014, and his wife had also tested positive. He said he wants to see Yem Chhrin punished. Some villagers said Yem Chhrin had a good reputation for his years of dedicated service to the village by providing treatment even though he lacked formal training or certification. ""Whether it was day or night, whether the patient had money to pay for the treatment or not, Yem Chhrin treated them regardless. I think he was a good neighbor,"" said Chay Savorn, a 60-year-old woman who received treatment from him and was later found to be HIV positive. She said she decided not to join the police complaint even though four other people in her family have been infected with HIV  her daughter, her mother, a 3-year-old granddaughter and a 57-year-old sibling. Em Sovann, the lawyer, said his client has acknowledged reusing syringes for treatment of patients. But he ""has repeatedly said before the police and court officials during pre-trial detention that he had no intention to transmit the deadly virus to any of his patients,"" Em Sovann said. He said he will try to get two of the charges  murder and intentionally spreading HIV  dropped by the court. Yem Chhrins wife, Nhoum Chenda, said her husband never believed that the villagers were infected because of his actions. ""The HIV virus transmitted to those villagers must be from ... something else that we dont know about right now,"" she said by phone. She added that since her husbands arrest, she also had to flee to another province, fearing that angry villagers would kill her. Cambodia had a high HIV prevalence rate of 2.0 percent in 1998, but an aggressive campaign to promote safe sex brought the figure down to an estimated 0.7 percent last year, according to the UN agency that spearheads the worldwide fight against AIDS.",{},"['infected', 'virus', 'infecting', 'chhrin', 'hiv', 'cambodian', 'treatment', 'sovann', 'trial', 'murder', '100', 'villagers', 'yem', 'lawyer']","An unlicensed medical practitioner who infected more than 100 villagers in northwestern Cambodia with HIV by reusing unclean needles went on trial Tuesday, facing three charges including murder, his lawyer said.

HIV prevalence grows among RI teens,"Do as I do: Actress Raline Syah (center) has her blood sample taken for an HIV test during a 2015 World AIDS Day observance in Surapati Square in Central Jakarta, on Sunday",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-11-30,The Jakarta Post,"Indonesia is witnessing a growing rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among adolescents, the most vulnerable population, a UN Asia Pacific report has shown. The report, released by the Asia Pacific Inter-Agency Task Team on Young Key Populations and UNICEF just ahead of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, finds that Indonesia is one of two countries in the region to have seen an increase in the estimated number of new HIV infections among adolescents aged 14 to 19 from 2004 to 2014. The HIV burden among adolescents falls heaviest on 10 countries, namely India, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Cambodia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Pakistan, which together account for 98 percent of adolescents living with HIV in the region, the report said. According to the report, the estimated number of new HIV infections among adolescents in Indonesia stood at 15,000 in 2014, rising from 12,000 in 2004. Besides Indonesia, new HIV infections among those aged 15 to 19 in the Philippines also rose from an estimated 800 in 2010 to 1,210 in 2014 and 1,403 in 2015. Other countries in the region, however, achieved substantial drops in the number of new HIV infections among adolescents. The figure in Vietnam, for instance, dropped to 2,600 in 2014 from 5,900 in 2004, while Myanmars fell to 1,600 in 2014 from 4,300 in 2004. Thailand enjoyed similar success, the rate there decreasing to 1,500 in 2014 from 4,300 in 2004. The Health Ministrys director of disease control and environmental health, Mohammad Subuh, said that while HIV infections in Indonesia were most prevalent among people between the ages of 20 and 49, many in this group may have been infected since adolescence. The incubation period [of HIV] is between five and 10 years. So if someone is diagnosed with HIV when he is 20 years old, he might have been infected since he was 15 years old, Subuh told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. The report also said that individuals in their second decade were more vulnerable to being infected with HIV than adults, and harder to care for after transmission, for a host of biological, social, psychological and legal reasons. Yet they are a much less powerful constituency, often with low visibility and weak voices. To date they have been a neglected component of national HIV testing, treatment, care and support strategies. This inequity needs to be redressed  urgently, the report said. Indonesias number of HIV infections among adolescents defied the global trend. Between 2000 and 2014, the global annual rate of new HIV infections among adolescents aged 15-19 fell substantially, mainly because of the decline in new cases from almost 200,000 to 100,000 in eastern and southern Africa. Meanwhile, the annual number of new HIV cases among adolescents in the entire Asia Pacific region has declined only slightly since 2004. Overall, the number of HIV infections in Indonesia rose to 177,000 in 2015 from 150,296 cases in 2014, according to data from the Health Ministry. But the number mainly rose because there were more people getting tested. So we are currently only seeing the tip of the iceberg, Subuh said. We are targeting HIV prevalence of below 0.5 percent in Indonesia, or around 550,000. So even if the incidence of HIV in Indonesia keeps rising, as long as it is below 550,000, it means it is still under control. Furthermore, the number of deaths from HIV in Indonesia has dropped significantly from 40 percent in 2005 to 0.4 percent in 2015, showing remarkable strides since the advent in 1996 of antiretroviral drugs, which suppress HIV, according to Subuh. Though not a cure, the therapy creates a virtuous circle. The less the virus is in circulation, the less likely it is that people become infected. Since the first case in Indonesia in 1987, HIV has spread to 381 of the nations 498 regencies and cities. Last year, Jakarta, with 32,782 cases, had the highest prevalence of HIV of any province in the country. ------------------- To receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS iTunes, Androids Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsofts Windows Store.

Surakarta reports increasing number of TB patients infected with HIV,"Thirty percent of 120 tuberculosis patients being treated at the Surakarta Community Pulmonary Health Center (BBKPM) are HIV positive, the head of the center said on Friday",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-03-07,The Jakarta Post,"Thirty percent of 120 tuberculosis patients being treated at the Surakarta Community Pulmonary Health Center (BBKPM) are HIV positive, the head of the center said on Friday. BBKPM head Sigit Priohutomo said the figure was found from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) conducted in 2012-2013. The figure has kept increasing since the first VCT was conducted in 2010. During 2010-2011, 20 percent of some 30 TB patients were found to be HIV positive. In 2011-2012, the number of TB patients tested increased to 100 to make the figure more representative. At the time, 400 patients were being treated at the BBKPM, and it was found that 25 percent of the tested patients were HIV positive. The percentage keeps increasing, although the number of patients undergoing VCT examinations has also increased, Sigit said.

Sharon Ruth Lewin: New hope for AIDS cure,(JP/Rita A,['The Jakarta Post'],2014-01-15,The Jakarta Post,"Thirty years ago when people got infected with HIV/AIDS, it was like being hit with a death sentence going through the incredible pain of this vicious condition with no cure available At that time, I treated so many patients with HIV, mostly young gay men in Australia, and I saw them suffering tremendously with HIV-related infections affecting their brains and immune systems with loads of pain, emotion, stigma and discrimination thrown in, remembered Sharon Ruth Lewin. These kinds of situations motivated me to conduct medical research to find ways to ease their pain. Thanks to dedicated scientists around the world, the search for a cure for HIV has made great strides since the discovery of the virus in the early 1980s and today treatment is so efficacious that many people with the virus can live a virtually normal life. Lewin is among one of the foremost groups of these scientists and an active member of the International AIDS Society (IAS), a group currently developing a global scientific strategy for HIV research to end the epidemic that has already claimed 30 million lives worldwide. In January 2013, as a professor of medicine at Monash University and director of the infectious diseases unit at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, she led a team from the hospital to uncover HIVs genetic hiding place and found a drug able to seek it out so that the deadly virus could be destroyed. The research also involved teams from the Burnet Institute, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center and Australias National Association of people living with HIV/AIDS. Traditional antiretroviral [ARV] medications have been able to stop the virus infecting cells, giving patients a greater life expectancy, the professor said on the sidelines of the recent International AIDS Asia Pacific (ICAAP) XI in Bangkok. But, the virus remained hiding in their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), unable to be found and treated so that patients would still have to undergo expensive lifelong ART, she explained Seeking out the killer virus with doses of a highly toxic cancer drug was a huge step in curing the disease, once viewed as incurable, added the professor. By using the cancer drug, Vorinostat, for two weeks, Lewin had been able to rouse sleeping HIV-infected cells so they could be detected. The team of researchers was able to bring the virus to notice in 18 HIV patients in a trial that concluded in January 2013. It was a kind of shock-and-kill the virus, she said. The professor was hoping a new generation of drugs able to kick-start the immune system might now be able to kill the virus. There are more possibilities of getting rid of it by making it visible to drugs and visible to the immune system. The research will take a long time before we can make a final conclusion, she said But, I feel so optimistic and energized. There has been so much progress in HIV/AIDS cure research since I became involved in the global research effort in the very early days of the epidemic, she said, adding that most scientists had seen some light and hope of ending the epidemic. The success of ARV therapy has led many people now to ask whether the world can stop AIDS. ARV drugs and antiretroviral treatments (ART) are now available and affordable around the world, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The treatment has become quite simple. In the past, patients with HIV had to consume 20 pills a day. Now, any patient with HIV will only have to consume one pill per day, explained Lewin. Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and suffering when use is made of a potent ARV regimen, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Widening access to antiretroviral treatments can also reduce HIV transmissions. HIV/AIDS has now turned into a manageable disease. It is no longer seen as a primary death threat. Patients with HIV, especially in their early stages, now have the chance to get wide access to ARV treatments with almost 96 percent life expectancy and will feel less pain. Aside from ART treatments, scientists have also conducted a great deal of groundbreaking research. Several of the milestones in research affected Timothy Brown, also known as the Berlin patient, who was cured of HIV after a bone marrow transplant from a donor with genetic resistance to HIV infection. The two Boston patients  nicknamed for the city where they were treated  also received bone-marrow transplants with cells that were not resistant to HIV. Both of them seemed to be free of the virus for months after stopping treatment. In late December, researchers reported that the virus had recurred in both of the Boston patients. Bone marrow transplants and gene therapy to cure HIV might be too complicated and too expensive, she said. Any research into a HIV cure has always been important, despite the results. This will lead to further research and clinical trials. Finding HIV/AIDS cures and best treatments have always been time and energy consuming, she said. Scientists, she said, needed to inform the public in an honest and measured way what they were working at and the challenges they were facing. I am so passionate and excited that weve reached this stage in the research into a HIV cure. But, the search for an HIV cure has still a long way to go and will require innovation, sustainable funding and political commitments from all parties. Lewins other important step is to become co-chair of the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne next July. The international chair of the conference will be Nobel laureate Professor FranÃ§oise BarrÃ©-Sinoussi, AIDS 2014 International Chair, President of IAS and Director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. The Melbourne conferences theme will be Stepping up the Pace. The theme reflects the significant progress being made in the scientific world toward HIV/AIDS prevention, cure and treatment and the optimism about the falling rates of new HIV infections worldwide. But that is not enough. We have to accelerate the pace to achieve zero AIDS, said Lewin. Stepping up the pace reminds us that, despite the significant scientific gains being reported in many countries, success has not translated into an effective response in many others including notably in many parts of the Asia Pacific region AIDS 2014 is a significant opportunity to mobilize stakeholders and build on the present momentum necessary to change the course of the epidemic for everyone affected, she said.",{},"['able', 'ruth', 'lewin', 'virus', 'arv', 'international', 'hiv', 'patients', 'research', 'treatments', 'hope', 'cure', 'aids', 'sharon']","Bone marrow transplants and gene therapy to cure HIV might be too complicated and too expensive, she said.

Painless circumcision method introduced to curb HIV spread,"The Papua AIDS Eradication Commission (KPAD) began to distribute 1,800 PrePex circumcision devices to residents on Monday in four regions in a bid to reduce the risk of HIV infections in the province",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-06-30,The Jakarta Post,"The Papua AIDS Eradication Commission (KPAD) began to distribute 1,800 PrePex circumcision devices to residents on Monday in four regions in a bid to reduce the risk of HIV infections in the province. The device, made of elastic rings and placed on male genitals for seven days before it is released, has been considered practical and easy to use and can provide a non-surgical, medical means to achieve adult male circumcision. Papua KPAD secretary Constant Karma said that the 1,800 PrePex units, which were donated by the US-based Clinton Foundation through the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), would be distributed to Jayapura, Jayawijaya, Paniai and Manokwari, starting Monday. This is only the first stage. For the second phase, we will receive another 10 million PrePex units [from the foundation], Karma said on Monday on the sidelines of a free circumcision service held to introduce PrePex use at the regional administration-run hospital RSUD Dok II Jayapura. The hospital, according to Karma, would open such a service until Friday. In 2007, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS argued that circumcised men could reduce the risk of HIV infection by approximately 60 percent in high-risk areas. The spread of HIV infections in Papua is alarming, according to the Papua KPAD. HIV in Papua is mainly transmitted through unsafe sexual intercourse. Unlike regular circumcision surgery, PrePex-assisted circumcision is much easier to perform. After the male genitalia is cleaned and measured, anesthesia cream is applied on the tip of it to get rid of a tingling sensation. Then the PrePex, which is a set of two rings, one black and one white, is inserted onto the genitals according to the respective size. The white ring is put inside the genital skin while the black one is put around the outer skin. The rings will clamp the skin, stopping the flow of blood, nerves and nutrition to the skin that will be cut off. As the flow of the blood, nerves and nutrition stops, the skin will automatically feel nothing so that no pain will be felt and no blood will come out, said Suwardi, one of the hospital doctors who assisted in Mondays circumcision service. After the rings are attached, patients could engage in normal activities and then return to the hospital a week later to have the dead skin cut off and the rings released, said Karma, who was also among the patients. Reynold Suwae, a 16-year-old local student completing senior high school in Malang, East Java, was also among the patients. I happened to be on vacation. I am interested to join the KPAD circumcision program because it involves no pain and no blood coming out. The circumcision doesnt disturb my vacation, Reynold said.

World AIDS Day interview: It's still taboo to talk about sex in Indonesia,Ayu Oktariani,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"In connection to World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, TheJakartaPost.coms Anton Hermansyah sat down with Indonesia AIDS Coalition campaigner Ayu Oktariani, who is also an HIV infected activist, to talk about AIDS education in Indonesia and HIV awareness. Ayu was diagnosed with HIV and hepatitis C in 2009. She was infected by her late husband, an intravenous drug user. As a mother of a healthy daughter, she realized that she had to get past the emotional turmoil and move on. She eventually became an activist for awareness on both HIV and hepatitis C. She was a finalist in the 2014 Kartini Next Generation Awards. Her campaigning of the health minister through change.org was success in making PT Roche Indonesia lower the price of the drug pegylated interferon, on which it held the patent, to make it more affordable. Question: How much HIV/AIDS awareness is there in Indonesia? Answer: In my opinion, after 2012, HIV awareness improved because there was more information. But the incidence of infection is not decreasing. Even though awareness has increased, so too has the infection rate. The stigma attached to HIV is still prevalent here. What facts about the condition are not widely known among the public? Many people dont realize how the virus is transmitted. Some dont even know exactly what HIV is. They know its a deadly virus, like a curse. They just learn about it from mouth to mouth, which deviates a lot. If they are asked about it, they just answer based on their own perception, which is wrong. HIV is a virus that attacks the bodys immune system, period. From the beginning, the public understood that it had widely spread but they didnt understand the ways that it could spread (including through unprotected sex, childbirth and needle sharing). From the ways it can be spread, which is the most common? In recent three years it has been sexual intercourse, especially between heterogeneous couples -- from man to woman and vice versa. Prior to 2012, it was intravenous drug use. Infection among homosexual couples was also high. Recently, it is coming from heterogeneous couples and from mom to baby. What is the main hurdle in HIV/AIDS education in Indonesia? Indonesians have been conditioned to think that talking about sex is taboo. They just know that it is wrong to have sex outside of marriage. But we cannot control incidences of sex outside the home. It can happen between students, teacher and student, and siblings. Safe sex education that should be given to teenagers at an early stage cannot be done as schools reject the idea. They claim that educating students about sex and condoms is the same as condoning casual sex. But we cannot ignore the fact that casual sex between teenagers happens. I dont have the number, but there are plenty of cases revealed in the news and social media. If casual sex cannot be prevented, we could at least suggest that it be practiced safely. How should people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) be treated? According to the community, they dont want special treatment. We can eat, we dont need help walking, they say. It is wrong to treat PLWHA any differently from other people. PLWHA still face stigma. They are considered sick people with a contagious disease, sinners. Even the terminology used by the government is wrong. They are referred to as sufferers. It is wrong to depict PLWHA as people who suffer. Right now my team is struggling to promote the use of PLWHA instead of sufferer. Images in advertisements on TV or in magazines always give a negative image, someone who is sick and sad. It can be seen in AIDS Day advertisements. We also have inspirational figures, people who have successfully self-medicated, HIV-positive women who have uninfected babies. The ads aim to make people pity us and nothing more. We should make smarter public communication. What about medication? Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are now widely available in Indonesia, but not as much as in Europe or the US as brands here are limited. But PLWHA can get it freely in the hospital. If you are infected you can go to a referral hospital or public health center (Puskesmas). A list of places is available at the Health Ministry or you can ask around the communities. What one needs to pay for is just supporting health tests, such as blood tests or treatment for any accompanying infections. Medication is mostly free and easily accessed. It is available throughout Indonesia. How is the quality of medical treatment? Every reference hospital has a working group (Pokja) that is well trained. But I cannot not deny that there have been cases in which the doctor or nurse still use incorrect terms or make discriminatory remarks, but they are individual cases. An example of discrimination, like the use of sufferer, is the way of discriminatively looking at the background of PLWHAs. There is a tendency to discriminate against people having an HIV test. Like the people who contracted it through jajan (sex with a prostitute) or prostitutes themselves. These people are usually discriminated against or judged as deviants by hospital staff. Also people who have difficulty getting recognition, such as lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT). When I tested positive, why couldnt they just treat me without judging my background? But those are just minor cases; there are hospitals and Puskesmas with excellent services. Do people know that an infected woman can deliver a healthy baby? The thirst for information is lacking, even with my mother and among the people around me. Except among those who are close to the community and people participating in the Caring Citizens movement or Puskesmas activists. In future, what should be included in HIV awareness campaigns and what can the media do? The dissemination of information on HIV has been carried out for 30 years, which is not a short period of time. Progress is slow, but I cant say it has failed. I and other activists try to fill the gap and not limit ourselves to the communities but also engage the public. The media could turn bad news into good news. I often research what topics the media focuses on regarding HIV and most media outlets just care about the numbers. How many are infected, how many women are infected and the number of LGBT infected. It is sexist, but maybe it is aimed at spicing up a story to make people read it, I dont know. I wish there were more smart media outlets that focused on the success of the programs. Ones that would run articles on how to protect yourself and how to treat PLWHAs; ones that dont intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against PLWHAs. For example, there are a lot of infected women who can deliver a healthy baby and married PLWHA with an uninfected spouse who remains healthy. Can you give us a brief rundown on the data? I dont remember the exactly figures, but the Health Ministry presently estimates HIV cases at 500,000 to 600,000, but actual reported cases are just 150,000. There are people who get infected but dont want to be tested or take medication. The Health Ministry releases data on HIV every three months, so the figures are current.

Search for HIV vaccine resumes with test in South Africa,"The latest attempt in the long, frustrating search for a vaccine against HIV began in South Africa on Wednesday, as scientists test a beefed-up version of the only shot ever to show a glimmer of protection.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The latest attempt in the long, frustrating search for a vaccine against HIV began in South Africa on Wednesday, as scientists test a beefed-up version of the only shot ever to show a glimmer of protection. The stakes are high. Its the first study of its kind begun in seven years, and even moderate success could prove important not only in hard-hit South Africa, where more than 1,000 people a day are infected with HIV, but beyond. ""If an HIV vaccine were found to work in South Africa, it could dramatically alter the course of the pandemic,"" Glenda Gray, president of the South African Medical Research Council, said Wednesday at one of the test clinics in Soshanguve township outside Pretoria. The council is helping run the study. Developing a vaccine against the virus that causes AIDS is one of sciences greatest challenges, and the field is littered with failures. Better medications have greatly improved survival for many people, turning the virus into a chronic disease rather than a quick killer. But there is no cure, and there still are a million AIDS-related deaths a year. The new study is based on the only vaccine attempt ever to show even marginal effectiveness, in Thailand in 2009 — a two-vaccine combination that cut the risk of HIV infection by 31 percent over 3½ years. That wasnt nearly effective enough to use outside of research, but scientists immediately started trying to modify and improve that combination. A small safety test in South Africa earlier this year showed that the modified vaccine combo was promising enough for a major study to probe if it really works. The new vaccine aims to provide ""greater and more sustained protection,"" Mookho Malahleha, a researcher involved in the project who was at the Soshanguve clinic. The new study, funded in part by the US governments National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will enroll 5,400 sexually active men and women between 18 and 35 at sites across South Africa. Volunteers for the study will be randomly assigned to receive either five vaccine injections over a year or five placebo shots. Results are expected in 2020. Participants who become infected with HIV will be referred to local medical providers for care and treatment and will be counseled on how to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus. People cannot be infected through the vaccine. The vaccine combination consists of two experimental shots — ALVAC-HIV supplied by drug maker Sanofi Pasteur, and a protein vaccine supplied by GlaxoSmithKline — that form whats called a ""prime-boost"" approach. One shot primes the immune system to attack HIV and another strengthens that response. For the South African trial, the shots were adapted to the most common HIV strain in southern Africa, and scientists added an additional booster dose in hopes of prolonging protection. South Africa has more than 6.8 million people living with HIV, but the country has had success in rolling out an HIV drug treatment program for 3.1 million people, the largest in the world, according to Doctors Without Borders. Life expectancy in South Africa, which sank as the epidemic grew, has rebounded from 57.1 years in 2009 to 62.9 years in 2014. ___ AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard in Washington contributed to this report.",{},"['africa', 'search', 'infected', 'vaccine', 'test', 'hiv', 'scientists', 'million', 'medical', 'study', 'south', 'resumes']","The latest attempt in the long, frustrating search for a vaccine against HIV began in South Africa on Wednesday, as scientists test a beefed-up version of the only shot ever to show a glimmer of protection.

"More collaborative efforts needed to tackle hepatitis, HIV/AIDS: deputy minister","Efforts in HIV/AIDS control are useless if the lives of those infected remain at risk due to hepatitis, a deputy minister has said",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-06-27,The Jakarta Post,"Efforts in HIV/AIDS control are useless if the lives of those infected remain at risk due to hepatitis, a deputy minister has said. We cannot separate viral hepatitis from HIV/AIDS- related problems because Indonesia is a country with an HIV epidemic that is concentrated in high-risk populations, Health Deputy Minister Ali Ghufron Mukti said in Jakarta on Thursday. He made the remarks during the opening of a national consultative meeting on hepatitis control in Indonesia held by the health ministry. It is estimated that 28 million people in Indonesia have been infected with hepatitis B and C. The 2007 Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) showed that the prevalence of hepatitis stood at 9.4 percent while hepatitis C at 2.1 percent. Unlike other types of hepatitis, which infect people mostly via fecal oral transmission, hepatitis B, C and D can infect patients via parenteral transmission, such as through sharing tools intended for personal use with hepatitis-infected people or through sexual intercourse. Administering the hepatitis B vaccine to newly born babies has been initiated since 1997 to prevent the illness. Although a vaccine for hepatitis C has yet to be developed, the illness can be cured. Hepatitis is an illness that can be prevented and cured, Ghufron said. Developing hepatitis B and C surveillance for high-risk populations is among initiatives the government is taking to prevent the spread of the illness. In the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 2010, Indonesia, together with Brazil and Colombia, initiated the WHA 63.18 Resolution on viral Hepatitis control as a global public health concern. During the 67th WHA in May, countries agreed on Resolution 67.6, which strengthens the previous resolution and calls for concrete action in viral hepatitis control in societies.
