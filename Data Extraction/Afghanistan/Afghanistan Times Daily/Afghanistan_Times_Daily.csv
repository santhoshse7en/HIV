HIV: Life expectancy and outlook,There is no set length of time that a person can live with HIV. Life expectancy increases as new treatments become available. People can now manage HIV as a chronic condition. Learn more here.,,None,"The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years. Thanks to advances in treatment, namely antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV can now expect to live long, healthy lives.

When the HIV and AIDS epidemic began in the United States in the 1980s, HIV was a life-threatening condition. However, people can now manage it as a chronic health condition, much like they would diabetes or heart failure.

In this article, we examine developments in managing and treating HIV, as well as the long-term outlook.

Recent improvements



Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV.

The increase in life expectancy for people living with HIV has direct links to improvements in medical therapy, which includes antiretroviral medications.

These medications help suppress levels of HIV in the blood and slow damage resulting from the infection. This suppression helps prevent progression from HIV to AIDS, or stage 3 HIV.

In the 1980s–1990s, antiretroviral therapy began as monotherapy, then it became dual therapy. Now, there is combination antiretroviral therapy, which includes using three or more drugs.

There are several classes of antiretroviral drugs that attack HIV in different ways. Combinations of drugs are the first-line treatment. People typically start antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV.

A 2017 study in the journal AIDS found that the additional life expectancy for people with HIV at age 20 during the early monotherapy era was 11.8 years. However, that number rose to 54.9 years for the most recent combination antiretroviral era.

Researchers also concluded that people with HIV with higher education had a similar life expectancy to the general population.

Future treatment options



Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection.

Researchers continue to work on a cure for HIV. In the meantime, combination antiretroviral therapy preserves the health of a person with HIV. It does this by suppressing the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. It is important for the person to follow their therapy plan precisely.

In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now report that when a person taking antiretroviral therapy has a negative viral load in their blood, the risk of transmitting the virus to a person without HIV is essentially zero.

This discovery takes researchers to a notion of ""treatment as prevention,"" which promotes well-controlled HIV as a way to prevent transmission through sexual contact, needle sharing, and childbirth and breastfeeding.

Because people with HIV are living much longer, they are starting to face the same health issues as other older adults.

In fact, differentiating Alzheimer's disease from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is becoming an emerging issue in the population of older adults living with HIV.

Even with the advances in antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV may experience long-term side effects of either the therapy or HIV itself.

Conditions common in long-standing HIV infection include:

cardiovascular disease

lung disease

certain cancers

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders

liver disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C

HIV also appears to increase chronic inflammation in the body, putting a person at risk of certain health conditions. However, more research is necessary to better understand this.

Antiretroviral medications have links to both short- and long-term side effects. Most side effects are manageable but can become serious. A person should speak with their healthcare provider about side effects that are of any concern.

Long-term effects from antiretrovirals can include:

kidney failure

liver failure

heart disease

type 2 diabetes

high blood cholesterol levels

lipodystrophy, or changes in how the body stores fat

osteoporosis

neuropathy

Outlook



A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider.

Life expectancy for people living with HIV has seen great improvement in recent years. In fact, a person who currently has HIV can expect to add many years to their life once they start combination antiretroviral treatment.

A 2017 study in the journal HIV Medicine indicates that a person with HIV living in a high-income country would add 43.3 years to their life expectancy if they receive a diagnosis at age 20.

Without adequate treatment, however, HIV can quickly start to damage cells in the immune system.

It is important for a person living with HIV to stick to their treatment plan to keep the virus suppressed in the blood. It is also essential for the person to work closely with their healthcare providers on a regular basis and maintain all other aspects of their health and well-being.","['effects', 'person', 'living', 'antiretroviral', 'life', 'outlook', 'expectancy', 'hiv', 'treatment', 'therapy', 'health']","The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years.

HIV Transmission,Some questions and answers on how HIV is transmitted.,,None,"Some groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including the status of their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live.

When you live in a community where many people have HIV infection, the chances of having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV are higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis atlas to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different US communities. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different populations.

Gay and bisexual men have the largest number of new diagnoses in the United States. Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Also, transgender women who have sex with men are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, and injection drug users remain at significant risk for getting HIV.

Risky behaviors, like having anal or vaginal sex without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV, and sharing needles or syringes play a big role in HIV transmission. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. If you don’t have HIV, being a receptive partner (or bottom) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for getting HIV. If you do have HIV, being the insertive partner (or top) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for transmitting HIV.

But there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, and using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV. Learn more about these and other strategies to prevent HIV.

HIV/AIDS - Symptoms and causes,,,2018-01-19 00:00:00,"Overview

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight the organisms that cause disease.

HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.

There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations.

Symptoms

The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.

Primary infection (Acute HIV)

Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include:

Fever

Headache

Muscle aches and joint pain

Rash

Sore throat and painful mouth sores

Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck

These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.

Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV)

In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells.

This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner.

Symptomatic HIV infection

As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:

Fever

Fatigue

Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection

Diarrhea

Weight loss

Oral yeast infection (thrush)

Shingles (herpes zoster)

Progression to AIDS

Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years.

When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldn't usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system.

The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:

Soaking night sweats

Recurring fever

Chronic diarrhea

Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth

Persistent, unexplained fatigue

Weight loss

Skin rashes or bumps

When to see a doctor

If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible.

Causes

HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding.

How does HIV become AIDS?

HIV destroys CD4 T cells — white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.

You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication.

How HIV spreads

To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:

By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.

You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity. From blood transfusions. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small.

In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. American hospitals and blood banks now screen the blood supply for HIV antibodies, so this risk is very small. By sharing needles. Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.

Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.

How HIV doesn't spread

You can't become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can't catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.

HIV isn't spread through the air, water or insect bites.

Risk factors

When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now it's clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex.

Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you:

Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners.

Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners. Have an STI. Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body.

Many STIs produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for HIV to enter your body. Use intravenous drugs. People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people's blood.

People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people's blood. Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV.

Complications

HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers.

Infections common to HIV/AIDS

Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. It's a leading cause of death among people with AIDS.

This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with HIV, caused by a fungus found in soil. Toxoplasmosis. This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain.

Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. Cryptosporidiosis. This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite that's commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS.

Cancers common to HIV/AIDS

Kaposi's sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi's sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.

In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi's sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs. Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin.

Other complications

Wasting syndrome. Aggressive treatment approaches have reduced the number of cases of wasting syndrome, but it still affects many people with AIDS. It's defined as a loss of at least 10 percent of body weight, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever.

Although AIDS doesn't appear to infect the nerve cells, it can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking. One of the most common neurological complications is AIDS dementia complex, which leads to behavioral changes and reduced mental functioning.

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys that remove excess fluid and wastes from your blood and pass them to your urine. It most often affects blacks or Hispanics. Anyone with this complication should be started on antiretroviral therapy.

Prevention

There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.

We must ensure that quality HIV treatment reaches all those in need,” he mentioned.Hinting to the efforts of the ministry to control AIDS, he stressed that accelerated efforts are necessary to ensure HIV prevention and treatment services reach everyone in need, adding that currently HIV testing and counseling services are available in 10 provinces and nearly 650 people living with HIV are receiving anti-retroviral therapy in two provinces. Five health centers provide services to pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.Feroz termed strengthening of HIV testing methods, expansion of the availability of treatment options and increasing the number of health centers providing anti-retroviral therapy as crucial measures for control of AIDS and HIV epidemic in the country.Country Representative of WHO in Afghanistan, Dr Rechard Peeperkorn,  said that around 37 million people live with HIV all over the world and only a bit over half of them know their HIV status and 1.2 million died from HIV-related causes in 2014 this around 3,300 dying every day.He said that HIV prevalence is low in Afghanistan and HIV epidemic is concentrated among specific groups especially injected group.This year the World HIV Day theme is “HIV Treatment for All”.

TB and HIV co-infection is when people have both, and also either latent or active TB disease. When someone has both HIV, and TB each disease speeds up the progress of the other. When people have a damaged immune system, such as people with HIV who are not receiving antiretroviral treatment, the natural history of TB is altered. Instead of there being a long latency phase between infection and development of disease, people with HIV can become ill with active TB disease within weeks to months, rather than the normal years to decades. TB is a contagious disease that can spread from person to person. TB is caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The TB bacteria spread in their air as well. TB usually affects the lungs. But TB-causing bacteria can attack any part of the body, including the kidneys, spine, or brain. If not treated, TB can cause death. HIV also stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for serious infections and certain cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. This deadly disease most often spared through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person. Women can also give it to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth. There is no cure, but there are many medicines that fight HIV infection and lower the risk of infecting others. People who get early treatment can live with the disease for a longtime. In Afghanistan we are suffering from this deadly disease. To fight HIV, TB, and malaria diseases, the Global Fund, an international financing organization pledged $52 million in assistance to the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH). Deputy health minister, Dr. Ahmad Jan Naim said that this aid would help strengthen measure for prevention of malaria in different ways including distribution of mosquito nets. According to him, deaths from TB would decrease by 50 percent by controlling the disease and deaths from AIDS, malaria, pregnancy diseases would also reduce by improving the health system in Afghanistan in until 2021. Furthermore, he said that part of this donation would go to medicines to cure HIV/AIDS virus for more than 40,000 infected people. Moreover, providing more than four million mosquito nets and diagnosing 700,000 malaria cases as well as treating 158,000 TB patients is also part of program to be cured. Afghanistan has lots of problem in its medical system. However, we are making all out efforts to improving our health system, and one day will reach this goal.","['spread', 'afghanistan', 'system', 'person', 'tb', 'infection', 'editorial', 'infected', 'hiv', 'malaria', 'fighting', 'times', 'disease', 'health']","TB and HIV co-infection is when people have both, and also either latent or active TB disease.

Editorial: Youth is the future,Last day the former President Hamid Karzai in a meeting with the youth representatives held at his o,admin,"February 4, 2018","Related Articles Influential Afghan figures reject participation in JirgaApril 29, 2019 Ghor clash leaves nine security personnel deadApril 29, 2019 Editorial: Light of hopeApril 29, 2019Last day the former President Hamid Karzai in a meeting with the youth representatives held at his office, called the youth as the mighty wealth of the country and said, “Afghanistan would have a bright future with the help of capable youth.” No doubt, the youth, and the future could always be linked, because none can exist in the absence of another. Youth is a significant symbol of strength, and persistence in any society around the world. A nation that fails to invest in the millions of young people is a doomed nation. Without engaging youth in productive activities, their potential to become thought leaders, inspirable and peace-builders would be lost. Unfortunately, today we find a number of youth who are engaged in non-productive activities. In the absence of vision, and goal of life, they choose to spend their precious time doing drugs, and playing video games and sitting at home in front of televisions playing games all the day instead of studying or going to work. The youth of 70s clearly demonstrates the capabilities of the power of unity with a purpose, and strength of profound minds. The young heroes and heroines of that time had definitely changed the socio-political landscape. The youth of that time should not only be celebrated, they should be imitated in many ways. The youth of 2018 should take some time to meditate on the example the youth of 70s has set for them, and the sacrifices they made to make it possible for today’s youth to enjoy certain privileges in today’s education system. It is very disturbing to see how today youth underestimates the importance of education. President Mandela once said, “Without education, your children can never really meet the challenges they will face.” Our children, and youth must be given a modern education and explain that they should be a role for their country. The youth of 2018 should wake up to the reality of today’s challenges and difficulties. Today we face unemployment, HIV/AIDS, drug abuse and organized crimes. Youth has to take a stand against anything, and everything that threatens the possibilities of a brighter future. If we compare the youth of 70s as young lines, then the youth of today should be compared with young eagles. The today’s youth must learn to have a vision and focus as an eagle to restore peace and stability to our war-hit country. President Ashraf Ghani is known for his pro-youth policies and encourages them in every sector. The government must launch some sort of productive initiatives to empower, train and educate our youth in order to make them good and skilled citizens. We are in need to make the youth as the compelling agents of change.

The youth of 2018 should take some time to meditate on the example the youth of 70s has set for them, and the sacrifices they made to make it possible for today’s youth to enjoy certain privileges in today’s education system.
It is very disturbing to see how today youth underestimates the importance of education.
If we compare the youth of 70s as young lines, then the youth of today should be compared with young eagles.
The today’s youth must learn to have a vision and focus as an eagle to restore peace and stability to our war-hit country."

Viral hepatitis major health challenge in Afghanistan,AT News Report-KABUL:  Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) on Sunday called the viral hepatitis as a ma,admin,"July 30, 2017","Related Articles Influential Afghan figures reject participation in JirgaApril 29, 2019 Ghor clash leaves nine security personnel deadApril 29, 2019 Editorial: Light of hopeApril 29, 2019AT News Report-KABUL:  Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) on Sunday called the viral hepatitis as a major health challenge in Afghanistan, saying it requires urgent actions to strengthen prevention.MoPH and World Health Organization (WHO) and partners marked the World Hepatitis Day on Sunday to increase public awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis and the diseases that it causes. Viral hepatitis – a group of infectious diseases known as hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E – affects millions of people worldwide, causing acute and chronic liver disease and killing close to 1.4 million people every year, comparable to deaths due to tuberculosis and more than the deaths due to HIV.According to MoPH only one in 20 people with viral hepatitis know they have it, making hepatitis a dangerous and silent killer. Viral hepatitis remains a serious health issue in Afghanistan, especially among vulnerable groups –among injecting drug users hepatitis B prevalence is nearly 7 percent, while hepatitis C prevalence is at 31percent.“Viral hepatitis is a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response,” said H.E. Deputy Minister of Public Health Dr. Feda Mohammad Paikan. “The Ministry of Public Health continues to scale up its response to viral hepatitis. We support the provision of testing and counseling services for hepatitis B and C through voluntary testing and counseling centers across the country and the hepatitis B vaccine is now part of Afghanistan’s national immunization program. We need to step up our efforts to ensure that not a single Afghan dies of hepatitis B or C, which are preventable and treatable.”Hepatitis viruses are transmitted through different routes: hepatitis A and E through contaminated food and water; hepatitis B through blood and other bodily fluids, and hepatitis C mostly through blood. Hepatitis D is an additional infection in the presence of Hepatitis B. These viruses all cause acute hepatitis which is characterized by fatigue, loss of appetite, fever and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes).Hepatitis infection can be prevented by providing safe food and water (hepatitis A and E), vaccines (hepatitis A, B, and E), screening of blood donations and provision of sterile injecting equipment and assuring infection control (hepatitis B and C). Awareness, testing and treatment are key to fighting the virus.“Every single person could be affected by viral hepatitis and we all have a part to play to achieve elimination,” said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Afghanistan Country Representative. “WHO is committed to supporting the Ministry of Public Health and partners to fight this silent killer. There is a need to further strengthen access to testing, raise public awareness to fight the stigma associated with the disease, widen vaccination coverage,  improve prevention at health care settings, and provide treatment for people suffering from the disease.”","['afghanistan', 'challenge', 'major', 'ministry', 'infection', 'hepatitis', 'c', 'testing', 'times', 'disease', 'health', 'b', 'viral', 'public']","AT News Report-KABUL: Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) on Sunday called the viral hepatitis as a major health challenge in Afghanistan, saying it requires urgent actions to strengthen prevention.

Rehabilitation of addicts: A long road ahead,By Farhad Naibkhel-KABUL: The Public Health Ministry has collected hundreds of drug addicts. The hea,admin,"February 26, 2016","Related Articles Influential Afghan figures reject participation in JirgaApril 29, 2019 Ghor clash leaves nine security personnel deadApril 29, 2019 Editorial: Light of hopeApril 29, 2019By Farhad Naibkhel-KABUL: The Public Health Ministry has collected hundreds of drug addicts. The health ministry wants to rehabilitate them so they could realize what a healthy life means. They story of these drug users have begun from under bridge and on the street life. They were haunted by the nightmares during the cold weather. Now they are coping with the nightmares in the old US forces complex, “Camp Phoenix”. The camp has been turned into a full-fledge rehabilitation center.Addicts are the most vulnerable segment of the Afghan society. They spend their entire life in miserable condition, until brought for rehabilitation. They live under the bridges and on streets without having any facility to keep themselves warm in winter and cool in summer. They sat under the scorching sun in summer and coped with the heavy rains because they were out of their senses. They had no access to any social service, even to clean water and healthy food. However, the number of drug addicts brought for rehabilitation is not more than a pinch of salt.Most of addicts are still have affairs with the ghost of drug. The short euphoria or kick has pushed them away from realities and families. Besides drug addiction, most of them are suffering from different diseases and infections that are leading to their death.Some of the narcotics users are infected by HIV/AIDS—a disease that leaves no one alive. Almost all seasons are full of threat for the addicted people living on the street but winter is life-threatening for them.Every night hundreds of homeless addicts sleep in shadow of nightmares on the street and under bridges, particularly in the western part of Kabul city. Pul-e-Sukhta is considered a hub of the addicts where the poisonous fume of heroine brings them together.During winter season one or two dead bodies of addicted people, who passed away due to cold weather, are daily transferred by police in the morning from Pul-e-Sukhta area.Luckily, the rehabilitation center is a ray of hope for the addicts. They are afraid now of coming to the center but one day they will realize that how it changed their life. They will wish that if they had earlier for treatment they would have utilized their time in appropriate manner to keep the family bond strong.“I had a tired life, full of problems, when shifted to this center for treatment,” said Nasim, 28-year old addict. Nasim was shifted to the 1,500 bed treatment center in Kabul recently.He told Afghanistan Times that no one considers addicts human. “We were not feeling safe even in the street and under the bridge. People were look at us with contempt.”Narrating his ordeal, he said that addicts like him had no access to healthy food and potable water. Addicts have no place to keep warm in winter. Drug users were sleeping under the bridges or on footpaths, sometimes in front of shops, Nasim recalled.“For the last four years I was using heroin. My addicted friends were the reason behind my addiction. Before addiction I had a shop. After becoming addicted I used my income and assets to buy heroin. A stage in my life came when my shop was empty and left nothing to sell. Ultimately, I closed the shop,” he remembered.He elaborated that after closing the shop he has no place at home. “My family did not accept me because I was an addict. So I found my place on streets and under the Pul-e-Sukhta Bridge.”Now Nasim accepts that narcotics ruin life. “Using drug is a satanic habit. A drug user will find money through satanic ways to purchase heroin,” he sighed as he was sentenced to death but he was pardoned.“I am happy to quite up addiction after treatment and become a normal person in the society,” Nasim vowed. His eyes were confirming that he had understood the reality that life is too precious and should not be wasted in smokes.After treatment the government had to provide jobs to the rehabilitated addicts; otherwise, they would run again towards drug, he suggested.Esmat, another drug user in the rehabilitation center, said that he was in love but failed to tie know with her. To run from the reality, he embraced opium. However, addiction was in his blood before that because he was using hashish. For the past two years he was using opium.Voicing his pleasure over good manners of doctors and nurses in the center, he said the addicts had access to all facilities including bed, bathroom, medicines, healthy food and water. He said that the government must arrest drug sellers who are running lives of the people.He said that the drug sellers have link with some security officials, thus they sell drug to addicted people without any fear.During his visit to rehabilitation center, Chief Executive Officer Abdullah Abdullah urged Ministry of Interior (MoI) to increase crackdowns against the drug mafia in the country.He said: “Considering complaints of the addicts regarding the narcotics sellers I direct the interior ministry to accelerate operations against them [drug mafia] throughout the country. If serious action was not taken against the drug sellers, the campaign to rehabilitate the addicts will not be successful.”Minister of Public Health Ferozuddin Feroz said that last month 700 addicted people were collected from Kabul city and shifted to the newly established treatment center.He said that the ministry in coordination with Ministry of Counter Narcotics (MoCN) and other relevant organizations started the campaign to collect the addicted people in Kabul. The minister furthered that the campaign will continue.Feroz said that efforts are underway to shift 800 more addicts to the treatment center in the near future. In addition to treatment, the rehabilitated people will get vocational and educational training in the center, he mentioned.This was one side of the picture—bright and promising. However, the other side is dark and challenging. The number of drug addicts is still on the rise, day by day. A visit to Pul-e-Sukhta and other areas validate this fear. According to a report, three million Afghans are using drugs.Scores of them are begging. Several others are daily wagers. Some of the addicts are involved in smuggling and stealing to afford their addiction.The government had run such campaigns in the past too. But the success rate was disheartening. It is too early to predict the outcome of the current campaign.","['addicts', 'afghanistan', 'nasim', 'addicted', 'long', 'life', 'center', 'ahead', 'using', 'rehabilitation', 'times', 'drug', 'treatment', 'road', 'ministry']","The camp has been turned into a full-fledge rehabilitation center.

Through this letter, issued with collaboration of Gulf States agencies working on terror, the US directly mentioned names of two neighbouring countries whereas its public and private sectors are not only extending financial and logistic support but also guiding/facilitating the terror acts in Afghanistan. According to letter, income or money minted from drugs trafficking plays a key role in continuation of violent acts in Afghanistan. Culture of drugs money using in violent and subversive activities is not new. In recent past, spy masters from a number of countries, responsible for flourishing of extremism and terrorism in Afghanistan have been condemned by global media. At early stage, through heroin smuggling sponsors and patrons have addressed maximum needs of fighters in Afghanistan. As a result the trend converted into a culture and now recognized as “terror economy” throughout the world. The US and Gulf States collaboration of making expose the terror financiers could be considered a good omen. In fact since a long the US is known for “eyeing in own interests.” On such rounds the new list should not be exploited for the US own strategic-economic interests in the region. But it should be used sincerely for ending of over four decades old era of hostilities, violence and bloodshed on the soil of Afghanistan. Each and every human throughout the world realizes miseries of Afghans who are no more capable of witnessing bloodshed on their motherland. They are desirous for peace and tranquility and for the purpose they not only welcomed the US led allies some 17 years back but even made blind faiths on each and every act/action of US but the results remain too much disappointing. On ending of US led allies field operation, the regional and neighboring countries have not only resumed its interference in internal affairs of Afghanistan but along with financing now these foreign countries are bent up on sabotaging of political and democratic processes. Regional and neighboring countries intend to monopolize internal and external policies of Afghanistan, which might be a severe blow to its sovereignty and solidarity. It is the time for US, Gulf Region and other countries to arrest the growing trends of terror within Afghanistan otherwise it would definitely affect the global peace.","['afghanistan', 'chinese', 'idress', 'editorial', 'financing', 'check', 'militants', 'kabul', 'times', 'ambassador', 'report', 'deputy', 'zaman', 'foreign', 'minister']",Check AlsoAT News Report KABUL: Afghan Foreign Deputy Minister Idress Zaman and Chinese Ambassador to Afghanistan …

Pakistani paramilitary forces have been firing thousands of missiles into eastern provinces over the past years, claiming lives of tens of civilians. The cross-line incursions also inflicted heavy financial loses.Relations between Kabul and Islamabad remained tense since fall of the de-facto Taliban region. Pakistani authorities have been blaming Afghans for militancy though it is explicit that various jihadi organizations have been trained and feted by them and their Inter-Service Intelligence is protecting the Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders in order to pursue their strategic depth policy.The Afghan government has to answer the cross-line missile attacks in proper ways or the leaders will soon get into hot water as public rage against Pakistan and Afghan leaders, sitting in power corridors, is on rise. The government would find itself in bind if people take matters into their own hands – an option which would be seen as viable by the residents.To resolve the issue through diplomatic channels would be a wild goose chase as the Pakistani government could not resist the powerful military dogma which is in the quest to deteriorate Afghan-Pak relationships, aimed at avoiding slash in defense budget and its unchecked authority. Hence, the Afghan authorities should prepare comprehensive security plans to prevent Pakistan from violating sovereignty of Afghanistan.As initiation, more troops should be deployed along the Durand Line, especially in Kunar, Nangarhar, and Kandahar provinces. The troops should be equipped with long-range heavy weaponry, including anti-aircraft guns and missiles. If Afghan authorities say that tit-for-tat response from Afghan security forces would kill civilians on the other side of the Durand Line, then they are wrong because civilians on the other side of the line are living far behind military posts.In Islamabad’s controlled tribal belt, anti-Pakistan sentiments are all time high. The Afghan government should cash this opportunity as it is the right time to end Pakistan’s interference into the country once and for all. To assure the safety of tribesmen, the Afghan government may initiate a mutual understanding with tribesmen across the line and garner their support for the Afghan forces – as people there are increasingly fed up with atrocities of Pakistani troops and are looking for resuscitation. Afghan security brass should come to terms with the fact that the later they act the sooner civilians fatalities rise and the bolder the Pakistani will get.","['afghanistan', 'security', 'civilians', 'shelling', 'leaders', 'line', 'editorial', 'pakistani', 'forces', 'troops', 'unrestricted', 'times', 'crossline', 'authorities', 'afghan']","It seems there is no end to Pakistan’s brazen and unprovoked cross-line attacks into Afghanistan, as Pakistani gunship choppers keep violating Afghanistan’s sovereignty and target civilian homes in eastern Afghanistan.

Afghans are victims of terrorism resurgence: India,AT Monitoring Desk-KABUL: Prosperity is impossible without peace in the region and the greatest cont,admin,"March 28, 2018","Related Articles Influential Afghan figures reject participation in JirgaApril 29, 2019 Ghor clash leaves nine security personnel deadApril 29, 2019 Editorial: Light of hopeApril 29, 2019AT Monitoring Desk-KABUL: Prosperity is impossible without peace in the region and the greatest contemporary threat to peace is terrorism, a top Indian diplomat said on Tuesday.Addressing the Tashkent Conference, MJ Akbar said: “Our Afghan brothers and sisters are being denied both rights and opportunity by fear and violence. They are victims of ideological extremism and brutal terrorism.”The unrelenting bout of terrorism was sponsored from outside Afghanistan’s borders by elements trapped in regressive doctrine and cynical interests,” Akbar remarked.He said the Indians were profoundly troubled by the continuing suffering of the Afghans, a tragedy that had crossed generations and must come to an immediate end.There could be neither solution nor resolution without principled commitment to law and democracy as the basis of order and to human rights, the deputy minister believed.At the centre of human rights, he explained, was gender emancipation: the right of women to equality, education, social assertion and full participation in the economic and political life of Afghanistan.He applauded the courage of the long-suffering Afghan leaders and people who nurtured change and advanced in the most difficult circumstances.Akbar noted significant improvement in several socio-economic indices of Afghanistan. Agirl child born in 2001, now 17, has received education and dreams of a better future.There has been an eight-fold increase in student enrollment from fewer than 1 million students in 2001 to more than 8 million students enrolled in schools in 2016. More than a third are girls.“It is our responsibility, each one of us, to protect this young girl for she is the symbol of change we want to see. We cannot abandon these gains in search of a political settlement…”Peace and reconciliation were difficult objectives in an atmosphere of terror and violence, he said, supporting strong action to pursue those who still chose the path of terrorism.“India stands committed to any process which can help Afghanistan emerge as a united, peaceful, secure, stable, inclusive and economically vibrant nation, with guaranteed gender and human rights.“We must all conform to internationally recognized red-lines. I also wish to reiterate India’s willingness and keenness to engage Afghanistan bilaterally and multilaterally, in cooperation with likeminded countries and international organisations,” he added.India has worked with principle and commitment to serve the Afghan people through capacity building, gender emancipation, human resource development, infrastructure development, connectivity, trade and investment.India’s developmental assistance to Afghanistan stands at $ 3 billion. Last year, the two nations embarked upon the ‘New Development Partnership’, which will support 116 ‘High-Impact Community Development Projects’ in Afghanistan.A well-connected Afghanistan could hope to become economically vibrant, prosperous and politically stable, he thought. Indian’s grant aid of 170,000 tonnesof wheat supplies to Afghanistan is currently transiting through Chabahar.The India-Afghanistan Air Freight Corridor, established in June 2017, is another important achievement. There are now cargo flights between Kabul, Kandahar, New Delhi and Mumbai.India will host the first cricket Test match involving Afghanistan in Bengaluru in June this year. A few days back, Afghanistan qualified for the next Cricket World Cup.","['afghanistan', 'chinese', 'idress', 'check', 'minister', 'foreign', 'india', 'victims', 'kabul', 'times', 'ambassador', 'resurgence', 'report', 'deputy', 'zaman', 'terrorism', 'afghans']",Check AlsoAT News Report KABUL: Afghan Foreign Deputy Minister Idress Zaman and Chinese Ambassador to Afghanistan …
Editorial: No time for discrimination,It is crystal fact that there is no internal misunderstanding among different Afghan ethnicities nat,admin,"December 4, 2017","Related Articles Influential Afghan figures reject participation in JirgaApril 29, 2019 Ghor clash leaves nine security personnel deadApril 29, 2019 Editorial: Light of hopeApril 29, 2019It is crystal fact that there is no internal misunderstanding among different Afghan ethnicities nationwide, and unity was and will remain always among us. There is no space or room for discrimination, and those who are making attempt to infiltrate this disease into normal life of the Afghan masses, is our biggest enemy that has to be triggered to the court. This would be very unwise if someone to say that there is no unity, rather we proved this in difficult times. When the Islamic State (IS), also known as Daesh terrorist group targeted particular ethnic masses to stimulate discrimination among Afghan tribes, but this evil designs of the militants was dashed to the ground after receiving iron hand of the Afghans with unity on the horizon. When our worshippers were martyred in different mosques, every Afghans regardless of who the victim were, stood in solidarity with them, proving we were and are one nation. There are more than 20 terrorist groups in Afghanistan, all of them are hell-bent on killing Afghans, in the meantime making enormous efforts to smash the chain of unity among Afghans—a desire they (militants) will dig it with them to the graves. However, we don’t have time for such things; we have lived like brothers and sisters in the course of history, and will live like this forever. The new generation of Afghanistan is not even thinking of such narrow fad; rather youths are working collectively for the development of sciences and technology in order to meet the challenges of modern times. Moreover, we are working to improve agriculture productions and develop the agricultural technology sector, noting the fact that Afghanistan is an agricultural state, having vast farming lands. We can reach economy self-sufficiency, if fundamentally improve our culture sectors, leaving underground and mineral resources that definitely plays huge role once extracted. Furthermore, our government struggling to educate our girls and boys, as only by educated countrymen and women, we can steer our country toward development and prosperity. Though, education system remains fragile as a result of longtime wars, but also rapidly improving. So all of us, Pashtun, Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek, Aimak, Turkmen, Baloch, Pashai, Nuristani, and others ethnic groups, have no time for ethnic tension, or any sort of discrimination. We are all Afghans and will put indefatigable efforts to rebuild our motherland. The good news is that President Ashraf Ghani said that discrimination against residents of the country is unacceptable and the government is to take action over the issue. “Our society doesn’t’ need discrimination, it doesn’t allow it.” President Ghani, surely we, as Afghans will never allow any type of discrimination in our society. Many of us believe that the real man is the one who has money, wealth and respect, but don’t’ forget that this comes when there is unity, and mutual respect. By unity, we can live a peaceful, non-violent and more important, united and prosperous life—this is what we want. We are proud that Afghanistan is a multi-ethnic country where several beliefs, mentalities and mindsets are cherished and individuals live a peaceful life with the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood. Our unity is a great slap in the face of enemies, and none can wobble this. Can’t turn blind eye over current challenges in the country, but when it is a matter of unity and national interests, there is no doubt we are one nation and unity will be here always—none can destroy it.","['country', 'afghanistan', 'editorial', 'ethnic', 'live', 'times', 'working', 'unity', 'afghan', 'discrimination', 'afghans']","This would be very unwise if someone to say that there is no unity, rather we proved this in difficult times.

Violence is on the rise in Afghanistan: Hamid Karzai,Former President Hamid Karzai briefs DW on the continued security problems in Afghanistan. He advoca,admin,"November 28, 2017","Related Articles Influential Afghan figures reject participation in JirgaApril 29, 2019 Ghor clash leaves nine security personnel deadApril 29, 2019 Editorial: Light of hopeApril 29, 2019Former President Hamid Karzai briefs DW on the continued security problems in Afghanistan. He advocates an immediate appraisal of what’s gone wrong, saying Afghanistan’s future is in the hands of the younger generation.DW: Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai, thank you for being here at the DW headquarters in Bonn. After more than 16 years of US and NATO forces being in your country, how would you describe the security situation?Hamid Karzai: The security situation unfortunately isn’t what we desired. It is far less than what we desired. There are daily bombs around the country, there is daily insecurity around the country, there is a greater part of the country under the control of non-government forces. Violence is on the increase. After 16 years of our campaign against extremism and terrorism we still have new terrorist groups emerging in Afghanistan. Daesh [an Arabic name for the “Islamic State” — Editor’s note] has emerged. We have questions as to why.Well, that’s a good question. What is the biggest problem that’s stopping Afghanistan from becoming peaceful? That’s what many people outside of Afghanistan are asking themselves.There are two main factors. Let me put it this way. Some would say it is because of Afghanistan. No, it is not because of Afghanistan or of the Afghan people. The Afghan people cooperated fully with the international community with a great desire to see their country peaceful and nice and prosperous and democratic, which we did. It is factors outside of Afghanistan which are more decisive with regard to security and stability of Afghanistan. Pakistan was the main factor and we all knew and the world knew: The sanctuaries there, the training grounds there, the financial resources provided to terrorism and the ideological inputs that they give to terrorism and send to Afghanistan. The second most important factor or rather equally important factor was the whole conduct of US strategy in Afghanistan. The approach to Afghanistan and approach to fighting extremism was very heavy handed. Civilian casualties in Afghanistan, creation of prisons in Afghanistan, the violation of our sovereignty and violation of Afghan homes and culture and values. All that accumulated and put together brought us where we are today.President Ashraf Ghani has promised parliamentary elections for next year. But many experts doubt that this will happen because of the current security situation. What do you think?We hope it happens. We very much want it to happen. It’s too late already. Our constitution must be run well. Therefore parliamentary elections are of the highest importance for the Afghan people. Yes, we have the desire to have parliamentary elections. Whether we will have them or not is a different question. And we must prepare all we can to have the country follow the path of democracy. Parliamentary elections are one very important component of that, so the desire is there. The actual possibilities have to be seen. But let’s push for it, let’s work for it.From your point of view what’s the biggest priority right now in Afghanistan?I think the biggest priority for Afghanistan is for the Afghan people to put their heads together and to study as to what has gone wrong in this country. Where are we to blame, where is the US to blame, where are our neighbors to blame? And to evaluate and analyze the situation and come up with solutions.For that I believe a Loya Jirga, the traditional council of the Afghan people, is the best forum. Where people from across the country, where all the people of Afghanistan from all the provinces and from all the groups of Afghanistan get together, young, old, educated, community leaders, religious leaders, spiritual leaders, women, men. They must decide on what we must do to bring safety and a better life to the Afghan people. I believe that’s the way forward.You have supported the Loya Jirga in the past as well. Do you think that a decision made by Loya Jirga could replace the parliamentary election?No, the Loya Jirga should not replace parliament or the convening of the elections. The Loya Jirga should prepare the ground, smoothen the ground for the convening of elections and the arrival of parliament. So it should be a helper to that process not a preventer and it will be a helper.You have spoken about the role of the United States. US-President Donald Trump has decided to send more troops to Afghanistan. In the past you have said that you opposed this idea. However, in 2009 when troops in Afghanistan were increased you were President. So what has changed?I opposed it then, too. And if you remember, the US ambassador at the time wrote to Washington saying that Karzai is not our partner and he was right. I wasn’t their partner in causing more war to Afghanistan and in bringing more casualties to the Afghan people. In creating prisons, in the violation of Afghan sovereignty and rule of law. If the US presence in Afghanistan contributes to the safety and security of our people, to bringing peace to Afghanistan, to strengthening and enhancing our sovereignty I’m very much for it. There is no ideological issue here with the United States; it is the facts of life in Afghanistan. Lack of peace, lack of security, lack of hope for the future.This is why the Afghan people have been fleeing their country. Thousands of Afghans are living in Europe now even though some are sent back. Do you agree that there are safe zones, as the German government calls them, in Afghanistan?Yes, cities are safe. There are occasional bombs but that’s for all of us. My children are there. There are lots of other people. Millions of Afghans whose children are there. Our young people should be in their own country, they should contribute to their own country and should work in their own country.But people are dying.Yes we are dying. But that’s our hope. You don’t leave. You don’t run away from your home because someone else is dying in that country. How have nations built their countries? By staying there and contributing to their own revival and progress. Now my advice is twofold. One, to the Afghans who are still in Afghanistan, to the young ones my advice is: Don’t leave your country. Let’s put our hands together and build our country and make it a better place. At the end of the day it’s up to us Afghans to do that. No foreign country can build us and make us better.So you do agree that the German government should deport Afghans back home?Those who have not been accepted must come to Afghanistan proudly, they must live in their country. Those who are accepted here they must respect the laws of this country and become a good force for integration in this country. And there is also an advice for Germany. The government of Germany must sit down with its European partners and begin to talk with the United States of America, because the consequences of failure in Afghanistan reach Germany. Germany must make sure that America adopts the right approach, an approach that brings hope in the future to Afghanistan by bringing peace and a working environment to Afghanistan. So Germany also has a role, within Europe, through Europe, with the USA and our neighbors and the big countries in the region to do that. We have a role by keeping our young people in our country.","['rise', 'country', 'hamid', 'afghanistan', 'violence', 'security', 'parliamentary', 'loya', 'jirga', 'germany', 'karzai', 'times', 'thats', 'elections', 'afghan']","Former President Hamid Karzai briefs DW on the continued security problems in Afghanistan.
