$8.7m grant signed to scale up fight against HIV,KABUL (Pajhwok): The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund on Wednesday signed a $8.7 million grant with the Ministry of Public Health to scale up HIV prevention measures and treatment for people most at risk of contracting the virus.,Pajhwok,2016-07-13 00:00:00,"KABUL (Pajhwok): The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund on Wednesday signed a $8.7 million grant with the Ministry of Public Health to scale up HIV prevention measures and treatment for people most at risk of contracting the virus.The epidemic continues to spread among key populations at higher risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Injecting drug use is a major driver of HIV infections in Afghanistan, a country that is also the world’s leading producer of opium and heroin.A statement from UNDP said a combination of injecting practices involving the use of non-sterile equipment, high-risk sexual behaviour, punitive policies and stigma towards people who inject drugs are fuelling the epidemic.The most recent drug use survey showed eight per cent of the population aged 15-64 is dependent on drugs, with significant increases in the number of people who use opium and heroin. Minister of Public Health Ferozudd in Ferozsaid: “With this grant we’ll be able to expand treatment and care for people living with HIV, boost our prevention efforts and raise awareness among vulnerable groups that are key to controlling and reversing the HIV epidemic.”Men with high-risk sexual behaviour may play a larger role in HIV transmission than previously thought. They also experience stigma and discrimination in their own families and communities, and are confronted with punitive laws, prosecution and a lack of access to HIV prevention services.UNDP Country Director Douglas Keh said: “Without reducing stigma associated with drug use, and implementing prevention programmes that treat every person with dignity, compassion, and respect, regardless of circumstance or condition, Afghanistan’s efforts to curb the HIV epidemic will fall short. We need to go the extra mile and this new grant will help us do it,”To address high levels of stigma and discrimination, the grant will strengthen legal and policy environments in order to promote access to HIV prevention, treatment and support for people vulnerable to and affected by HIV, securing their meaningful involvement in the response to HIV in Afghanistan.pr/mud","['treatment', 'risk', 'scale', 'prevention', 'vulnerable', 'sexual', 'drug', 'grant', 'fight', '87m', 'stigma', 'undp', 'signed', 'hiv']","KABUL (Pajhwok): The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund on Wednesday signed a $8.7 million grant with the Ministry of Public Health to scale up HIV prevention measures and treatment for people most at risk of contracting the virus.

$8.7m grant signed to scale up fight against HIV,KABUL (Pajhwok): The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund on Wednesday signed a $8.7 million grant with the Ministry of Public Health to scale up HIV prevention measures and treatment for people most at risk of contracting the virus.,Pajhwok,None,"KABUL (Pajhwok): The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund on Wednesday signed a $8.7 million grant with the Ministry of Public Health to scale up HIV prevention measures and treatment for people most at risk of contracting the virus.The epidemic continues to spread among key populations at higher risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Injecting drug use is a major driver of HIV infections in Afghanistan, a country that is also the world’s leading producer of opium and heroin.A statement from UNDP said a combination of injecting practices involving the use of non-sterile equipment, high-risk sexual behaviour, punitive policies and stigma towards people who inject drugs are fuelling the epidemic.The most recent drug use survey showed eight per cent of the population aged 15-64 is dependent on drugs, with significant increases in the number of people who use opium and heroin. Minister of Public Health Ferozudd in Ferozsaid: “With this grant we’ll be able to expand treatment and care for people living with HIV, boost our prevention efforts and raise awareness among vulnerable groups that are key to controlling and reversing the HIV epidemic.”Men with high-risk sexual behaviour may play a larger role in HIV transmission than previously thought. They also experience stigma and discrimination in their own families and communities, and are confronted with punitive laws, prosecution and a lack of access to HIV prevention services.UNDP Country Director Douglas Keh said: “Without reducing stigma associated with drug use, and implementing prevention programmes that treat every person with dignity, compassion, and respect, regardless of circumstance or condition, Afghanistan’s efforts to curb the HIV epidemic will fall short. We need to go the extra mile and this new grant will help us do it,”To address high levels of stigma and discrimination, the grant will strengthen legal and policy environments in order to promote access to HIV prevention, treatment and support for people vulnerable to and affected by HIV, securing their meaningful involvement in the response to HIV in Afghanistan.pr/mud","['treatment', 'risk', 'scale', 'prevention', 'vulnerable', 'sexual', 'drug', 'grant', 'fight', '87m', 'stigma', 'undp', 'signed', 'hiv']","KABUL (Pajhwok): The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund on Wednesday signed a $8.7 million grant with the Ministry of Public Health to scale up HIV prevention measures and treatment for people most at risk of contracting the virus.

Second hand clothes could spread skin diseases,KABUL (PAN,Mohammad Jawad Sharifzada,2011-03-01 00:00:00,"KABUL (PAN): For many poor people in the Afghan capital, the second-hand clothes market provides an affordable option to keep warm in winter. But doctors are warning that wearing unwashed clothes may cause skin diseases. Second-hand clothes are sold all over the capital, in shops and on hand carts. The demand goes up during the winter months when the temperatures can drop to below freezing and only a few Afghans are lucky enough to have the simple wood-burning stove in their homes. Ramazan, 38, a father of four, bought second-hand winter clothes for his 3-year-old child from a hand cart near Pamir Cinema in Kabul city.  Asked why he did not buy new clothes for his child, he replied he did not have the money to do so.""I am a labourer and have a low income. I have to purchase second-hand clothes.  Unless the clothes are very dirty, we don’t wash them. I did not know that wearing second-hand clothes could cause skin diseases,” he said.  Ramazan said that he and his children often get sick and he did not know the reason for it.People who wear second-hand clothes must wash or disinfect the items before they wear them or they may suffer from different kinds of skin diseases, Dr. Abdul Matin Baha, a dermatologist at Maiwand Hospital in Kabul, said. Diseases like dermatitis, scabies and fungal diseases can be passed on by wearing unwashed second-hand clothes, he said, advising that clothes be washed with warm water and disinfectant and ironed on both sides.Used shoes and sandals can also carry skin diseases, and should be washed with warm water and disinfectant, Baha said.Clothes which come into direct contact with the skin, such as underwear, can be the most dangerous if they are not disinfected well.Baha advised paying more attention to the washing of these types of garments.Mehro 55, who was buying sweaters for her 9-year old daughter said she could not afford to buy new clothes for her children.She has nine children and her husband is a hand cart vendor. ""We are poor, we have to buy used clothing,"" she said.“These clothes may cause disease but the winter weather is also dangerous,” she said.The price of a second-hand sweater is between 40 afgnanis ($0.80) to 70 afghanis, while at the store such an item can cost 300 afghanis, she said.""Two months ago, one of my children got an itchy rash all over his body. When we took him to the doctor he said it was due to wearing used clothing,"" she said.Mir Hassan 42, who sells second-hand clothes near Pamir Cinema said they do not wash the clothes before selling them.According to him, they buy second-hand clothes from traders in the Chindawol or Mandawi area, and then they sell them on.Most of their customers are poor, he said.“Prices will increase if the traders wash and disinfect the clothes and then people cannot afford to buy them,” he said.Faiz Mohammad, 25, who sells children’s used sweaters in Kabul’s city centre, said most of his customers are poor and cannot afford to buy new clothes.""The weather is very cold and most of our clients are poor; therefore, they have to buy used clothes, and they put them on their children unwashed.""Most of the used clothes, including sweaters, coats, shirts, under wear, socks, boots, shoes and sandals are imported from European countries, the United States and Canada, according to traders.  Mohammad Qasim Sahebi, a doctor at Jamhoriat Hospital, also said certain bacteria and infections could be spread by second-hand clothes.The bacteria on the clothes are very resistant and so unless the garments are treated, the germs will remain and cause skin diseases, he said.Sahebi advised storing the clothes for 48 hours in a cold area, then washing them with disinfectant and warm water and using a hot iron on both sides.He said the media division of the Ministry of Public Health should advise people on how to treat second-hand clothes to avoid the spread of skin diseases.Dr. Mohammad Hakim Satar, deputy chief of the environmental health department, acknowledged his department had not done anything to promote better treatment of used clothing.His department was more involved in the field of air pollution, food safety and safe drinking water, he said.cas/","['hand', 'clothes', 'diseases', 'used', 'wash', 'water', 'spread', 'second', 'poor', 'secondhand', 'buy', 'wearing', 'skin']","I did not know that wearing second-hand clothes could cause skin diseases,” he said.

However, he acknowledged challenges still remained.In Asia 330 million people still live in absolute poverty on less than $1.90 a day. Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and climate actions and collective priorities for Asian economies, the bank has started discussing its long-term strategy, whose five priorities are to be considered:1. Infrastructuredevelopment: This remains ADB's top priority. A recent report by the bank found that $1.7 trillion per year through 2030 is needed in investments in power, transport, telecommunications, and water for the region's development.""This is more than double our previous estimate, reflecting additional investments needed to support continued growth and address climate change,"" said Nakao.2. Support for poorest and fragile countries and inclusiveness: While progress in Asia has been impressive, health and education are top on the list of ADB's development goals.""In health, we will support universal healthcare systems and cross-border initiatives to combat communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV. In education, we will continue to support Technical and Vocational Education and Training, or TVET, and help improve the quality of secondary education,"" he said.3. Gender equality: Nakao said they would strengthen their gender equality work since ""gender is a cross-cutting issue that influences all social and economic processes.""  It will design projects that help women and girls secure higher skills, better health, more jobs and a larger voice in decision making.4. Using private resources for development, the ADB aims to promote greater and more effective use of public–private partnerships (PPPs). It is also financing projects by private companies working on solar, wind and geothermal power infrastructure, highways, telecommunications and ports, as well as projects in education, health, and agriculture and further still the ADB priorities are funding micro, small and medium sized enterprises through local banks.5. ADB will ensure reforms to better conduct its work in the most efficient way. ""ADB will strengthen its sector and thematic expertise, enhance staff capacity and streamline procedures. We will deepen our collaboration with civil society, academia, the private sector and local authorities,"" Nakao promised.nh/pr/mud","['longterm', 'development', 'education', 'private', 'priorities', 'pursue', 'projects', 'support', 'health', 'strategy', 'nakao', 'adb', 'gender']","YOKOHAMA (Pajhwok): The 50th Board of Governors Conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) ended on Monday, with a promise to consider five priorities as part of a long-term strategy of the institution.
