Drug ‘can greatly reduce risk of HIV infection’,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Khaama Press,2010-11-25T08:26:11+00:00,"A drug used to treat HIV-positive patients may offer gay and bisexual men some protection against contracting the virus, the authors of a new study say.Trials of the combination drug Truvada among nearly 2,500 men suggested it could reduce the chances of male-to-male HIV infection by 44%.Those using the drug regularly could further reduce the risk of infection, it was claimed.The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Pills and condoms Truvada is the trade name of a drug manufactured by the California-based company Gilead Sciences Inc which combines two antiretroviral drugs, used to treat Aids.But this new study looks at whether it could be used to prevent HIV infection in the first place.Almost 2,500 gay or bisexual men were randomly selected in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand and the United States. Half were given the pill, half were given dummy tablets.All the men were also given condoms and counselling on safe sex.What the researchers found after about a year of testing was that the drug appeared to cut male-to-male HIV transmission by 44%, when the group taking the pill was compared with the placebo group.Those who took the pill regularly were deemed to have reduced their risk of infection further, by up to 73%, and blood tests were run to confirm this relationship between pill-usage and protection levels.The research was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the federal US body, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The pills were donated by their manufacturer.NIAID director, Dr Anthony Fauci, conceded more work needed to be done, but called the results impressive.“This has been done in men who have sex with men. We need to know if we get similar results in women as well as in heterosexual men, which we have reason to believe we will,” he told the BBC.“We also need to get a long term view of were there any toxicities. We didn’t see anything that was significant but we need to follow that for a long period of time.”Questions and concernsThe trial does of course raise questions and concerns. Is it possible, for instance, that the results were skewed by greater condom use in the group that took the pill; and won’t such findings encourage some men to dispense with condoms altogether in favour of a drug?There is also the issue of prohibitive cost of Truvada, which retails in the US for around $36 a day, and which makes the drug unaffordable to many possible users.Dr Fauci argues that the two groups were fully randomised and says that drugs can only play a complementary role in the war on HIV. Condoms and fewer partners, he said, remain the first line of defence.“We’re hoping that if this does become a useable tool in prevention, then the associated counselling will complement the effect of the drug and stop people becoming cavalier about it and say ‘now I have a pill I don’t have to worry’.“That’s exactly the opposite of what we want to happen. We want to add something rather than have it replace something.”Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, called the trial results “potentially significant”.“It’s vital that we expand the ways we can prevent HIV transmission, particularly amongst those most at risk,” he said in a statement. “This trial proves that HIV treatment will have an impact on prevention, but that it’s not ready for widespread use yet.“Three major hurdles are still going to be its cost, the risks of drug-resistant strains of HIV developing and taking a drug treatment every day.” _____________________ Source: BBC  Post Views:  597","['men', 'results', 'infection', 'pill', 'drug', 'greatly', 'hiv', 'trial', 'reduce', 'risk', 'study', 'used']","A drug used to treat HIV-positive patients may offer gay and bisexual men some protection against contracting the virus, the authors of a new study say.

I use, sell and buy heroin now, this is what I am doing as my business now”.At Kabul Drugs dealers and users are based at Bagh-E-Ali Mardan, Pul-E-Sukhta and at some others locations. They have also built their own living spaces at the desiccated parts of Kabul ’s river. That is where they cover their faces with scarfs, using drugs and sleeping on top of garbage.Murad Khani Bridge is just about a Kilometer away from the presidential palace, last year few addicted were flood-died here.One of the drug user’s brother Zabiullah says: “He has treated his brother several time but he is reusing, while he sees others using it and it’s also very easy to find.” He was criticizing the government for not being so active to prevent drugs’ deals in the city.Dr. Tawfiq Mashal, Director of Drug Prevention Ministry of Public Health says: “They have 105 drug users’ treatment centers countrywide and 28 out of those are located in Kabul .

Second 8,000 are using injections and out of the eight thousands 2,000 share injections witch is the key reason for HIV transmitting.”She says: “7% of those drugs users who are using and sharing injections are affected by HIV at Kabul , Heart and Mazar-E-Shrif provinces.”She further adds: “Base on a research 10% out of around one millions addicted have access to drugs users’ treatment centers and 2.3% of under age 15 are addicted to opium.”During a ribbon cutting ceremony held a while ago at Jangalak area of Kabul for a 300 beds refurbished drug addicted treatment Center . Kareem Khalili the voice president of the country called youths’ addication a silent tsunami.Numbers of drugs’ addicted are now under treatment in this center and Sarfarz from Helmand is one of them who had no other option but to come to the treatment center.He adds: “being under treatment in the center has given him a new life.”I left Jangalak to a privet addicted treatment center (Nejat). When I moved in to the building, I heard noise coming out of a room, and noticed that someone is singing and others are clapping for. When I moved closer the singer was singing (oh youth, oh youth, stop using drugs, if there are no youths who will be building this country) some of them ware clapping and the others were dancing.Talking to one of them who was pretty happy with the center’s services, Doctors’ and trainers’ behaviors.“Now if I became sad, I am not heading to back drugs I am staying here for entertaining and learning some skills.” Said Peer Dil. The Doctor incharge of the center Tariq Sulaiman says. “We are not only treating the addicted but teaching them some vocational skills as well, and then sending them back to their families.”Dr. Tariq added. “We have even recruited some of the addicted after curing in the center but the most important thing before the treatment is good behaviors to win their hearts.”The Ministry of Labors, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MoLSAMD) authorities say: “The Ministry has brought together 943 drugs users since last year by 9 drugs users collecting campaigns. They either have been send back to their families or have been introduced to vocational institutes for training”.According to Dr. Inayatullah Mayel the Executive Director of National Skills Development Program (NSDP), there are lots of requests and expectations with limited availabilities.Eng.

People have been beating them, throwing stone at them and insulting them.Gul Mohammad is complaining from his family and Says: “Before being addicted I was well respected at home, whenever I would have not liked the food already prepared at home I reject eating it and was asking my mom for a different kinds of food and she was serving it me.”“Since I’ve been using drugs no one from my family is treating me as a human being” Said Gul Mohammad.Professor Sharafuddin Azimi, lecturer of Psychology Faculty at Kabul University says. “Drug Users are sick, the need to be well treated by their family and if we want them to stop using drugs we should treat them with love.”Mohammad Hotak, had used heroin for 10 years and now he is not using it anymore and requesting the others addicted to quit using drugs because drugs disrespects peoples’ personalities among friends, families and in the society. According to Hotak, they should just come up with a strong plan and must go to the treatment center to stop using drugs.A UNODC research indicates 154000 hectares arable land estimated in 2012 for poppy cultivation and it has increased to 18% compared to the last year. 95% of poppies cultivation took place at insecure southern 9 provinces of the country.  The research also shows that 64% of the world’s poppy cultivation in 2012 has took place in Afghanistan .Note: addicted people interviewed are between ages 20 – 35 years.Tandi Sangi by Noor Gul Shafaq-Kabul for RFE/RL  Post Views:  254","['drugs', 'drug', 'youth', 'treatment', 'addiction', 'using', 'kabul', 'production', 'addicted', 'grows', 'heroin', 'parallel', 'users', 'opium', 'afghanistan']","As Noor, nearly one million youth in Afghanistan have lit fire to their lives being addicted to Heroin, Opium and to others drugs.

"From China to Singapore, a good girl in bad business",The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Ahmad Shah Ghanizada,2014-06-02T18:12:29+00:00,"Mirwais Jalazai – SingaporeShe calls herself Jia Wang; pimps and customers call her so.“I serve the low and the medal class,” said the round-faced blonde with gray eyes. “If the guys have money, they can have me for a night or an hour.” Depending on the nature of the service, her rates range from $ 50 to $ 70 for an hour.Though women of other nationalities, including Vietnam, Thailand and Sri Lankans, still lead the successful sex trade in Singapore, Wang said Chinese like her had pushed many of them out of business.Jia which means (good) in Chinese language said a country woman named Wen Won, who worked as a prostitute in Geylang  and Orchard rood two  famous red light areas in Singapore, encouraged her to join the field.On Orchard road, the success story of Singaporeans’ development, in a half dark café, In a pinky sexy short, with a half naked body Jia is completely covered by cigarettes smoke.“My first customer paid me SGD 250 to accompany him overnight. He even took me on a night tour of Santosa.  The following customers were not as good as him. They treated me like a tool to satisfy their sexual desires and that made me feel terrible,” she said.She said her last customer paid her  just to chat with her, saying that he wanted to gather information to write a book. “He gave me a book and advised me to quit the job. I couldn’t control myself and started crying,” she said.“I told him that I’m ‘too dirty’ now and that my future is already gone,” she said.Today is international sex workers’ day – a day to bring attention to the more than often exploitative conditions that those working in the industry have to face.What’s the best way to protect sex workers and prevent sexual exploitation that is a question which is very hard to governments to answer it.According to the international labor organization ( ILO) annually the income from forced labors reached the level of  $ 150 billion . And prostitution business has a oily  part in that income.ILO says that $150 billion in profits by 21 million forced laborers around the world. You have many countries in the world, whose population and GDP do not even match these figures. We are talking about a vast nation of hidden people about whom we are not talking enough and about whom the time has come to take strong action.Jia Wong is also a member of this huge family which is involved in prostitution business in that part of the world. She said she was misused by  others and now she is victim of that business and doesn’t know how to leave that field .She said she began regretting her act and she was worried that she might be infected with HIV because she said before I start that business I had no  idea what is HIV and how dangerous is it for our life.As a journalist when I first came to Singapore, I was a bit confused about prostitution. I thought it was illegal based on what little I knew about coming here.We heard that Singapore has a strong government; I assumed it would be tightly controlled. However, after just a few weeks of living here and driving around at night, I soon learned the truth. Even the government is not care about how the young generation of this county is going to be in contact with HIV infected girls from poor south eastern Asian countries.“The government of Singapore, a  country which means the country of lion knows that, they are lions they want to do business and attract more tourist to this country” she said.There is dozens of prostitutes from several souths eastern countries in that read light district in Singapore this night, but nobody knows exactly how many chine’s women like  Jia  have been sold into sexual slavery.Some girls like Jia are cheated by pimps and sold to traffickers. Others are abducted, raped and psychologically pummeled into submission.As music blared from the loudspeakers in the dimly-lit cafe in Gylang area Jia’s cell phone rang.  Her response was short and straight,  (SHEDA SHEDA)“Yes, yes, I’m coming.” She stopped smoking cigarette and got up.  She had a customer to attend to, and a taxi was waiting in front of cafe.  I followed her outside, and before she left, one last question of mine was, did you want to leave your profession? The answer came, wrapped in loud laughter: “Never it is  my business now”.

Afghanistan: quite off track of MDGs,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Khaama Press,2015-07-04T10:08:29+00:00,"Author: Ghulam Rasool Folladwand2015 is an important year and full of agendas for those who are dealing with development issues: in July world leaders are gathering in Addis Ababa to discuss new financing for development and constitute the implementation of post 2015 development agenda, more importantly in September the new Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are going to be discussed and agreed in New York. Addis gathering is to track progress made in the implementation of Monterrey and Doha Declarations, addressing the current international development cooperation landscape and reinvigorate the process of financing for development[i].  The eight MDGs were set in 2001 with ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015 but all goals does not seems to be reachable except poverty which is somehow mainly due to China’s fabulous growth. It’s not clear yet either will be more goals included or will it remain the same but, circumstances in the world has much worsened than before, considering the fact the past problems are still in its place, world is less peaceful and much insecure than before while climate change and its side effects is appearing stronger than ever.New York will host one of its important gathering this September. MDGs are eight in numbers starting from eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, to universal access to primary education, promote gender equality & women empowerment, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, environmental sustainability and global partnership for development  followed by subsequent targets and indicators. Governance might emerge a new insertion in the New MGDs; in respect to the context of Afghanistan security and measures to improve the security situation has already been marked by United National Development Program as MDG9[ii]. After major withdrawal of International troops lead by United States, despite 350,000 Afghan armed forces, the country is experiencing deteriorate security situation mainly threaten by Taliban and newly arisen Islamic State branch in Afghanistan. Future is very unclear and nobody knows what new measures and how will it contribute to bring peace in the territory. A part from that, sustainability in financing those forces in a country with 35% poverty rate and hugely dependent to international aid is a matter of concern. Government has a large deficit and can only finance 60% of its operational budget, the rest 40 and the entire development budget is on the shoulder of donors while donors, mainly westerns are scrimmaging with the aftershocks of devastating 2008 financial crisis.PovertyDespite the fact that for the past decade Afghanistan was the core of international donors allocation, poverty still remained very high and a major challenge ahead. According to World Bank estimates, approximately 35% of population or over 10 million Afghans are not able to meet their basic needs. Considering the extreme poverty exist there, the country spends half of its budget to its military with rising questions on military contracts with corruption. Afghan president Ashraf Ghani who served as senior World Bank advisor, in a recent memo a part from welcoming Ramadan, he is seriously concerned for this poor country and its huge military spending. War and military spending will cause not to pay attention to poverty and exclusion which are the main enemy of Afghans.Looking to the rough figures on poverty it requires that measures should be doubled in order to half extreme poverty but that’s not the case, situation is getting worse than ever before, donors increasingly cutting funds, hundreds of projects are closed and people are losing their jobs.  This has caused thousands of more people to drop under poverty line.There has always been lack of data in almost every sector in Afghanistan but in the job market each opening viewed by more than thousands of applicants looking for job. According to Afghan Journalist Shahhussain Murtazawi, for the recent 38 new openings in the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) over than 6,000 candidates have filled job application form.The economic growth has sharply and largely slowed down. World Bank recent reports states that growth declined from an average of 9 percent during 2003-2012 to 3.7 percent in 2013 and 2 percent in 2014 which is mostly the result of protracted political transition in 2014 and slow pace of reforms. The report furthered, “the growth outlook for 2015 remains weak: unfavourable weather conditions for agriculture production and lagged effects from last year could continue to undermine economic recovery.”The so called “political transition” has had devastating prices for Afghans; according to ex-authorities of Ministry of Finance; election and political transition caused $5 billion loses for the economy and $6 billion capital flown out in 2014. That’s still going on and is a situation of extreme stress it will very soon change to crisis if there not enough attention paid by the players.EducationIn each conference one of the most flourished parade exercised every time by both international community and Afghan government is education. Over the past decade significant achievements have been made. According to statistics released by Ministry of Education more than 8 million children are enrolled at schools of which girl’s enrolment rate which was almost zero in 2001 reached to 42%.  The figures have been questioned by new Minister of Education in a parliament session and by US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John F. Sopko in a letter to USAID Afghanistan stating that former authorities in the Ministry of Education provided false data to the government and donors claiming more schools in the country than what actually is the case in order to obtain more funds.  But this is not the first time, United Nation Office on Drug and Crime in a joint research with Afghanistan High Office of Oversight and Anticorruption titled “Corruption in Afghanistan” declared that the cost of corruption reached to $3.9 billion in 2012 of which most of them are paid in bribe in health and education sectors.School enrolment rate for girls reached 42% since 2001.Statistics are moving quite well, in Kabul the capital city hundred of private education centres are established. Jogging around in the streets you would probably end up in almost each street signboards tagged X and Y institute providing education services to pupils. But less attention has been paid to quality. Private education centres are less controlled, less organized, strict and standard roles about didactic materials does not exist, generally speaking it looks more an earning money business as Hamid Karzai ex-president pointed out “In Britain, the United States, India and elsewhere, private education standards are very high. The same level of standards can also be achieved in Afghanistan but unfortunately right now some of these institutions are only there to earn money.” [iii] He furthered “Dear brothers and elders, who have opened institutes for personal gain and business, please go and earn your money by other means, but don’t dupe our children with bogus certificates.”As the president and the kind of authorities he had this is not supposed to be the way to act, he could set very strict rules targeting quality in the education sector; those who are fit could have stayed, and the rest had to be taken out. This does not need funds or advisors: it can be done within his team in few months but nobody did it.Afghans are hungry for education, last year over 246,000 pupils registered for kankor exams whom only 54% (117,000) have been accepted in higher education institutions mainly due to lack of capacity. For the rest and majority (56%) seems nobody cares about. this is fundamentally important and has to be paid attention to otherwise could be a driven force towards more insurgency in this fragile situation and might easily be recruited in this particular circumstances where ISIS is recruiting in the country. Despite significant progress access to education still remained very low; approximately 42% of 12 million school aged children do not have access to education.Literacy rate still remained lower comparing to other countries in the region (38.2%) where female are considered the lowest.  Over five thousand schools have no usable building or retaining walls while 73% of teachers lack the minimum required qualification of grade 14 graduations which is a need of professional development. A lot has been done but still dozens of challenges exist.Global Partnership for DevelopmentAfghanistan with the strong support of international community in particular United States has managed to establish a unique partnership with donors in the last decade. The peculiarity of this partnership and its uniquety would not be easy to find example in the whole history of the country, or to exaggerate a bit “even in the world”. Looking to the trends of leading donors from 2002 to 2014 Afghanistan remained a high priority in their foreign policy and development assistance. According to recent SIGAR quarterly report to US congress published in April, the United States had appropriated approximately $109.78 billion for relief and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan since fiscal year (FY) 2002, followed by Japan, Germany, Britain and multilateral institution as World Bank, European Commission and Asian Development Bank as major contributors. SIGAR come out with another calculation stating that this money is more than what US provided for Europe after World War II as Marshal Plan. It looks a bit puzzling but considering all other factors constant, the money in terms of its real value is more than what had been provided to the whole Western Europe.The contribution and generosity of donors and tax payers has to be well appreciated, off course, they did fabulous jobs and undertook many sacrifices that cost them money and lives. But the aid has been less effective in terms of Aid Effectiveness Principles agreed in Paris as Paris Declaration (2005). According to Oxfam Facts on Aid to Afghanistan 2008[iv], “an estimated 40% of aid goes back to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries, profit margins on reconstruction contracts for international and Afghan contractor companies are often 20% and can be as high as 50%, most full time expatriate consultants working in private consulting companies cost $250,000– $500,000 a year and, over half of aid is tied requiring the procurement of donor-country goods and services.”Now the scenario has changed a lot, in a full collaboration Afghan government and International Community following the two conferences in Kabul and London(The Kabul Process) has created 21 National Priority Programs (NPPs) in five clusters[v]: Security, Governance, Human Resource Development, Agriculture and Rural Development, Infrastructure Development and, Private Sector Development with a particular monitoring mechanism managed by government and International community through JCMB(Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board) chaired by United Nation Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).At this time where almost all procedures, better and transparent mechanisms are in place, unfortunately funds are diminished huge which made the situation tougher than it is. In the case of US for 2014, Lawmakers allocated $1.1 billion for assistance to Afghanistan, the 50 percent of the $2.1 billion Obama administration sought, which would have kept spending at the same level as last year. In the case of US assistance to Afghanistan a sudden 50% reduction is a shock!! It came mainly due to refusal of signing Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) by Ex-president Hamid Karzai that would keep US troops and funding in Afghanistan beyond 2014.The ups and down in the relationship with the United States and ex-president Karzai  has cost the country a lot: international community were left in a situation of unknown and the funding which supposed to approved by their parliaments were left as draft papers, as a result most of the development projects stopped, thousands lost their jobs, billions of dollars out flowed to gulf countries and the country and people were left in a situation of stress and extremely concerned which further tracked off the country to achieve its targets in Millennium Development Goals.[i] http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/[ii] http://www.af.undp.org/content/afghanistan/en/home/mdgoverview/[iii] http://www.afghanistan-today.org/en/articles/society/126/[iv] https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/ACBAR_aid_effectiveness_paper_0803.pdf[v] http://www.thekabulprocess.gov.af/index.php/clusters–npps  Post Views:  147","['quite', 'education', 'country', 'world', 'united', 'situation', 'track', 'development', 'poverty', 'mdgs', 'international', 'donors', 'afghanistan']","Addis gathering is to track progress made in the implementation of Monterrey and Doha Declarations, addressing the current international development cooperation landscape and reinvigorate the process of financing for development[i].

"10,500 people die from tuberculosis every year in Afghanistan",The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Administrator,2012-12-03T16:08:36+00:00,"By: Ahmad MasoudAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 53,000 people contract tuberculosis (TB) every year in Afghanistan. The available figures indicate that 66 percent of new cases are women and 10 percent are children.WHO has said that more than 670 children younger than 15 were diagnosed with TB last year in Afghanistan and, of those, the majority of the cases, 465, were girls.The Afghan Ministry of Public Health has reported that nearly 10,500 people die from TB each year in the country and nearly 650 children succumbed to the disease last year.Experts believe that poor working and living conditions, poverty, traditional beliefs, lack of awareness about the disease, security, lack of access to proper medications and health facilities for an earlier diagnosis of the disease and intervention are among the reasons for the high incidence of tuberculosis.The internationally-recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS), which is believed to be the most efficient and cost-effective tuberculosis control strategy, has been used in Afghanistan with some success.The implementation of DOTS requires sustained political and financial commitment to ensure that there can be: diagnosis by quality ensured sputum-smear microscopy; standardized short-course anti-TB treatment (SSC) given under direct and supportive observation (DOT); a regular, uninterrupted supply of high quality anti-TB drugs; and a standardized recording and reporting mechanism.According to available figures, the percentage of people with access to DOTS in Afghanistan has increased from 14 to 97 percent since 2002 and the number of health facilities which apply DOTS has increased from 10 in 2000 to nearly 1,200 in 2011.Based on the DOTS successes, the WHO developed a six-point ‘Stop TB Strategy’ to address the key challenges faced by TB worldwide. The main purpose of the strategy is to lessen the global TB burden by 2015 and ensure that all TB patients and those co-infected with HIV and drug-resistant TB take advantage of universal access to high-quality diagnosis and patient-centred treatment.The six-point ‘Stop TB Strategy’ includes sustaining, improving and accelerating quality DOTS expansion; addressing TB-HIV, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and other special challenges; contributing to health system strengthening; engaging all care providers; empowering patients and communities; and enabling and promoting research.Keeping in mind the current threat posed by TB in Afghanistan, experts suggest that more priority should be given to a carefully-designed national TB communication strategy based on the six-point ‘Stop TB Strategy’ in Afghanistan. The communication objective should be clear whether it wants to raise awareness about the danger of TB; promote TB safe behaviour among those who are aware of the dangers of TB or promote TB safe behaviour among a group of people who are at particular risk.The comprehensive communication strategy needs to be based on the results of  well designed research, using Knowledge, Attitude, Practices and Beliefs (KAPB), Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) research methods.Specials attention should be given to rural areas where the majority of the population live and where the level of understanding of TB is very low. An overall majority of people in Afghanistan do not know the early signs and symptoms of TB and think that it is an incurable disease.Meanwhile, any research to be conducted in the country will need to pay special attention to women and girls who make up the majority of the TB cases in Afghanistan and are traditionally responsible, in certain parts of the country, for working in some unhygienic environments such as stables, pens, backyards, and collecting and bringing home firewood, bushes and animal droppings. They are also responsible for cooking, washing and taking care of other household chores and all these could make them more prone to the disease.Despite TB eradication efforts, Afghanistan has remained one of the 22 TB high-burden countries in the world. The alarming figures indicate that Afghanistan has a long way to go before getting rid of this preventable disease.

"Girl, 8, married to 12-year-old boy against $2000 in Balkh",The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Ahmad Shah Ghanizada,2014-08-31T04:20:28+00:00,"By: Mirwais JalalzaiAt age 8, Mina married to 12 -year-old Sardar in a rural village, making her only one of more than 10 million underage girls who are being forced to wed worldwide.The secret wedding ceremony of Mina and Sardar took place in Sholgara district of northern Balkh province in the border with Tajikistan.Child marriages, which are currently, practiced in several third world countries including Afghanistan, the government passed strong resolution to stop this phenomenon. United Nations designated October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child to forced governments to take strong steps against child marriage.Last night Afghan media broadcast series of heart-breaking photos depicting girl as young as eight years old being married off to a underage boy .In the district of Sholgara of Balkh province, a father named Abdul Momin gave away his eight-year-old daughter Mina to wed a 12-year old boy because he could not support having his daughter live with him.According to reports the groom family paid 2000 USD to bride’s father as the girl’s price (Mahar).Afghan experts agree that early marriage prevents the girls from education opportunities and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by growing responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household.Mina, the 8-year-old bride from Balkh province who was married off on Friday, was forced to drop out of school, giving up on her dream of becoming a teacher one day.In several part of Afghanistan fathers often remove their daughter from school even before they are engaged to limit their interactions with boys.In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse.The local Mula Imam (religious leader) who was attended in Nekah ceremony said both families mutually agree and enter into this contract; both bride and groom have the liberty to define various terms and conditions of their liking and make them a part of this contract.“There is no ban for under age marriage in special conditions in Islam” he said.The forced marriages of girls to under or middle-aged men are not only common in Afghanistan, but also other countries like India and Ethiopia (South-Asia and sub-Saharan Africa more broadly).Every year, 10 million girls around the world are forced into marriage before they turn 18.Girls who marry young – as well as missing out on education – are more likely to suffer poverty, domestic violence, malnutrition, maternal and infant death, obstetric fistula and HIV infection.Mina  was just a little girl. She probably enjoyed playing outside with her siblings. She probably loved her parents – and did not understand why they sold her into marriage. A marriage that turned out to be her death, and at best would have still meant the end of her life as she knew it.Almost 39,000 girls around the world face the same possible fate as Mina every single day. That’s 39,000 tragic weddings that are far from a fairy tale.Although child marriage is against the law in many countries even in Afghanistan, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimates that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret.In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 per cent of girls wed before the legal age of 16 according to UN investigations.

World Population Tops 7 Billion,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Administrator,2011-10-30T15:51:59+00:00,"KABUL, 31 October 2011 – The United Nations has predicted that the world population will reach 7 billion today. This global milestone is both a great opportunity and a great challenge.The challenges confronting humanity as the world’s population reaches 7 billion are presented in a new report by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund launched worldwide on October 26th.The State of World Population 2011: People and possibilities in a world of 7 billion shows that actions we take today could determine whether world population will grow to 10 billion or 16 billion by the end of the century, and could ensure that our future is more equitable and environmentally sustainable.“With planning and the right investment in people now – to empower them to make choices that are not only good for themselves, but also for our global commons – our world of 7 billion can have thriving sustainable cities, productive labour forces that fuel economies, and youth populations that contribute to the well-being of their societies,” says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin in the foreword of the report.This year’s State of World Population report, People and Possibilities in a World of 7 Billion, looks at the dynamics behind the numbers. It explains the trends that are defining our world of 7 billion and documents actions that people in vastly different countries and circumstances are taking in their own communities to make the most of their–and our–world. It is mainly a report from the field, where demographers, policymakers, governments, civil society and individuals are grappling with population trends ranging from ageing to rapidly rising numbers of young people, from high population growth rates to shrinking populations, and from high rates of urbanization to rising international migration. The countries featured in this report are China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, India, Mexico, Mozambique, Nigeria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.The State of World Population 2011 report shows that the issue of population is a question of human equity and opportunity more than space.While our world of 7 billion presents a complex picture of trends and paradoxes, there are some essential global truths the report observed. It is relevant to note that educating and empowering girls and women allow them to have fewer children than their mothers and grandmothers did, and they choose this path whenever and wherever they can. It is also generally observed that boys and men must be consistently involved, for they are the critical partners for health and development.UNFPA Report states that additional investments in youth are needed. Of the world’s 7 billion, 1.8 billion are young people between the ages of 10 and 24. As parents and teachers of the next generation, their choices will determine future population trends. Investing in the health and education of youth would yield enormous returns in economic growth and development for generations to come.“In Afghanistan people less than 25 years old make up almost 70 percent of the total population. Investing in adolescent girls is one of the smartest investments a country can make. With health, education and opportunities, girls and women can contribute fully to their societies and help break the cycle of poverty. To celebrate the 7 billion possibilities behind the 7 billion people of this world, UNFPA stands close to Afghan women’s right to a safe and healthy motherhood”, said Arie Hoekman, UNFPA Afghanistan Representative.The report includes selected demographic, social and economic indicators monitoring the progress made on the internationally agreed upon goals during the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, Egypt – September 1994).Population dynamics in Afghanistan are described by the following numbers:–          population growth 3.1%–          urban population 23%–          total fertility rate 6.0–          life expectancy at birth for male and female is 49–          population using an improved sanitation facility 37%–          maternal mortality 1400 per 100,000 live births–          births attended by skilled health personnel 14%–          contraceptive prevalence rate any method 23%, modern method 15%UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is an international development agency that promotes the right of every woman, man and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity. UNFPA supports countries in using population data for policies and programmes to reduce poverty and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV/AIDS, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect.End The full report is available on line:http://www.unfpa.org/swp  Post Views:  131","['world', 'tops', 'billion', 'report', 'population', 'young', 'health', 'trends', 'youth', 'united', 'unfpa']","KABUL, 31 October 2011 – The United Nations has predicted that the world population will reach 7 billion today.

UNODC chief met President Karzai on counter-narcotics action,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Sajad,2012-05-29T16:32:50+00:00,"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) following a press release on Tuesday announced, Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of UNODC and Afghan President Hamid Karzai today discussed plans to boost national and regional counter-narcotics efforts, as well as ways to stem drug production.The source further added, stressing the principle of “shared responsibility” as the only effective answer to the global menace of Afghan opiates, Mr. Fedotov highlighted that the Afghan Government and provincial governors had a crucial role to play. Strong, sustained political will at all levels of the Afghan leadership would be an essential part of the solution.Mr. Fedotov said, “I welcome the fact that the government is working hard to counter the narcotics trade in the country, but there is also a need to do much more. We must build the necessary political commitment, as well as practical action, to have tangible successes against the criminal networks that traffic in death and misery.”Afghanistan produces some 90 per cent of the world’s illicit opiates. The UNODC Afghan Opium Survey 2011 pointed to a dramatic 133 per cent increase in the farm-gate value of opium compared with 2010, higher prices for the crop and a flourishing drugs trade.Having launched a new Country Programme for Afghanistan (2012-2014) while in Kabul, Mr. Fedotov assured President Karzai that his Office remained committed to ensuring continued and tailored support to Afghanistan.

Its focus would primarily be on providing alternative livelihoods to households dependent on illicit crop cultivation; drug demand reduction; and drug-related HIV prevention and treatment.Simultaneously, the Country Programme would contribute to the wider objectives of the Regional Programme for Afghanistan and Neighbouring Countries 2011-14, a strategic framework for UNODC and multilateral partners to respond effectively to drug trafficking and organized crime.
