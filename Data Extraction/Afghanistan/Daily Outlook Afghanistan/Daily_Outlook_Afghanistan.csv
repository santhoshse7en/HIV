HIV: Life expectancy and outlook,There is no set length of time that a person can live with HIV. Life expectancy increases as new treatments become available. People can now manage HIV as a chronic condition. Learn more here.,,None,"The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years. Thanks to advances in treatment, namely antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV can now expect to live long, healthy lives.

When the HIV and AIDS epidemic began in the United States in the 1980s, HIV was a life-threatening condition. However, people can now manage it as a chronic health condition, much like they would diabetes or heart failure.

In this article, we examine developments in managing and treating HIV, as well as the long-term outlook.

Recent improvements



Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy has increased life expectancy for people living with HIV.

The increase in life expectancy for people living with HIV has direct links to improvements in medical therapy, which includes antiretroviral medications.

These medications help suppress levels of HIV in the blood and slow damage resulting from the infection. This suppression helps prevent progression from HIV to AIDS, or stage 3 HIV.

In the 1980s–1990s, antiretroviral therapy began as monotherapy, then it became dual therapy. Now, there is combination antiretroviral therapy, which includes using three or more drugs.

There are several classes of antiretroviral drugs that attack HIV in different ways. Combinations of drugs are the first-line treatment. People typically start antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV.

A 2017 study in the journal AIDS found that the additional life expectancy for people with HIV at age 20 during the early monotherapy era was 11.8 years. However, that number rose to 54.9 years for the most recent combination antiretroviral era.

Researchers also concluded that people with HIV with higher education had a similar life expectancy to the general population.

Future treatment options



Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection. Cardiovascular disease is becoming common in people with long-standing HIV infection.

Researchers continue to work on a cure for HIV. In the meantime, combination antiretroviral therapy preserves the health of a person with HIV. It does this by suppressing the virus in the blood to undetectable levels. It is important for the person to follow their therapy plan precisely.

In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now report that when a person taking antiretroviral therapy has a negative viral load in their blood, the risk of transmitting the virus to a person without HIV is essentially zero.

This discovery takes researchers to a notion of ""treatment as prevention,"" which promotes well-controlled HIV as a way to prevent transmission through sexual contact, needle sharing, and childbirth and breastfeeding.

Because people with HIV are living much longer, they are starting to face the same health issues as other older adults.

In fact, differentiating Alzheimer's disease from HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders is becoming an emerging issue in the population of older adults living with HIV.

Even with the advances in antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV may experience long-term side effects of either the therapy or HIV itself.

Conditions common in long-standing HIV infection include:

cardiovascular disease

lung disease

certain cancers

HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders

liver disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C

HIV also appears to increase chronic inflammation in the body, putting a person at risk of certain health conditions. However, more research is necessary to better understand this.

Antiretroviral medications have links to both short- and long-term side effects. Most side effects are manageable but can become serious. A person should speak with their healthcare provider about side effects that are of any concern.

Long-term effects from antiretrovirals can include:

kidney failure

liver failure

heart disease

type 2 diabetes

high blood cholesterol levels

lipodystrophy, or changes in how the body stores fat

osteoporosis

neuropathy

Outlook



A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider. A person with HIV should work closely with their healthcare provider.

Life expectancy for people living with HIV has seen great improvement in recent years. In fact, a person who currently has HIV can expect to add many years to their life once they start combination antiretroviral treatment.

A 2017 study in the journal HIV Medicine indicates that a person with HIV living in a high-income country would add 43.3 years to their life expectancy if they receive a diagnosis at age 20.

Without adequate treatment, however, HIV can quickly start to damage cells in the immune system.

It is important for a person living with HIV to stick to their treatment plan to keep the virus suppressed in the blood. It is also essential for the person to work closely with their healthcare providers on a regular basis and maintain all other aspects of their health and well-being.","['health', 'treatment', 'hiv', 'life', 'living', 'effects', 'outlook', 'antiretroviral', 'person', 'expectancy', 'therapy']","The life expectancy of a person living with HIV has improved dramatically over recent years.

HIV/AIDS - Symptoms and causes,,,2018-01-19 00:00:00,"Overview

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). By damaging your immune system, HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight the organisms that cause disease.

HIV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). It can also be spread by contact with infected blood or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding. Without medication, it may take years before HIV weakens your immune system to the point that you have AIDS.

There's no cure for HIV/AIDS, but there are medications that can dramatically slow the progression of the disease. These drugs have reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations.

Symptoms

The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection.

Primary infection (Acute HIV)

Most people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within a month or two after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary or acute HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. Possible signs and symptoms include:

Fever

Headache

Muscle aches and joint pain

Rash

Sore throat and painful mouth sores

Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck

These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.

Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV)

In some people, persistent swelling of lymph nodes occurs during this stage. Otherwise, there are no specific signs and symptoms. HIV remains in the body and in infected white blood cells.

This stage of HIV infection generally lasts around 10 years if you're not receiving antiretroviral therapy. But sometimes, even with this treatment, it lasts for decades. Some people develop more severe disease much sooner.

Symptomatic HIV infection

As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:

Fever

Fatigue

Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection

Diarrhea

Weight loss

Oral yeast infection (thrush)

Shingles (herpes zoster)

Progression to AIDS

Thanks to better antiviral treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 10 years.

When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers — diseases that wouldn't usually trouble a person with a healthy immune system.

The signs and symptoms of some of these infections may include:

Soaking night sweats

Recurring fever

Chronic diarrhea

Persistent white spots or unusual lesions on your tongue or in your mouth

Persistent, unexplained fatigue

Weight loss

Skin rashes or bumps

When to see a doctor

If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a health care provider as soon as possible.

Causes

HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact or blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast-feeding.

How does HIV become AIDS?

HIV destroys CD4 T cells — white blood cells that play a large role in helping your body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.

You can have an HIV infection for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have an AIDS-defining complication.

How HIV spreads

To become infected with HIV, infected blood, semen or vaginal secretions must enter your body. This can happen in several ways:

By having sex. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.

Sharing contaminated intravenous drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis. During pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. HIV-positive mothers who get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.

How HIV doesn't spread

You can't become infected with HIV through ordinary contact. That means you can't catch HIV or AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.

HIV isn't spread through the air, water or insect bites.

Risk factors

When HIV/AIDS first appeared in the United States, it mainly affected men who had sex with men. However, now it's clear that HIV also spreads through heterosexual sex.

Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can be infected. However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you:

Have unprotected sex. Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is more risky than is vaginal sex. Your risk of HIV increases if you have multiple sexual partners.

People who use intravenous drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people's blood. Are an uncircumcised man. Studies suggest that lack of circumcision increases the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV.

Complications

HIV infection weakens your immune system, making you much more likely to develop numerous infections and certain types of cancers.

Infections common to HIV/AIDS

Tuberculosis (TB). In resource-limited nations, TB is the most common opportunistic infection associated with HIV. It's a leading cause of death among people with AIDS.

This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.

This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain.

Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Seizures occur when it spreads to the brain. Cryptosporidiosis. This infection is caused by an intestinal parasite that's commonly found in animals. You get it when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. The parasite grows in your intestines and bile ducts, leading to severe, chronic diarrhea in people with AIDS.

Cancers common to HIV/AIDS

Kaposi's sarcoma. A tumor of the blood vessel walls, this cancer is rare in people not infected with HIV, but common in HIV-positive people. It usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi's sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.

In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi's sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs. Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin.

Other complications

Wasting syndrome. Aggressive treatment approaches have reduced the number of cases of wasting syndrome, but it still affects many people with AIDS. It's defined as a loss of at least 10 percent of body weight, often accompanied by diarrhea, chronic weakness and fever.

Although AIDS doesn't appear to infect the nerve cells, it can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, forgetfulness, depression, anxiety and difficulty walking. One of the most common neurological complications is AIDS dementia complex, which leads to behavioral changes and reduced mental functioning.

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys that remove excess fluid and wastes from your blood and pass them to your urine. It most often affects blacks or Hispanics. Anyone with this complication should be started on antiretroviral therapy.

Prevention

There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.

HIV Transmission,Some questions and answers on how HIV is transmitted.,,None,"Some groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including the status of their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live.

When you live in a community where many people have HIV infection, the chances of having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV are higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis atlas to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different US communities. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different populations.

Gay and bisexual men have the largest number of new diagnoses in the United States. Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Also, transgender women who have sex with men are among the groups at highest risk for HIV infection, and injection drug users remain at significant risk for getting HIV.

Risky behaviors, like having anal or vaginal sex without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV, and sharing needles or syringes play a big role in HIV transmission. Anal sex is the highest-risk sexual behavior. If you don’t have HIV, being a receptive partner (or bottom) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for getting HIV. If you do have HIV, being the insertive partner (or top) for anal sex is the highest-risk sexual activity for transmitting HIV.

But there are more tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors, taking medicines to prevent and treat HIV, and using condoms with lubricants are all highly effective ways to reduce the risk of getting or transmitting HIV. Learn more about these and other strategies to prevent HIV.

"5,900 People Infected with  HIV/AIDS in Afghanistan",News: Statistics by Ministry of Public  Health show that 28 people died due to HIV/AIDS last year.<br>   Officials from the Ministry of  Public Health...,Daily Outlook Afghanistan,"March 11, 2019","Statistics by Ministry of Public  Health show that 28 people died due to HIV/AIDS last year.  Officials from the Ministry of  Public Health said their statistics show that 5,900 people have been diagnosed  positive with HIV/AIDS virus around the country.   The statistics were made public in  a meeting organized on the activities of the ministry, especially in prevention  of HIV/AIDS. The meeting was attended by the ministry’s officials and  representatives of international organizations.   Mamozai Zewar, the Deputy Minister  of Public Health, said that 28 people lost their lives due to HIV/AIDS  infection.   Herat, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Balkh  and Kunduz provinces have the highest number of HIV/AIDS patients.Â    “The number of people infected with  AIDS virus has reached to 5,900 people,” said Zewar.   He said they remain committed to fighting  the virus and helping those infected with HIV/AIDS.   An official from the World Health  Organization (WHO) said more works needed in fighting and preventing HIV  disease.  “In Afghanistan it is moving on the  right direction, however, more collective and consulted efforts have to be done  and it has to be done,” Merlyn, a representative from WHO said.   According to MoPH, currently, 4.4  percent of the addicts injects drugs into their bodies which transfer AIDS  virus from one person to another one. The officials said in the last 10 years  they have prevented the increase of injections among the addicts to prevent an  increase of HIV disease.   HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is  one of the world’s most serious public health challenges. But there a global  commitment to stopping new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living  with HIV has access to HIV treatment.  According to the Joint United  Nations Program on HIV/AIDS information on website of the organization, there  were approximately 36.9 million people worldwide living with HIV/AIDS in 2017.  Of these, 1.8 million were children (<15 years old).  An estimated 1.8 million  individuals worldwide became newly infected with HIV in 2017 â about 5,000 new  infections per day. This includes 180,000 children (<15 years). Most of  these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and were infected by their  HIV-positive mothers during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.  Approximately 75% of people living  with HIV globally were aware of their HIV status in 2017. The remaining 25%  (over 9 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. HIV testing  is an essential gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support  services.  AIDS-related deaths have been  reduced by more than 51% since the peak in 2004. In 2017, 940 000 people died  from AIDS-related illnesses worldwide, compared to 1.4 million in 2010 and 1.9  million in 2004.

Dramatic Increase in HIV/Aids,Opinion: Afghanistan is in the early stage of dramatic increase of HIV/AIDs while the main route of  transmission are reported needle sharing; Officials in the ministry of public health of Afghanistan...,Mohammad Zahir Akbari,"December 06, 2016","Afghanistan is in the early stage of dramatic increase of HIV/AIDs while the main route of  transmission are reported needle sharing; Officials in the ministry of public health of Afghanistan informed  of impressive increase in HIV/AIDS positive cases in the country. Deputy public  health minister Najia Tariq said on Sunday that the HIV/AIDS cases have  increased by 38 percent as compared to last year. She said at least 162 HIV/AIDS  positive cases have been recorded across the country during the current year, but  around 117 HIV positive cases were recorded last year. The World Health  Organization (WHO) estimates around 5,000 people are affected with HIV/AIDS  virus across the country, and only 30 percent of HIV positive cases have been  recorded so far whereas, historically, the first HIV positive case was recorded  in earlier in 1989.  In addition to damage of immune system, the HIV victims are  additionally damaged by mental trauma in traditional societies such as  Afghanistan. They may face with humiliating behavior or easily isolated by  their family and friends, or by their community. On the other hand, they face  with poor treatment in healthcare and educational settings. It all starts with  a sense of disbelief when tested positive and then the patient loses all hope,  leading to panic and fear. Many people living with HIV are at an increased risk  of developing mood swings, cognitive or anxiety disorders. These can severely  affect the nervous system.  In global level, the HIV/AIDS is not over but it can be if we  tailor the response to individual needs at particular times in life. According  to reports, there are about 78 million people who have become infected with HIV  and 35 million have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the first cases. The  number of new HIV infections has not declined specially among adults and young  women. The latest data by the WHO shows that there are 37 million people living  with the disease and only 18.2 million people are receiving antiretroviral  treatment worldwide.   Hence, there is serious need to raising awareness in order to  prevent the spread and pave the way for access to antiretroviral medicines. A  life-cycle approach to HIV that finds solutions for everyone at every stage of  life can address the complexities of HIV. Risks and challenges change as people  go through life, highlighting the need to adapt HIV prevention and treatment  strategies from birth to old age. Specially, those with positive results should  immediately seek help and confirm reports from health clinics. They also  require receiving information and links to counseling as well as rapid referral  to prevention, treatment and care services.   Luckily, The World Health Organization (WHO) issued new guidelines  on HIV self-testing to help with the diagnosis of the deadly disease. The  initiative by the UN health organization aims to help millions know about their  HIV status and get the right treatment. With the easy and pertinent  self-testing kit, people around the world can know about their status within  “20 minutes”. The WHO report says, “HIV self-testing means people can use oral  fluid or blood- finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient  setting.” the self-testing should open the door for many more people to know  about their HIV status and eventually lead the patients to find out how to get  treatment and access prevention services.   In addition, some scientists are informing about vaccines and new  methods of cure. A large-scale trial of a potential vaccine is underway in  South Africa. The study will involve more than 5,400 sexually active men and  women ages 18 to 35 in a number of areas around South Africa, a country where  more than 1,000 people a day are infected with HIV. The trial will last for  four years.  According to the latest WHO progress report, “lack of an HIV  diagnosis is a major obstacle to implementing the expert advices that everyone  with HIV should be offered antiretroviral therapy (ART).”Â    As Millions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving  treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others. The report shows  that 40 per cent of all people affected with the HIV-virus (over 14 million)  remain unaware of their status. “Many of these are people at higher risk of HIV  infection who often find it difficult to access existing testing services. Self-testing  is a best way to reach more people with undiagnosed HIV and represents a step  forward to empower individuals, diagnose people earlier before they become  sick, bring services closer to where people live, and create demand for HIV  testing. This is particularly important for those people facing barriers to  accessing existing services.  Even so 23 countries have national policies that support HIV  self-testing. Many others are developing policies, but wide-scale  implementation of HIV self-testing remains limited.Â  The alarming report also suggested that 70  per cent people whose partners are affected by the virus, they also test  positive to the test but many of those do not get tested to ascertain their  status. Finally, there are several factors and route in Afghanistan contributing  to the risk of a HIV epidemic, including economic, social, demographic, unwariness,  syringe sharing, unscreened emigrants or visitors and behavioural determinants  that, if not addressed effectively, may fuel the spread of HIV. In fact, there  is need to national strategy for prevention and fight against issue focusing on  certain effected groups such as IDUs, prisoners, foreign sex workers, emigrants  and visitors.","['health', 'treatment', 'report', 'hiv', 'positive', 'increase', 'selftesting', 'status', 'hivaids', 'million', 'cases', 'dramatic']","Afghanistan is in the early stage of dramatic increase of HIV/AIDs while the main route of transmission are reported needle sharing; Officials in the ministry of public health of Afghanistan informed of impressive increase in HIV/AIDS positive cases in the country.

HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Afghanistan,"Opinion: The Ministry of Health has reported that there are 1,327 cases of HIV AIDS registered in Afghanistan. Mostly an epidemic among drug users, 70 percent of them are males, 25 percent females, and five  ...",Abbas Daiyar,"December  04, 2012","The Ministry of Health has reported that there are 1,327 cases of HIV AIDS registered in Afghanistan. Mostly an epidemic among drug users, 70 percent of them are males, 25 percent females, and five percent are children. Majority of cases have been reported in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat provinces.   Worldwide, there are 34 million people suffering from HIV and 36 million patients have lost their lives. Around 95% of people with HIV/AIDS live in developing nations. Around half of the infected HIV people are killed by AIDS before they are 35.   Every year 1st December is marked as World AIDS Day since 1988. HIV infected people around the world are growing day by day despite the intense campaign to prevent it. Majority of infected people even do not know about the dangers they are faced with. Discrimination and stigma against HIV persons still prevails in countries with most HIV infected people.   Afghanistan is increasingly facing an HIV epidemic. Three decades of wars, mass exodus of refugees to Pakistan and Iran and now their return, illiteracy and lack of awareness, stigma and discrimination are the prime factors. The actual number of HIV infected people is far more than the official statistics of Health Ministry.   According to official records, the first HIV deaths were registered in May 2008 when a father and his two children passed away due to HIV. And 66 per cent HIV cases were due to used syringes. Official record from just one province, Kandahar, shows the number of infected has doubled. In 2011 there were 11 cases registered, which has increased to 22 this year. Among them, 18 were males and three females who contracted the virus from their husbands. A Health Ministry official from the province says four people had reached a critical stage while three have died. All of the infection has been caused by use of syringes by drug addicts.  The prevailing reasons behind the increasing HIV epidemic in Afghanistan is injected drug use, shared syringe and contaminated blood transfers. World Health Organization has already warned high levels of intravenous drug use and unsafe blood transfusions could cause rapid spread of HIV in Afghanistan. After three decades of conflict and war, a large number of Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan have repatriated. Reports suggest that a significant number of infections have been spread by those returning with HIV virus. For instance, recently 88 Afghan refugees in Peshawar city of Pakistan alone had tested positive for HIV including 10 women. The infected people are aged between 25 and 45 years.  There is not an effective program particularly designed for Afghans returning from Iran or Pakistan. The UN and Government needs to make a strategy in this regard.   Lack of awareness, stigma and discrimination against the AIDS infected people are also major factors behind the increasing epidemic. All these make Afghanistan fertile for HIV epidemic. Drug users and sex workers are the most vulnerable groups of HIV affected people in Afghanistan. Being the largest poppy producing country in the world, there is large number of people taking drug. Lack of awareness and knowledge about HIV prevention is a big threat in this regard as most of these peopleâsex workers and drug addictsâdo not know about the risks and causes of HIV.   According to MoPH, there are about 19000 drug addicts that use injection.  Illiteracy also creates much problem in this regard. Besides the spread of HIV, lack of awareness also causes discrimination and stigma against infected people.   Majority of infections are reported in urban areas, mostly capital Kabul, Heratâbordering IranâMazar and Kandahar cities. Though there have been many programs to increase awareness among the adult populations in these cities with primary knowhow about HIV AIDS, however, there is a general belief that the virus only spreads through sexual intercourse. Very few common people are aware that usage of injection syringe by more than a person and some other reasons can also cause spread of the virus.   Due to cultural and traditional barriers, people are often reluctant to even talk about such issues. This social behavior is a big hurdle towards generating awareness about HIV AIDs. NGOs working on the issue face such problems from community where they do not allow awareness campaigns to talk about safe sex or related issues.They would never like to send their adult daughters to such awareness programs. Other than that, a general religious misunderstanding and myth is common about HIV. Therefore, the most effective way to spread the word about HIV is to convince religious leaders (Mullahs) and community elders telling them about such serious issues.   Under the National AIDS Control Program Afghanistan National HIV/AIDS strategic Framework there are certain objectives for the Public Health Ministry. It aims at gaining political commitment and mobilizing resources necessary to implement the national HIV/AIDS/STI strategy.   Public awareness is the most effective way to generate awareness and prevent HIV epidemic. People from all walks of life are needed to play their due responsibility in this regard by spreading the word about the deadly HIV/AIDS.","['drug', 'health', 'aids', 'number', 'hiv', 'afghanistan', 'awareness', 'spread', 'hivaids', 'epidemic', 'infected']","Afghanistan is increasingly facing an HIV epidemic.

Where are the Nurses in the HIV Response?,"Opinion: Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, nurses  have been at the forefront of the response to this once fatal infection. The  nurse is involved at every stage of the trajectory ...",Ian Hodgson,"August 01, 2018","Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, nurses  have been at the forefront of the response to this once fatal infection. The  nurse is involved at every stage of the trajectory of a person living with  HIVâfrom usually being the first to counsel the newly diagnosed person, to one  of the last to be with him/her at the point of death.  This significant, albeit less recognized,  role played by nurses across the world in the care, support, and treatment of  people living with HIV (PLHIV) was the key theme of an important event hosted  by the US based Association of Nurses in AIDS Care (ANAC) at the recently  concluded 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) in Amsterdam,  Netherlands.  Nurses are the backbone of effective HIV  response  Nurses have always been the front and  centre of public health crises. In the most recent outbreak of Ebola during May  2018 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the first health professional to  die of the infection was a nurse. At the beginning of the HIV epidemic, nurses  provided the bulk of in-hospital care during the difficult pre-ART phases, and  though there are no recorded incidents of nurses catching HIV in the workplace,  there is an associated toll. Nurses can often be stigmatized because of their  place of work, and/or work alone in rural clinics with little support and the  expectation that they provide all the required care. Nurses also provide point  of care HIV tests, support people following a TB test, counsel pregnant young  women following a positive HIV diagnosis, and give immediate information about  treatment and lifestyle. Indeed, according to Carole Treston, Executive  Director of ANAC, nurses are in a prime position to be champions of human  rights, “stigma busters and discrimination fighters.”  Why are nurses absent from HIV policy  making?  Yet nurses are usually absent from  policy-making, and even the International AIDS Society has never had a nurse on  its board. Nurses do seek influence, not through hubris but rather a desire to  shape policy impacting directly on the lives of people affected by HIV. This is  something they have in common with civil society organisations, a cohort that  since the beginning of the HIV epidemic has become, and rightly so,  increasingly vocal and influential. But where are the nurses?  Often, they are simply too busy working at  the ground. Then again, in some areas of Africa and South America, for example,  nurses are routinely rotated around specialties, working as HIV nurses for only  a limited period of time and with little opportunity for career progression in  the field. There is also the question of gender, with female nurses less likely  to progress in countries where gender inequality is endemic and with  hierarchical health systems dominated by male doctors. This is perhaps the  reason ANAC and other HIV nursing associations find it difficult to reach out  and connect with nurses in eastern Europe and central Asia, where nurses are  relatively disempowered compared to the west. Nurses here are unlikely to reach  the levels of autonomy required for policy-making involvement and networking.  Heed nurses’ voices for effective HIV  responses  The aforesaid event considered a range of  options for nurses to be more influential in the HIV response. Shaun Watson,  currently chair of the UK’s national HIV nursing association, shared details  with CNS (Citizen News Service www.citizen-news.org) of the U=U campaign to  which an increasing numbers of nursing groups are signing up to, such as NHIVNA  (UK), the European HIV Nursing Network, and the Dutch HIV Nursing Association.  For Shaun Watson, “As the people who diagnose HIV, start treatment, monitor  adherence, listen to and manage concerns over symptoms and side effects, it  will be nurses at the forefront of the U=U campaign. The evidence is clear that  the risk of sexually passing on HIV when virally suppressed and engaged in care  is zero. This is an important message to get across not only to HIV nurses but  to every other nurse.”  Given the dominance of nurses in HIV care,  speaking the truth to those in power must be within their remit. Nurses should  not be afraid to raise their voices and be heard against the background of an  ever-increasing dominance of medicalisation and reliance on data gathering in  the HIV response. For Susan Strasser, Senior Implementation Director of ICAP’s  global portfolio of public health programmes at Columbia University, the  epidemic control of HIV will “only be achieved on the backs and in the hands of  nurses.”","['health', 'treatment', 'support', 'aids', 'hiv', 'response', 'nurses', 'epidemic', 'nursing', 'care']","Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, nurses have been at the forefront of the response to this once fatal infection.

Tackle Hepatitis C to Save People Living with HIV,"Opinion: The WHO recognizes that the ‘silent  epidemic’ of viral hepatitis affects a large part of the world’s population  causing over 1.4 million deaths every year, yet remains ...",Shobha Shukla,"June 28, 2014","The WHO recognizes that the ‘silent  epidemic’ of viral hepatitis affects a large part of the world’s population  causing over 1.4 million deaths every year, yet remains largely unknown or ignored.  It is estimated that 240 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis  B virus (HBV) and more than 185 million people are infected with the hepatitis  C virus (HCV). These numbers far exceed the number of people living with HIV  (PLHIV) estimated at 34 million.Viral hepatitis co-infection in  PLHIV is now recognized as a major public health problem resulting in increased  morbidity and mortality among PLHIV including those on antiretroviral therapy  (ART). Chronic HBV infection affects 10% of PLHIV worldwide. Chronic HCV  infection affects 20% of PLHIV, with a majority of them living in low- and  middle-income countries. In countries where injecting drug use is the biggest  risk factor for HIV transmission, as many as 7 out of 10 PLHIV are co infected  with HCV. In countries where sexual behavior is the biggest risk factor for HIV  transmission, HCV co infection is less common, but still a concern, with about  1 in 10 PLHIV being co infected with HCV.HCV is a blood borne virus, most  commonly transmitted through contact with the blood of an HCV-infected person,  through sharing contaminated needles/drug use equipment and blood transfusion.  Less commonly, it is transmitted through sexual contact with an HCV-infected  person, or through birth to an HCV-infected mother. HCV is a much smaller virus  than HIV, so there is a lot of it even in a tiny amount of blood, but unlike  HIV, HCV can stay alive on surfaces outside the body for many days. HCV is 10  times more infectious than HIV.Experts agree that co infection with  HCV makes HIV treatment more complicated. A liver damaged from HCV may cause  HIV medications to become less effective and more toxic. HCV co infection  triples the risk for liver toxicity from HIV medicines. Also, HIV- HCV co  infection more than triples the risk for liver disease and liver-related death  from HCV.HCV has 6 different variants -  genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with further subdivisions in each genotype. This  variability has made it difficult to develop a vaccine that will protect against  all HCV strains. However, unlike HIV infection, Hepatitis C can be cured by  treatment. WHO recommends pegylated and standard interferon (PEG-IFN) in  combination with ribavirin (RBV) to be used for the treatment of chronic HCV  infection.Persons infected with genotypes 1  and 4 are treated with PEG-IFN/RBV for 48â72 weeks, while those infected with  genotypes 2 and 3 are treated with PEG-IFN/RBV for 24â48 weeks. The longer  treatment durations are recommended for persons co infected with HIV and those  with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Persons with genotype 1 infection and an  extended rapid virological response are treated with a shortened course of 24  weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV.Dr Franco Buonaguro, Director, Unit  of Molecular Biology and Viral Oncology, Napoli, Italy, told Citizen News  Service (CNS) that, “The treatment response of HCV for pegylated interferon and  ribavirin is 46% in patients with Genotype 1 and 76% in patients with genotypes  2 and 3, which in case of PLHIV co-infected with HCV reduces drastically to 20%  for genotype 1 and 62 % for type 2 and 3.”Thus not only duration of treatment  for HCV in PLHIV is longer, but treatment response is also poorer. Coupled with  this is the high cost of treatment (US$ 2 000 in Egypt for 48-weeks of PEG/IFN  RBV), and the high rate of adverse events which require regular monitoring,  which prevents most patients from receiving treatment in most low- and  middle-income countries.The field of HCV therapeutics is  however evolving rapidly. New oral drugs sofosbuvir (a specific HCV polymerase  inhibitor approved by the FDA in December 2013 ) and simeprevir, known as  direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have the potential to revolutionize treatment,  with expected cure rates higher than 90% for some genotypes of the disease. The  new guidelines of WHO strongly recommend treatment using sofosbuvir and RBV for  genotypes 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the disease,  with or without PEG-IFN, depending  on the genotype.Dr Buonaguro said that, “Sofosbuvir  treatment regimens and duration are dependent on both viral genotype and  patient population. Patients with genotype 1 or 4 are treated with sofosbuvir  plus PEG-IFN and RBV for 12 weeks; those with genotype 2 or 3 are part of an  all oral drug regimen of sofosbuvir plus RBV for 12 or 24 weeks respectively.  The PHOTON-1 study evaluated sofosbuvir and RBV for 12 weeks in patients with  genotype 2 HCV infection co-infected with HIV-1 and for 24 weeks in patients  with genotypes 1 or 3 HCV co-infected with HIV-1. Trial participants achieved  treatment cure rates of 76-92%.”But the only deterrent is the  prohibitively high price of the DAAs with a 12 weeks Sofosbuvir treatment  costing US $84,000 in the US. At these prices, access in low and middle-income  countries is likely to be extremely limited. Moreover the new medicines have  yet to be licensed in most countries.Generic production of drugs for HCV  can reduce the cost drastically, as had happened in the case of anti  retrovirals for HIV. A study done at Liverpool University shows that a 12-week  course of sofosbuvir could cost as low as $68-$136. But a word of caution here  from Dr Gourdas Choudhuri, Director and Head of Department of Gastroenterology  and Hepatobiliary Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, India: “While generics are  well established for chemical compounds, where efficacy can be tested, HCV  drugs have to be tested in terms of bio efficacy too, and not just by way of  chemical structures. So there will need to be a little more reassurance from  companies launching generic interferons about their effectiveness.”Nonetheless all PLHIV should be  tested for HCV. A new global resolution endorsed by all 194 member states at  the 67th session of WHA in May 2014, has called for enhanced action to improve  equitable access to viral hepatitis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and  requested the WHO Secretariat to facilitate access to affordable treatment.During a CNS press conference at the  19th International AIDS Conference in 2012, Eldred Tellis, Director of the  Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, Mumbai, India, had rightly said that, ""It  makes public health sense to link HCV prevention efforts to HIV programmes.  Prevention and harm reduction efforts for HIV and HCV with vulnerable  communities should go hand in hand. Unless this is done, HCV infections will  rise even though HIV transmission rates reduce, particularly among injecting  drug users â the most vulnerable community.""The HIV Programme is committed to  increase its focus on viral hepatitis and HIV co-infection in 2014â2015. Let us  hope that the forthcoming XX International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2014) in  Melbourne will provide renewed impetuous to making timely viral hepatitis  diagnosis and treatment affordable and accessible to all those in need of it.","['infection', 'treatment', 'c', 'plhiv', 'hepatitis', 'save', 'hiv', 'living', 'weeks', 'genotype', 'hcv', 'tackle', 'infected', 'sofosbuvir']","These numbers far exceed the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) estimated at 34 million.

"Ending AIDS, the Dutch way","Opinion: We are all very  familiar with the phrase ‘going Dutch’ (meaning each person of a group pays  one’s own expenses in an outing), but are we also aware of dealing ...",Shobha Shukla,"July 25, 2018","We are all very  familiar with the phrase ‘going Dutch’ (meaning each person of a group pays  one’s own expenses in an outing), but are we also aware of dealing with  HIV/AIDS the Dutch way? Perhaps very few of us know that “Amsterdam, which is  currently hosting the 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) from  23-27th July 2018 - the largest conference for any global health issue in the  world - became the first city in the world to overshoot the 90:90:90 target,  set by UNAIDS (joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS), with a continuum  progress of 94:90:94,” said Alphonsus Stoelinga, Netherlands Ambassador to  India, in an exclusive interview given to CNS (Citizen News Service) on the eve  of AIDS 2018.  Stoelinga shared with  pride (and rightly so) that Netherlands has indeed been on the forefront of the  global fight against HIV/AIDS for quite some time now. “We are actively  contributing to UNAIDS’ 90:90:90 target for 2020 that is also intertwined with  the global promise of ending AIDS through the adoption of SDGs by 2030. As per  UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS)’ Country Progress Report 2016, the  Netherlands’ estimated continuum progress in as far back as December 2014 was  88:94:92, with 88% HIV-infected people diagnosed and linked to care; 94% with  initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 92% of all people  receiving ART with suppressed viral load”, said the Ambassador.  Multi-sectoral  approaches and innovations are a must  Any efforts directed  towards ending AIDS cannot function without multi-level cooperation and  innovation. Presently, in the absence of functional vaccines or cures against  HIV infection, the need for countries to join hands and innovate - both at the  local and global levels - becomes more important than ever. “I am very proud to  share that the Kingdom of the Netherlands has consistently and diligently been  working at both these levels. The Dutch HIV/AIDS policy focuses on 3 core  principles: (i) Prevention (ii) Linkage between prevention and care and (iii)  Ensuring low threshold access to testing and treatment”, informed Stoelinga.  Dealing with HIV the  Dutch way  Netherlands  Ambassador to India Stoelinga claimed that the Dutch were the first nation in  the world to spearhead large scale needle exchange programmes to combat the  spread of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs). “The first information  campaign targeting the Dutch population began in 1987 and it was initiated by  the government. HIV testing through public health institutions is  free-of-charge. Outreach programs are perpetually being set up for specific  risk populations being tested. Free HIV testing, on World AIDS Day (December 1)  and during the AIDS Conference 2018, are also being offered. All pregnant women  in the Netherlands are tested free of cost for HIV. For most other people, HIV  testing is covered by health insurance. Those who are more likely to have STIs  and/or HIV (the high risk populations) for various reasons can get tested for  free at an STI Outpatients’ Clinic of the Public Health Service”, he said.  The again, in  Netherlands, HIV testing is also available through the internet and the  pharmacy. This allows one to test ones blood or saliva for HIV antibodies at  home. The young population is given particular attention - by way of sexual  education at schools, mother/child care (in the form of food supplements),  prevention of teenage pregnancy, ensuring that young people can be tested for  HIV, and those living with HIV have access to the care they need.  “Our efforts cover  the full spectrum. We have a close-knit system of physicians, nurses, social  workers working together to keep all people living with HIV in a continuum of  care. Additionally, keeping up with the reach and power of social media,  communicating about HIV/AIDS is also a part of our efforts”, the Ambassador  said.  Global collaboration  Netherlands  collaborates and shares technical assistance and knowledge with other countries  at the global level. At the same time, it also learns from partner countries  that have their own set of challenges and solutions. Partnerships are key,  working together across sectors and national boundaries is deeply embedded in  the country’s traditions.   Stoelinga gave one  the example of one such initiative - the HIV-Cohort between India, Netherlands  and Sweden. Launched during Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s visit to India in May  this year, the programme is aimed at tapping into complementary, diverse  research strengths and expertise across the three countries to strengthen the  development of better tools to understand and address the epidemic of HIV/AIDS,  informed Stoelinga.  Sexual and  reproductive health and rights (SRHR) are closely related to the goal of ending  AIDS. For the Dutch government, the diagnosis, treatment and subsequently,  ending AIDS is also closely linked to two of its international policy  priorities - SRHR and women empowerment. “We focus on linking SRHR with  HIV/AIDS to ensure people have the knowledge and the means to prevent HIV.  Linking HIV/AIDS initiatives with SRHR also create an enabling environment in  which individuals are free to take decisions to protect themselves.”  Stoelinga emphasised  that Netherlands government’s priority is to find a functional or real cure for  HIV infection. Various research programmes, such as the one at Erasmus Medical  College, have been set up to reach this goal. While this is still at a research  stage and not clinical practice, he reiterated that the Netherlands will continue  to strive for a functional cure against HIV/AIDS.  Stoelinga firmly  believes that HIV/AIDS issues also form a vital branch for UN’s Sustainable  Development Goal 3 (Good health and well-being) and Goal 5 (Gender equality).  “Netherlands has been consistently performing well under the SDG 3. Our country  is in full compliance with the international health regulations, and for seven  years in a row it has topped the European Health Consumer Index”.","['health', 'testing', 'aids', 'hivaids', 'hiv', 'world', 'netherlands', 'ending', 'global', 'way', 'care', 'dutch']","We are all very familiar with the phrase ‘going Dutch’ (meaning each person of a group pays one’s own expenses in an outing), but are we also aware of dealing with HIV/AIDS the Dutch way?

Now, 15 years later, new HIV infections are down significantly worldwide, while  access to treatment has cut the number of AIDS-related deaths by more than a  third. These achievements are no accident. In 2000, Governments committed to  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which addressed the greatest challenges  of our time, including halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV. The  progress we have seen since then fulfills a promise and proves, that strong  leadership and sustained engagement deliver results.Still, much more remains to be done. This year, the  international community will need to, once more, show bold action in charting a  path forward on HIV. In September, as the deadline for achieving the MDGs comes  to an end, governments will decide on a new set of sustainable development  goals for the period after 2015. Â To help  define the future of the HIV response in this new era, Governments across  Asia-Pacific together with civil society and other partners are gathering in  Bangkok this week at a major regional meeting convened by the United Nations  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), in partnership  with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and other organizations.Since HIV first emerged, the Asia-Pacific region  has been a leader in demonstrating political commitment and investing resources  to address the epidemic. Initiatives like Thailandâs programme to promote safer  sex have been widely replicated. However, if the region is to continue to be a  pioneer, Governments must urgently confront several challenges head-on.Perhaps the biggest challenge is ensuring  sustainable financing for HIV programmes. More than US$ 2 billion has been  mobilized for Asia and the Pacific, but international donors account for nearly  40 per cent of the funding. This is not sustainable. While external donors have  played a critical role in providing seed money for HIV programmes, countries  cannot forever rely on international funding.Clearly there is scope for greater domestic  spending given the regionâs economic dynamism. China is an example of what is  possible. Between 2006 and 2013 the country increased spending on HIV  programming seven times. Now, due to its committed leadership, China has made  the transition to full self-reliance, even in the face of one of the most  serious AIDS epidemics in the region. While some low-income countries will  continue to need support from international donors, Governments must share  responsibility and invest significantly. Otherwise, they risk losing the gains  they have worked so hard to secure. They must pay now, or pay forever.While larger domestic investments are needed, it is  equally important to get more value for money. As ESCAP member states have  recognized in past resolutions, the populations most affected by the HIV  epidemic include sex workers, men who have  sex with men, transgender people, and people who inject drugs.Yet, despite this knowledge, many countries are  underfunding precisely those programmes which would make the most impact. Only  an estimated 8 per cent of overall AIDS spending is for HIV prevention among key  populations at higher risk of HIV exposure. To get results, health authorities  must work with civil society to promote community-based HIV services for the people  who need them most. Two-thirds of key populations donât know their HIV status.  It is important to scale up HIV testing by offering simple but highly effective  tests in communities.However, ensuring a full return on investments doesnât  only depend on funding. Stigma and discrimination prevent people living with  HIV and key population groups from accessing essential services. Almost every country in the region has laws, policies or  practices that hinder the AIDS response. For example, 42 countries criminalize  some aspect of sex work and 21 countries prohibit same-sex sexual relations.  Such laws and policies are unjust, prevent social development and increase  risky health behaviour. They must be reversed.1.5 million people living with HIV in Asia-Pacific  are accessing life-saving treatment. While this is a big success, it poses a  challenge for the sustainable funding of the AIDS response. To compound the  problem, millions more people still need to receive treatment. Governments will,  therefore, need to meet the demand for more treatment in the coming years,  including new and more expensive antiretroviral treatments (ARTs).The Asia-Pacific region has the potential to meet  this challenge. It is a hub of entrepreneurial and scientific innovation, which  manufactures affordable HIV treatment and other commodities on a large scale. Indian  manufacturers, for example, already provide the bulk of the generic ARTs used  in low-and-middle income countries, helping to drive down the cost of HIV  treatment across the globe. Going forward, we will need to continue this trend towards  reducing the price of ARTs, discovering new and more powerful treatments, and  hopefully one day finding a cure.Ending the AIDS epidemic in Asia and the Pacific is  possible, as long as countries have the courage and wisdom to take the right  kinds of action. Governments must invest significantly more in the AIDS  response. They must increase the impact of their investments by refocusing  their efforts on the people at higher risk of HIV infection. Finally, they must  promote scientific innovation and affordable access to life-saving medicine. Such  bold actions will not only accelerate the progress made in Asia and the Pacific  in responding to HIV in the new millennium; they will also help propel the  world to end the AIDS epidemic, once and for all.","['asiapacific', 'governments', 'lead', 'treatment', 'aids', 'countries', 'sustainable', 'hiv', 'need', 'end', 'region', 'sex', 'epidemic', 'world']","This century opened with the AIDS epidemic at its peak.

"10,500 People Die from Tuberculosis Every Year in Afghanistan","News: KABUL - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 53,000 people contract tuberculosis (TB) every year in Afghanistan. The available figures indicate that 66 percent of  ...",Daily Outlook Afghanistan,"December 04, 2012","KABUL - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 53,000 people contract tuberculosis (TB) every year in Afghanistan. The available figures indicate that 66 percent of new cases are women and 10 percent are children.  WHO has said that more than 670 children younger than 15 were diagnosed with TB last year in Afghanistan and, of those, the majority of the cases, 465, were girls.  The Afghan Ministry of Public Health has reported that nearly 10,500 people die from TB each year in the country and nearly 650 children succumbed to the disease last year.  Experts believe that poor working and living conditions, poverty, traditional beliefs, lack of awareness about the disease, security, lack of access to proper medications and health facilities for an earlier diagnosis of the disease and intervention are among the reasons for the high incidence of tuberculosis.  The internationally-recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS), which is believed to be the most efficient and cost-effective tuberculosis control strategy, has been used in Afghanistan with some success.  The implementation of DOTS requires sustained political and financial commitment to ensure that there can be: diagnosis by quality ensured sputum-smear microscopy; standardized short-course anti-TB treatment (SSC) given under direct and supportive observation (DOT); a regular, uninterrupted supply of high quality anti-TB drugs; and a standardized recording and reporting mechanism.  According to available figures, the percentage of people with access to DOTS in Afghanistan has increased from 14 to 97 percent since 2002 and the number of health facilities which apply DOTS has increased from 10 in 2000 to nearly 1,200 in 2011.  Based on the DOTS successes, the WHO developed a six-point âStop TB Strategyâ to address the key challenges faced by TB worldwide. The main purpose of the strategy is to lessen the global TB burden by 2015 and ensure that all TB patients and those co-infected with HIV and drug-resistant TB take advantage of universal access to high-quality diagnosis and patient-centered treatment.  The six-point âStop TB Strategyâ includes sustaining, improving and accelerating quality DOTS expansion; addressing TB-HIV, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and other special challenges; contributing to health system strengthening; engaging all care providers; empowering patients and communities; and enabling and promoting research.  Keeping in mind the current threat posed by TB in Afghanistan, experts suggest that more priority should be given to a carefully-designed national TB communication strategy based on the six-point âStop TB Strategyâ in Afghanistan. The communication objective should be clear whether it wants to raise awareness about the danger of TB; promote TB safe behavior among those who are aware of the dangers of TB or promote TB safe behavior among a group of people who are at particular risk.  The comprehensive communication strategy needs to be based on the results of well designed research, using Knowledge, Attitude, Practices and Beliefs (KAPB), Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) research methods.  Specials attention should be given to rural areas where the majority of the population live and where the level of understanding of TB is very low. An overall majority of people in Afghanistan do not know the early signs and symptoms of TB and think that it is an incurable disease.  Meanwhile, any research to be conducted in the country will need to pay special attention to women and girls who make up the majority of the TB cases in Afghanistan and are traditionally responsible, in certain parts of the country, for working in some unhygienic environments such as stables, pens, backyards, and collecting and bringing home firewood, bushes and animal droppings. They are also responsible for cooking, washing and taking care of other household chores and all these could make them more prone to the disease.  Despite TB eradication efforts, Afghanistan has remained one of the 22 TB high-burden countries in the world. The alarming figures indicate that Afghanistan has a long way to go before getting rid of this preventable disease.

Governments Must Stand Up for Health,"Opinion: It was just a century  ago that the Spanish flu epidemic spread across the world and killed tens of  millions of people. Long before the moon landing, the Internet ...",Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,"September 22, 2018","It was just a century  ago that the Spanish flu epidemic spread across the world and killed tens of  millions of people. Long before the moon landing, the Internet, or the  discovery of the Higgs boson, the world was at the mercy of a disease that  struck indiscriminately and did not respect national boundaries. The epidemic  required an absolutely extraordinary response.  A hundred years on,  contagious diseases continue to cross borders faster and more efficiently than  people or goods. But other epidemics, of chronic and noncommunicable diseases  (NCDs), are also a scourge to communities around the world. In fact, in terms  of the scale of human suffering and the costs for society, these diseases can  be even more devastating than their contagious counterparts.  At the United Nations  General Assembly in New York, global heads of state are meeting on September  26-27 to highlight two major health threats. On the first day, they will  discuss strategies to end tuberculosis (TB), an ancient bacterium that remains  the world’s deadliest infectious disease. TB claims more than 4,000 lives per  day, and is among the top ten causes of death globally. To make a bad situation  worse, it is also a major cause of deaths linked to antimicrobial resistance,  as well as the leading killer of people with HIV.  Then, on the second  day, world leaders will convene to discuss plans to beat leading NCDs such as  cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and lung disease. Combined, NCDs are  responsible for seven out of every ten deaths globally. All told, NCDs kill 41  million people every year, including 15 million people in the prime of their  lives, aged 30-70. In addition to confronting TB and NCDs, world leaders will  also discuss ways to promote mental health and wellbeing.  Developing countries  bear the brunt of the TB and NCD epidemics, as most of the people suffering and  dying prematurely from these diseases are in low- and middle-income countries.  But while TB and NCDs are very different types of health threats, the best  response to them is the same: We must build stronger health systems that are  capable of delivering universal health coverage (UHC).  UHC makes health care  accessible to everyone, no matter their circumstances. It delivers the full  range of essential services, from prevention and treatment to palliative and  rehabilitative to all people, not just those who can afford it.  The principles  underlying UHC apply equally to protecting people against TB, NCDs, and  promoting mental health. But while the urgent need for UHC is widely  understood, real change will not happen without a greater commitment from the  highest levels of government.  This means that  presidents and prime ministers must become the champions of their people’s  health. Only by ensuring a government-wide response can UHC be achieved, given  that what drives good and bad health so often lies outside the remit of health  ministries.   By highlighting the  challenges posed by TB and NCDs, the UN is giving political leaders a unique  chance to put the wellbeing of their citizens first. They should remember that  promoting health pays dividends on many other fronts, too, from economic  development to security.  So far, governments  have already committed to achieving key global targets for TB and NCDs. With  respect to TB, the world still needs to treat the 40 million people living with  the disease, and provide preventive care to another 30 million, all by 2022.  And to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we must end the  epidemic by 2030. Countries can meet these targets by making investments geared  specifically toward scaling up prevention, detection, treatment, and research.  As for NCDs, the SDGs  commit governments to reduce premature deaths from these diseases by one-third.  Progress toward this goal has not been fast enough to ensure that it is met  before 2030.  Fortunately, there  are low-cost ways for governments to meet these targets and save lives.  Regulatory measures can protect people from exposure to the common causes of  NCDs: tobacco, alcohol, physical inactivity, and foods and drinks high in  trans-fats, salt, and sugar. Investments in health systems can improve disease  detection and treatment for conditions like hypertension and diabetes.  Vaccinating girls against the human papillomavirus (HPV), and screening women  on a routine basis, can drastically reduce deaths from cervical cancer.  At meetings in Russia  and Uruguay last year, health ministers from around the world committed to  accelerating action against TB and NCDs. Now it is time to take the next step.  The UN General  Assembly is a unique opportunity for world leaders to foster a true global good  â better health for their citizens â by advancing universal coverage to end TB,  beat NCDs, and promote better mental health.","['leaders', 'governments', 'health', 'ncds', 'deaths', 'tb', 'stand', 'disease', 'uhc', 'million', 'world', 'diseases']","In addition to confronting TB and NCDs, world leaders will also discuss ways to promote mental health and wellbeing.

Winning the War on Tuberculosis,"Opinion: The world is finally  waking up to the threat posed by one of the most overlooked diseases of our  time. Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted ...",Ibrahim Assane Mayaki,"October 14, 2018","The world is finally  waking up to the threat posed by one of the most overlooked diseases of our  time. Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted the  first-ever high-level meeting on tuberculosis (TB) to explore options for  international eradication efforts. But, as welcome as this new global focus is,  the fact remains that the road to beating TB begins in Africa.  Simply put, TB  remains one of the deadliest epidemics in Africa today, and one-quarter of all  TB deaths worldwide occur there. In 2016, some 417,000 people on the continent  succumbed to the disease. Recent outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB and  extensively drug-resistant TB in South Africa, Mozambique, and Ghana could push  the annual death toll even higher. These pockets of the bacterium, now  completely immune to antimicrobial treatment, mean that the challenge of global  eradication has become even more daunting.  Part of the reason  for TB’s persistence is the vulnerability of the populations it infects. For  starters, TB is among the leading killers of HIV-positive people, claiming some  40% of those who die from HIV. This poses dangers for non-HIV patients as well,  especially those with suppressed immune systems, young children, and infants.  Eradication is also  difficult because TB is a highly contagious airborne bacterium; people living  and working in close quarters â such as miners, prisoners, migrants, and  refugees â suffer the highest rates of infection. Finally, because TB  prevalence is closely linked to poverty and social marginalization, reaching  those most at risk is not always easy.  Infectious diseases  have no borders, and as African countries deepen their trade ties and  intra-Africa migration grows, the threat of regional pandemics will only  increase. This makes it all the more critical that Africa begin developing a  multi-sector, integrated approach to containing, controlling, and eventually  eradicating public-health challenges like TB.  To this end, one  approach that African governments could emulate is the TB management strategy  in place for the continent’s mining sector, an inter-agency plan devised in  2014 by the Southern African Development Community. Although this so-called  “harmonized” approach applies to a commercial industry, its focus on  coordinating with the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) â African Union  states grouped for economic integration â could serve as a model for more  effective collective action on TB containment.  But before a specific  framework can be agreed upon, three issues require urgent attention. First,  African health-care planners and disease specialists must set country,  regional, and local containment targets. For example, setting goals for  reductions in new TB infections would enable health officials to measure more  accurately the impact of their strategies.  Moreover, to end TB  completely, Africa will need new and sustained financial commitments from the  public and private sectors. And, finally, disease-control strategies must be  designed to support the economic and health-care priorities of the RECs. At the  moment, most state and regional health-care systems lack funding and human  resources. African policymakers must therefore develop systems for prevention,  diagnosis, and care that help governments share the disease burden and ensure  that treatment protocols are consistent across regions.  To be sure, there are  some positive trends in the fight against TB. Global infection rates are  falling by about 2% annually, and even African countries hit by TB still  managed a 4% decline in infections from 2013 to 2017. And, with organizations  like the World Health Organization and the African Union beginning to produce  roadmaps for TB eradication, it is clear that momentum is steadily building.  Still, sustaining  this progress in Africa will require significant regional coordination, not to  mention a lot more money. Most vaccines and medications are currently too  expensive for the majority of Africans. But even those lucky enough to obtain  treatment â usually a six- to eight-month course of powerful antibiotics â  still face a 20% chance of relapse.  The goal of  eradicating TB is within reach; the recent gathering at the UNGA marked a  critical turning point in the world’s war on the disease. But even as  commitments are made and declarations signed, we must remember that in Africa,  the battle is far from over.","['tuberculosis', 'treatment', 'african', 'war', 'tb', 'disease', 'healthcare', 'finally', 'systems', 'global', 'regional', 'winning', 'africa']","Last month, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) hosted the first-ever high-level meeting on tuberculosis (TB) to explore options for international eradication efforts.

More than 70,000 drug addicts are only in Heart. Being a bordering province with Iran, Heart has large number of drug addicts because most of them are the Afghan refugee returnees.   Afghanistan produces about 90 percent of the world poppy production. The number of drug addicts in the country is based on estimations and not clear. Though overall statistics is not as terrible as from Herat, however it reflects the severity of the situation.   The Government has no efficient program for drug addicts. For instance, there is only one hospital of 150-bed for over 70,000 drug addicts in Herat. This shows how ignorant the Government has been to this issue. There must have been strict checking and rehabilitation centers in Herat for all the returnees. The one very severe negative impact of Afghan refuge in Iran has been the mounting number of drug addicts across the country, beside the spread of HIV AIDS and prostitution. The concerned quarters of the Government ministries should have serious attention towards this plague. With only one hospital for such a big number of drug addicts, the situation is getting more serious and deadly.   These drug addicts spread across the country. With easy availability of all kinds of drugs in cheap prices, they not only continue with this life-ending addiction, but also spread use of drugs among their circle of influence, friends and contacts. In the political scene, there has been only rhetoric, the war on opium, but the fight against drug addiction has been totally ignored. And the number of addicts increases every year with higher percentages. The Government should pay attention to this and put more resources. But indeed the Government alone has not the capacity and resources to fight against the drug addiction. International anti-drug and aid organizations should focus this issue in their programs, particularly in the Afghan provinces bordering with Iran. Media has to highlight this severe issue, not only in news coverage to show where and how severe the situation is, but also it should help increase public awareness about it.","['addicts', 'drug', 'afghan', 'number', 'issue', 'iran', 'spread', 'increasing', 'herat', 'severe', 'country']","The number of drug addicts is increasing without a check or any effective program by the government to stop it.

Addicts going through treatment  and rehabilitation will join a nine-month vocational training course  ...,Ali Bahrami,"February 28, 2013","A World Bank-funded project for rehabilitation of drug  addicts is being launched in Kabul and Paktia. Addicts going through treatment  and rehabilitation will join a nine-month vocational training course aimed at  improving their livelihood. They would learn carpet-weaving, tailoring,  embroidery, repair works of mobile phones, bicycles, motorbikes etc. It will  help the unemployment and lack of skill among the increasing number of drug  addicts a large number of whom live in capital Kabul. The Government needs to increase focus and international  donorsâ support projects for rehabilitation of drug addicts across the country.  There has been less attention on this rampant deadly issue. The increasing number of drug addicts in Kabul is causing  serious social problems. According to official statistics, the number of drug  addicts in Afghanistan has reached over one million, of which about 60,000 are  women. The  Government has no efficient rehabilitation program. There is not a single hospital  for drug addicts in capital Kabul. Afghan refugees returning from Iran makes  the largest number of addicts. It is just one of the problems that come  with Afghan refugees, besides the spread of HIV  AIDS, prostitution  and other social problems. With easy  availability of all kinds of drugs at cheap prices, it is spreading fast  in other parts of the country. Life Is Beautiful is one of the few organizations working  particularly on rehabilitation of drug addicts in Kabul. With a group of  volunteers, their work has been extraordinary, despite lack of resources and  donor support. The US and its NATO allies caught up in an exit strategy, are  largely ignoring the focus on poppy eradication, and our government with some  bigwigs of the power corridor involved in drug profits have always been  opposing effective and harsh programs of eradication. The government and international forces should enforce the poppy  eradication campaign. The war on poppy is forgotten. The drug industry export  deaths to millions of people around the world, and the number of drug addicts is  on a rampant increase in Afghanistan. If the current policy of bribing the poppy-growing farmers  continues, which benefits the drug mafia and opium business tycoons who make  the real deal from all this, it will keep Afghanistan the biggest producer of  drugs in the world for the second consecutive decade. Meanwhile, the government should pay greater attention towards  rehabilitation of drug addicts and its spread. They must launch effective  programs. There are very few special hospitals for them across the country. The  number of women drug addictsâ60,000âis something that should deeply worry us  all.","['rehabilitation', 'addicts', 'drug', 'number', 'problems', 'spread', 'social', 'kabul', 'poppy', 'world']","A World Bank-funded project for rehabilitation of drug addicts is being launched in Kabul and Paktia.

The official recorded number has increased one million, of which about 60,000 are women! And even more shocking, over 70,000 of these addicts are from Herat province alone.   If the main reason for this huge number could be the fact that Herat borders Iran and Afghan refugees who return bring the evil with them, then the question is, refugee returnees repatriate to all parts of Afghanistan, why such huge concentration only in Herat? Official reports do not explain this.   However, what we know is that the Government has no efficient program for drug addicts in the province, or any part of the country for that matter. There is only one hospital of 150-bed for over 70,000 drug addicts in Herat. There must be strict checking and rehabilitation centers in Herat for all the returnees. The mounting number of drug addicts across the country is just one of the problems that come with Afghan refugees, besides the spread of HIV AIDS, prostitution and social problems. With easy availability of all kinds of drugs in cheap prices, it is spreading fast in other parts of the country.   The above shocking statistics are just from Herat. The overall picture is much bleaker. Our economy depends heavily on drug trade. While talking at an international conference recently, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged countries involved in Afghanistan to step up the fight to combat poppy cultivation and drug business. He said there cannot be sustainable development when opium production is the only viable economic activity in Afghanistan, and added that there cannot be stability when 15 percent of our gross domestic product comes from drug trade.   The UN Secretary General said Afghanistan's drug economy is worth $2.4 billion. He emphasized that the Afghan Government must prioritize the issue of narcotics. Law enforcement agencies must work harder on eradication crops, eliminating laboratories, keeping precursors from entering the country.   According to a UN report released last year, poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has increased significantly. The report said there has been an increase of seven percent in the year 2011 compared to the year before that. The increase was reported despite the fact that Ministry of Antinarcotics had claimed to have destroyed 65 percent of the total cultivation that year.   The US and its NATO allies caught up in the prioritize of an exit strategy, are largely ignoring the focus on poppy eradication, and our Government with some bigwigs of the power corridor involved in drug profits have always been opposing effective and harsh programs of eradication.   Our neighboring countries including Russia have been calling for active anti-narcotics action in Afghanistan.   The Government and international forces should enforce the poppy eradication campaign. The war on poppy is forgotten. Aside from the fact that a huge part of the financial support to insurgents comes from transport and smuggling of opium, it's also exporting deaths to millions of people around the world, and the number of drug addicts increasing in Afghanistan. Taliban militants get $400 million a year through direct and indirect revenue from poppy cultivation, transportation and trade.  The Counter-Narcotics law is yet to go in effect. It was approved in 2009, but under the pretext of the so-called alternative programs, the Government has not implemented the law. Once this law goes into effect, there will be legal action against farmers who cultivate poppy crop. The punishment is not strict, but this law must be implemented and practiced strongly.   The law includes 5 chapters and 67 Articles. It was approved in 2009, but due to the poppy eradication campaigns, its implementation has been postponed.   Once this law goes into effect, there will be legal action against farmers who cultivate poppy crop. The punishment is not strict, but this law must be implemented and practiced strongly to make it effective. According to latest reports, there has been an increase of seven percent in the year 2011 compared to the previous year.   If the current policy of bribing the poppy-growing farmers continues, which benefits the drug mafia and opium business tycoons who make the real deal from all this, it will keep Afghanistan the biggest producer of drugs in the world for the second consecutive decade.   The Government and international community should step up efforts against poppy eradication.   Meanwhile, the government should pay greater attention toward rehabilitation of drug addicts and its spread. They must launch effective programs. Three is no strategy and programs for bringing back the drug addicts to normal life. There are very few special hospitals for them across the country. The number of women drug addictsâ60,000âis something that should deeply worry us all. The international community has other priorities, but this issue needs much greater attention.","['addicts', 'drug', 'shocking', 'statistics', 'number', 'programs', 'law', 'afghanistan', 'herat', 'eradication', 'international', 'poppy']","A new report on drug addicts in Afghanistan has shocking statistics.

Viktor Ivanov, director of Russia's Federal Service for the Control of Narcotics, in Chicago for meetings with his American counterparts, said he agreed with the dim assessment of U.S. poppy eradication efforts by some members of the U.S. Congress. ""Their words were that the efforts are unsatisfactory,"" Ivanov said through an interpreter in an interview with Reuters. He referred to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein and Republican Senator Charles Grassley, who co-chair a caucus on international drug trafficking. Russia has said the United States made a mistake in 2009 by phasing out crop eradication efforts to focus instead on intercepting drugs and hunting production labs and drug lords.  President Barack Obama has committed to turning over security to Afghan control by the end of 2014. The United States launched the war weeks after the September 11, 2001, attacks, targeting al Qaeda and the Taliban. Joint Russian-American anti-drug operations have appeared to tail off since a raid in October 2010 seized a ton of heroin and destroyed four drug-producing laboratories.  There were four more joint raids conducted between December 2010 and February 2011, but Ivanov said it was cumbersome to obtain military approval quickly, given time-sensitive intelligence. IDEOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL  In spite of concerns that the Taliban and other insurgent elements were financed by illegal drug profits, Ivanov said absentee landowners and traffickers who reap the bulk of the $7 billion in illegal drug proceeds did not have an ideological stake in the decade-old war. The Taliban earned $150 million annually from drug trafficking, he said. But the traffickers have hijacked the military's transportation infrastructure in Afghanistan to help them ship their product, he said. The rising number of violent clashes in Afghanistan worked against any effort to persuade farmers to grow legal crops instead of opium poppies, Ivanov said. ""Ask any farmer if he's growing wheat and at the same time his country is torn by all sorts of military clashes. How safe will he feel about the future of his crops and the eventual sale of his crops?"" Ivanov said.  ""That's why we think the most efficient and effective measure is to destroy the product, the drug plantations and the drug laboratories,"" he said. The United Nations said land devoted to opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan rose 7 percent this year to 1,310 square kilometers (506 sq miles), much of it in the less-secure south and east.  ""This tremendous amount of heroin is produced on a relatively small territory ... about the area of New York City,"" Ivanov said. He lobbied for creation of a digital poppy map that would identify poppy plantations and show where eradication was working, or not. The publicly accessible map would use surveillance data gathered by American drones and possibly a Russian-American satellite dedicated to the task.  Ivanov said Russia, which fought its own costly war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, had also embarked on a concerted effort to treat its own addicts, which critics say it has often failed to do up to now.  Scientists were working on a new pharmaceutical approach that would suppress the urge to use while not substituting one drug for another. Russian officials have rejected methadone, saying it is merely exchanges one addiction for another.  U.S. addiction rates were also on the rise, Ivanov warned, with many users smoking or inhaling purer Afghan heroin. (Reuters)","['drug', 'opium', 'afghan', 'war', 'afghanistan', 'heroin', 'efforts', 'united', 'thrives', 'russia', 'crops', 'ivanov', 'poppy', 'traffic']","CHICAGO - U.S. efforts to eradicate Afghanistan's opium poppy crops, which cover an area about the size of New York City, have been ""unsatisfactory,"" Russia's anti-drug czar said Thursday.
Russia is the world's largest per capita consumer of heroin and is coping with an epidemic of HIV/AIDS spread by dirty needles.

Women Rights Violations,"Opinion: The Sunday’s suicide bombing in central Kabul led to the  injury of a female member of parliament, Shokria Barikzai, and at least 21  civilians and killed three others, including a  ...",Hujjatullah Zia,"November 19, 2014","The Sunday’s suicide bombing in central Kabul led to the  injury of a female member of parliament, Shokria Barikzai, and at least 21  civilians and killed three others, including a 21-year-old university student  Qudsia. Her body was left on the road with the burnt pages of Holy Qur’an  around her â showing that she intended to protect the Sacred Book from the  explosion. Qudsia’s death came as a complete shock to her family and friends.  Her old mother was mourning painfully over Qudsia’s funeral. Since terrorists victimize all Afghan citizens irrespective  of their gender, it cannot be called violence against women. However, to  scrutinize the incident deeply, women are more vulnerable than men in our  society. On Sunday’s incident, a female MP was the main target. Recently, girls  and women suffer more than ever before. As a result, two females, aged 12 and 3  fell prey to gang rape in Takhar province just days ago â which aroused  people’s concern. Domestic violence, terror, rape and abuse of women remain  disgraceful blots on the reputation of our country. The suffering of children  invariably impacts more greatly on women than on men. Too many women continue  to bear the brunt of social and economic deprivation, in the rural as well as  urban areas. Nelson Mandela believes that as long as we take the view  that these are problems for women alone to solve, we cannot expect to reverse  the high incidence of rape and child abuse. Domestic violence will not be  eradicated. We will not defeat this scourge that affects each and every one of  us, until we succeed in mobilizing the whole of our society to fight it. He  raises his concern regarding women’s sufferings and says, “For every woman and  girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into  unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every  woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For  every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our women. For every woman  infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.”On Wednesday, UN reporter on violence against women, Rashida  Manjoo, has called on the Government of Afghanistan and the international  community to adopt sustainable measures to address the causes and consequences  of gender-based violence in the country.Ms. Manjoo warned in a statement that violence against women  in Afghanistan continues to be a source of deep concern, despite positive  legislative and institutional developments brought forward amid a situation of  insecurity throughout the country.“Accountability for all crimes committed against women and  girls, the empowerment of women, and the transformation of society, need to  remain a focus for the Government of Afghanistan, independent State  institutions, civil society organizations and also the international  community,” the expert stressed.When reporting crimes committed against them, Ms. Manjoo  said that many women and girls do not register complaints due to their lack of  knowledge of the law and its protective remedial provisions; fear of reprisal  from the perpetrators and family members; financial and other constraints,  including the lack of freedom of movement; and fear of being treated as  criminals instead of victims.Child marriage still looms large in our society. One of the  reasons which prompts many families to force their young daughters into  marriage is the lack of security stemming from three decades of war, including  the risk of kidnapping and rape. Some girls are bartered into marriage to repay  debt or resolve a dispute. And widespread poverty still compels many parents to  have their daughters married to avoid the cost of caring for them.The implications of child marriage cannot be overestimated  as many girls do not continue their education and remain illiterate. They have  babies while still young teenagers, increasing health problems and risking  death for themselves and their children.The Afghan government and law-enforcement agencies need to  take the discrimination and violence against women seriously. But at the same  time the root causes of the problem have to be addressed. Until and unless  women are considered an integral part of society nothing fundamental will  change.Education is the best strategy to liberate women from male  domination. Only 40% of Afghan girls attend elementary school, and only one in  20 girls attend school beyond the sixth grade. Many Afghan families will only  permit their daughters to attend all-girls schools close to home and few such schools  exist. Other families believe it is unnecessary for girls to be educated.  Schools for girls have been burned down, hundreds of teachers educating girls  have been threatened or killed and girls have been harassed while attending or  walking to or from school.A vicious circle of lack of education, poverty, illiteracy  and violence fuel the highly patriarchal society, even fundamentalism and  militancy, which still characterize Afghanistan today. Breaking the cycle will  take great resolve and courage, as many Afghan women and men have demonstrated  â sometimes paying with their lives. Although progress is slow, hope is found  in places least expected. I would like to conclude with the nice poems of Zieba  Shorish-Shamley which rightly reflects the state of Afghan women, “They made me  invisible, shrouded and non-being. A shadow, no existence, made silent and  unseeing. Denied of freedom, confined to my cage! Tell me how to handle my  anger and my rage?”","['girls', 'society', 'rape', 'afghan', 'violations', 'marriage', 'men', 'woman', 'remain', 'women', 'violence', 'rights']","Since terrorists victimize all Afghan citizens irrespective of their gender, it cannot be called violence against women.

But the evidences clearly show the reverse. Their true wisdom and knowledge are today's main achievements and inventions. The archaeological excavations show that our forefathers were much ...,Abdul Samad Haidari,"May 13, 2012","Are we really living a glorious life with enlightenment?Man is living in twenty first century and has left behind the stone 	and Iron Age lifestyle. Man used every toll for his comfort but none of them could satisfy his dire desire. Today he has reached to the moon, and explores for other planets. The more he earned, the more he lost the conscience and became completely isolated and annihilated from the social life. He did every struggle to fulfill his desire but the more he achieved the worst he lives.   Man served centuries in defining to create a mechanical device ""Computer"" that no one could ever think of. Today man has created computer and most other technological and advanced devices for his comfort, but the question is, ""Are we really rising?"" ""Are we really going ahead of the time?"" The emergence of modern technology has allowed humankind to live luxurious lives. Today, people indulge themselves with modern innovations, which did not exist in ancient world. The current age has coddled men with ecommerce, advanced communication, video conferences, digital libraries and many other advanced technologies. These inventions have prompted men to strive as much as possible. Due to today's modernism, the world is called ""a global village"".  It is worthy to note that at the time of our forefathers, we did not have blood pressure, heart attack or HIV aids. Every disease was simple to cure. In the same way, people were living a simple life with honesty, hospitality, dignity and respect. They used to study under lamps, with quality and quantity. They worked mostly in agricultural field but lived a happier life and connected to each other at any point of time. We think that we have risen into a wonderful life of innovations and surpassed our forefathers in almost every aspects of life! The twenty first century seems to us a glorious age of modernity and we feel proud of ourselves on its achievements and ignore the ancient time's accomplishments.   Modern people think that they are much more civilized than their forefathers and that they were not civilized as of them. But the evidences clearly show the reverse. Their true wisdom and knowledge are today's main achievements and inventions. The archaeological excavations show that our forefathers were much civilized. The great pyramids of Egypt, the arena or the coliseum, palace buildings, etc. of Rome, great market places and the ports of Athens in Greece and many more that I can't take names, are the symbols of ancient civilizations that we can't see them unfortunately or bypass them in some ways. These achievements are the great examples of their civilizations to show how advanced they were in their particular time. Indeed, they were the true hero of their time and as well as ours.   The richness of ancient civilization can be seen from the architectural beauty of Afghanistan's Buddahs in Bamyan, one of the world's most glorious master-pieces that attract all people, from every corner of the world. The Kunduz Hoard of silver coins, the Bagram Treasure, a collection of precious 2nd-century Roman Empire, the eclectic mix of high-quality works that passed along the Silk Route, the Bactrian Gold, excavated at Tilla-Tepe, which included over 20,000 items from the 1st century. The mix of Classical and oriental influence evident in the items forming the collection of Bactrian Gold demonstrates the creative fusion between cultures that has given the region its different character. These were built not only to worship the God but also for the sake of protecting their culture through arts for the knowledge of the future generations, for the sake of defensive activities during the times of wars and for storing grain seeds in the metal pots on the top of the Temples for regeneration of crops after droughts or great destructions.  More importantly, our forefathers had a very proper lifestyle, which demonstrates how wise and knowledgeable they were on their time. For the individual, they had planned four comprehensive stages of life such as, survival, awareness and harmony. Thus, for the society they had developed four types of duties to be carried out in order to sustain their social justice for the sake of living a proper life, such as to provide guidance to the kings with wise advices was the responsibility of the philosophers, 2. To protect the nation was the responsibility of the kings, 3. To enhance the wealth of the nation was the duty of the merchants and 4. To serve under them was the duty of the craftsmen. They were living a very integrated life with harmony, brotherhood and unity. Their life was simple but wisely advanced in every field of life, particularly in the field of architecture, arts, science, astronomy, mathematics, medicines and many other means for their survival.  Not to ignore the fact, our forefathers were not much affected by their civilization as of today. They didn't have problems as of now, such as extreme rate of unemployment, poverty, most dangerous diseases, economic backwardness, suicide-bombing and other inhuman acts of terrorism which are continuously hunting us and hitting us so hard. They were much civilized in their culture and did every effort to maintain and preserve their identity and culture that we are proud of today. But what so far we have done in response to their strife for our survival? Condemn and ignore their sacrifices for our survival and state that they were ignorant and couldn't do as of us. We destroyed their great achievements, such as great universities were demolished, wealth was plundered and temples were ruined to build up things of our own interest in the name of modern civilization or politics and religion. At their time, there were no borders and everyone was living a life free from boundaries, discrimination and annihilation. Their life was much more peaceful then now. They had a restful ways of life with honor, love and compassion.  Now let us see closely what so far our modern civilization has given us? Human freedom, a life worst than animals, human rights, beheading of the mankind, advancements of new disastrous nuclear bombs, the inventions of new technologies for transportation, communication and other destructive means of life? Do you mean these are to be called modern civilization? We have lost our conscience and moral in the name of modern civilization and become mad for gaining more. We ignore our parents, brothers, sisters, relatives and every part of our blood to satisfy our evil desire. We can't feel the pain and our hearts have become stones. Man to acquire more, rushes like mad after something which is not clear, is behaving in a strange manner creating new psychological problems and unbecoming of a human being in the modern world.  In fact, our so-called civilization is purely materialistic and hundred percent destructive. Spiritual values no longer govern the actions of people, in every walk of life. With the loss of spiritual faith, people have also lost their main supportive source of consolation in their distressing circumstances. There is an increasing dissatisfaction with each one's life. We do not know what to live for. Boredom with life and a feeling of ennui reflect our frame of mind. Thus a general restlessness prevails in our societies and rushes to bring further annihilations.  To put into a nutshell, I would like to add that only the economic and the scientific developments of the modern world, good dressings will not make modern man civilized. In today's so-called modern world, the problems like population explosions, high rates of unemployment, Extreme poverty, killer diseases, threat of war, and pollution of environment have improved much more than the ancient time. For that reason, true civilization should be based on the sound state of our mind, human love and not on madness and hatred. This doesn't mean that I completely ignore today's generation's creations. Indeed, that is appreciable and worth concerning. But these inventive and creative activities should be good, beautiful and excellent. The main point is, our inventions and creations should be useful and not harmful to mankind. They must protect the living creatures of all kinds. The earth is rich and there is room for everyone and we must protect it all together and that is the true meaning of modern civilization.","['civilized', 'mans', 'today', 'life', 'living', 'forefathers', 'todays', 'modern', 'civilization', 'ignore', 'great', 'face', 'evolution', 'world', 'true']","Now let us see closely what so far our modern civilization has given us?

Pollution: The World Threatening Issue,Opinion: Many governments and  individuals still underestimate air pollution warnings while it recognized as a biggest life threatening  enemy in the planet and likely to put the biggest brake on...,Mohammad Zahir Akbari,"December 20, 2016","Many governments and  individuals still underestimate air pollution warnings while it recognized as a biggest life threatening  enemy in the planet and likely to put the biggest brake on development in the  future. According to World Health Organization (WHO), there are around 3,000 cities in the world which badly affected by  air pollutions. Millions of people, including rich countries, are suffering from health issues such as  cancers, heart and respiratory diseases that air pollution brings, the levels  of air pollution in many Asian and African cities are said to be five or even  10 times worse. As ranked by WHO,  Mazar-e Sharif and Kabul are graded the ninth and tenth most polluted cities in  the world while Onitsha, a fast-growing city in Nigeria, got the first place in  the globe. 98% of these cities, around 92 per cent  of the world's population live in places where levels exceed recommended  limits. And around 6.5 million people die annually from air pollution.  In addition, the intensity of air pollution has increased by 8% in  the past five years. Levels of air pollution have reached toxic stage  particularly in some countries that the World Health Organization (WHO)  said it has become one of the world's biggest public health issues. Toxic  fumes have reached levels so dangerous that the number of annual deaths caused  by air pollution across the globe is now greater than those of Human  Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and malaria combined.   The quandary of toxic levels of air pollution or smog affects many  of the world's major cities in the world: from Kabul to Hong Kong and  Shijiazhuang in China and multiple cities in Latin America. In late 2015,  schools and offices were closed in China because of the toxic levels of smog  that lasted for weeks. In December 2015, a blanket of thick gray smog covered skies  in New Delhi, India. Tehran and Turkey also suffer tremendous levels of air  pollution, especially during winter.  Recently, Commerce minister Humayon Rasa, Head of National  Environment Protection Agency of Afghanistan, Mustafa Zahir, and Kabul Mayor  Abdullah Habibzai called in the Wolesi Jirga to answer lawmakers regarding  increasing of air pollution and trashes in Kabul city. Number of Parliament  member while calling air pollution a silent killer, said that non-asphalted  roads, low quality fuel, damaged cars, burning of substandard material by  different factories and houses are the main factor behind high level of  pollution in Kabul. They asked the related organs to exert utmost efforts to  control pollution in Kabul as soon as possible. Commerce minister Rasa said  that control of fuel is the duty of Afghanistan National Standard Authority,  which the ministry has no the right to interfere. He said that refineries in  the country has not the capacity to filter the fuel and produce fuel, thus it  is required of government to directly import fuel. Head of National Environment  Protection Agency of Afghanistan Mustafa Zahir said that 72 percent of  pollution is caused by vehicle and dusty roads, 31 percent by commercial and  personal institution burning substandard fire materials, 12 percent by brick  factories.  Kabul Mayor Abdullah Habibzai complained of lack of enough  equipment, facilities and staffs in Kabul. He said that our staff is for one  million populations but currently, the population increased to around six  million in Kabul. We need 600 vehicles, but only Kabul municipality have 170  vehicles, he noted. He said that Kabul municipality only had the capability to  transfer 30 percent of trashes. Kabul municipality work over privatization of  cleaning program of Kabul city, which will be implemented in coming two years,  he claimed. He insisted that by privatization of cleaning program of Kabul, the  problem of increasing of trashes will be solved. Substandard canalization  system and house, lack of greenery and lack of standard transportation system  are other challenges, which Kabul municipality will hold efforts to address the  issue in future, he underlined.  It seems that the  problem is rapidly worsening in Afghanistan, peculiarly in Kabul, due to  mentioned reasons and lack of a true controlling plan. Dozens of the citizens die each  year in Kabul while thousands others suffering from severe upper and lower  chest infections, including asthma, chronic bronchitis and heart disease due  the polluted weather. Reportedly, it caused 3,000 deaths last year whereas the  condition is worse comparing to previous year owing to expansion in previous  factors and additionally predicted less snow.  Though, People  complain resentfully today and the full health tragedy will not be seen for  many years. Because the effects of air pollution are chronic, or slow, they  build up in the body and impact mostly on older people. Children exposed to  heavy traffic fumes today will have smaller lungs and be more vulnerable to  respiratory and heart diseases in their later years. It means, if we  underestimate the issue now, we are storing up a health time-bomb for the  future, guaranteeing that hospital wards will be full of wheezing people with  hearts and lungs permanently damaged just by living in cities. The vast costs  to the economy of caring for an increasingly infirm older population will have  to be met later.  Lastly air-pollution crisis is not less important then  fighting terrorism. The municipality needs to work with private company for  rehabilitation of forests, ban the import and use of substandard fuel, improve  waste management and at the same time build and strengthen the institutional  capacity. It is also important to co-operate with the government in every  aspect of issue to overcome the dilemmas and enjoy a life free of silent enemy  such as air pollution and terrorist activities. The government is helpless to  approach a conclusion in fighting against the silent enemy (air pollution) and  terrorists, unless the people co-operate with it.","['health', 'pollution', 'cities', 'levels', 'municipality', 'issue', 'toxic', 'kabul', 'threatening', 'fuel', 'air', 'world']","Many governments and individuals still underestimate air pollution warnings while it recognized as a biggest life threatening enemy in the planet and likely to put the biggest brake on development in the future.
According to World Health Organization (WHO), there are around 3,000 cities in the world which badly affected by air pollutions.
In addition, the intensity of air pollution has increased by 8% in the past five years.
Because the effects of air pollution are chronic, or slow, they build up in the body and impact mostly on older people.
The government is helpless to approach a conclusion in fighting against the silent enemy (air pollution) and terrorists, unless the people co-operate with it."

Some Afghan vilified me for exposing the culture of male prostitution of the country but majority of my ...",Musa Khan Jalalzai,"July 14, 2011","In my last three articles on Child abuse and play boy business in Afghanistan, I 	highlighted the issue scrupulously with a limited details, but anyhow I received 	dozens of e-mails from Northern Afghanistan, Europe and Pakistan. Some Afghan vilified me for exposing the culture of male prostitution of the country but majority of my readers highly appreciated my shallow efforts. In fact, I have never been associated with any political or religious group in Afghanistan since 1964. I am a free tribal man of no political or sectarian background.  A background that elevated me to the skies is my intellectual and literary background which is my real asset. Last week, I came across a video on YouTube in which 12 years Old Persian speaking girl was crying of her injuries and bleeding in front of a local NGO. She was forcefully married to a criminal warlord who not only abused her; but severely tortured as well. Her weak and beautiful hand was bleeding and torn cloths were blood stained after she got knife injuries in the hand of her husband. ""Please help me get divorce, next time he will kill me, he injured me with a knife"". She was crying again and again with demanding attention, but her crying and dismal face disappointed me and I got high blood pressure for two days.  Northern Afghanistan has recently embroiled in many hazardous diseases like HIV/AIDS, male and female prostitution. The main factors behind these diseases are considered to be poverty and unemployment. Poverty, unemployment, illiteracy and the culture of militarization produced innumerable smugglers, prostitutes, suicide bombers and professional criminals across the country. Â   In Northern provinces, poverty stricken children are sexually abused, while in Pashtun dominated provinces, children are being recruited for suicide terrorism. This has now become an unfortunate culture of the country. Warlords in both Northern and Southern Afghanistan arrange parties, invite dancing boy and pay them for sex. As BBC reported the disturbing thing happens in the end of parties, is the boys are taken to hotels and sexually abused.  This ignominious practice is against the principles of Islam and against child rights. Child abuse in the country remained a big problem while illiterate parents are using their children in forced labor to pay off family debts. There are in ordinate cases of child abuse but only few are reported to the police. Parents don't want to report case of the abuse of their children to the police because they understand that police is already abusing innocent children in many ways.  According to the article 54 of the constitution of Afghanistan; ""Family is the fundamental unit of society and is protected by the state. The state shall adopt necessary measures to ensure physical and psychological well being of family, especially of child and mother, upbringing of children and the elimination of traditions contrary to the provisions of sacred religion of Islam.""  After the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, in the penal code of 1976 law is still in practice with various provisions. Article 398 sets punishment for honor killings, adultery, fornication and homosexuality. Article 427 describes long-term prison for adultery and also increases the available punishment if there is a ""violation of honor killing"". Afghan Constitution is only on papers, both the police and government neither official nor ordinary Afghan know about their country constitution.  Regretfully, being an Islamic country, the business of drugs, children and women trafficking, Bacha-Bazi and dancing clubs have undermined the so-called Afghani Ghairat, Pashtunwali and love to Islam. Bacha-Bazi is in no way acceptable in Islam while Islam is being misinterpreted in the country. Children have rights in Islam but they have no access to education, house, job, health and basic rights.  The streets of Afghan cities are full of working children, some polish shoes, some beg, some gather plastic bottles to resell and some are kidnapped for male prostitution. Last month, in Herat province, a 14 year old boy complained about his rape but didn't report to the police. Afghan hospitals are full of raped and abused children who receive medical treatment for their physical injuries. Article 427 of Afghanistan's penal code determines ""long term"" imprisonment for adultery. The article further elucidates that child abuser can be jailed for six to 10 years.  Normally, Bach-Bazi or child sex in the country is within the context of sexual acts with boys, in which adult men buy sexual favors from young boys with money or gifts. In this business, Private and pro-government militias have been found deeply involved. These Companies promote child recruitment and child abuse. Underage children are often abused sexually, tortured and put into hard labor. In many parts of the country, there are community-based militias of Bacha-Bazi addicted men such as the Afghan Local Police, in troubled provinces who have free hand and they do every thing whatever they want. Children in Afghanistan are suffering disastrous level of abuse; they are abused and insulted both in society and within homes. In Afghan prisons, they are tortured and raped. Torture and sexual assaults in Prisons presents a grim picture of scant respect for human rights.  The ways of torture of the Afghan police and security agencies are beating by stick, scorching bar, or iron bar; flogging by cable; battering by rod; electric shock; deprivation of sleep, water, and food; abusive language; sexual humiliation; and rape. Another painful story revealed by Wiki Leaks recently describes the involvement of foreign contractors in child abuse, training of Afghan policemen who take drugs and pay for young boys. Afghanistan's sex industry is booming, according to both private and official sources. Statistics are scattered, and few solid figures exist.  To address the issue properly, News and Media Radio reported (2011) Afghan government signed a formal agreement with the UN to ban the recruitment of children into the armed forces and stop the sexual abuse of young boys by the military commanders and warlords. The culture of play boy, dancing boy or Bacha-Bazi must be undermined, warned the UN.","['islam', 'humiliation', 'rape', 'afghan', 'children', 'child', 'afghanistan', 'boy', 'abuse', 'boys', 'sexual', 'country']","In my last three articles on Child abuse and play boy business in Afghanistan, I highlighted the issue scrupulously with a limited details, but anyhow I received dozens of e-mails from Northern Afghanistan, Europe and Pakistan.

The death of my compatriots chills me to the bone and compounds the  meaninglessness of life for me. I see the oozing blood of men, women and  children, I see mothers crying before the bloody corpse of their children, I  hear painful sobs but I also see people who are blind and deaf to all this . I see people bully one another; they torture  the defenseless people severely, oppress and shed the blood of innocent humans.  The weaker if a person is the more cruelty s/he will receive. Yes, in this  society “man is man’s wolf.” Men prey upon men. The human’s dignities and  values are the most meaningless words in this world. Oh my God, what a crying  shame!I see some old men taking their carts, with  shivering hands, to the bazaar in the early morning. Their gloomy faces reflect  their worry about the earnings of the day. I also see some children and aged  men who are collecting garbage, to burn for heating. I see some youth,  searching for jobs, who return home in frustration and disappointment. I see  some women and children shivering in winter. There are vendors who are unable  to make ends meet. I remember Mohamed Bou azizi, a Tunisian fruit vendor who  set himself on fire on December 17, 2010, in protest against unemployment. This  caused a wave of protest against oppression, government corruption and  inefficiency, across the Arab World. Then I ask myself, what if a person sets  himself on fire in this country, to protest the current situation. Will the  same revolution break out in our country? Of course, most of our people are dissatisfied  with the current government. Our country is on the top list of the most corrupt  countries, there is 36 percent rise in opium production, 38 percent rise in HIV  disease, 28 percent rise in violence against women, and the death toll among  civilians and the national police is getting higher. No one can tolerate such a  chaotic and disorderly situation. Isn’t it anarchy? Undoubtedly, we are  experiencing the exact meaning of anarchy in our country. Anarchy derives from  the Greek language. The prefix, an, denotes not or without. Anarchy denotes  rule, or ruling. Thus, anarchy means lawlessness; without rule. By this  definition, an anarchic government is a no government. This often happens after  a civil war, when a government has been destroyed and adversary groups are  fighting to take its place. John Milton defines anarchy as, “Anarchy is the  sure consequence of tyranny; or no power that is not limited by laws can ever  be protected by them.” Moreover, Jeremy Bentham says, “Tyranny and anarchy are  never far apart.” Cruelty and tyranny is rampant in our country.  On the one hand our officials consider themselves above the law and they are  corrupt. They violate the human rights. They usurp land, accept bribe, and  support the criminals. On the other hand, Taliban militants are destabilizing  the country and terrorizing people. They use many methods to kill innocent  Afghan civilians, male, female and children! Taking over power in Afghanistan  is their aim. In the patriarchal society of Afghanistan,  women suffer cruelties indoors and outdoors. Despite being busy with household  chores, they fall victim to inhuman acts such as physical torture, mutilation,  and even death. Their schools are still set on fire and in insecure parts of  the country; they do not dare go to school. Our culture, religious values and social norms  are eroding. Western culture has invaded Afghanistan, especially amongst our  younger generation. Our moral standards and values are being replaced by  outside ones. This is a cause of serious concern.When a country is in limbo, can we still claim  that we do not live in a state of chaos and anarchy? In my point of view, when  a country’s officials are corrupt, there will be no law and order. Cruelty and injustice are very prominent across  the country. If you have money or power, you will be idolized otherwise your  humanity will go under question. People are surrounded in the triangle of  power, possession and deception. Religious laws are debated in a hot manner;  however in practice they are ignored. Indeed, if religious values were  respected and practiced in their true forms, the society would not drop in such  an unlucky situation. Hence, religion is also marginalized from the personal  and collective life of our people. As far as religious laws and morality are  not brought back in active use, our society will not develop. John Foster  Dulles say very truly, “Economic and military power can be developed under the  spur of laws and appropriations. But moral power does not derive from any act  of Congress. It depends on the relations of a people to their God. It is the  churches to which we must look to develop the resources for the great moral  offensive that is required to make human rights secure, and to win a just and  lasting peace.”It is debated that we need a fundamental change  not only in politics but also in the social, cultural and educational fields. As the ambition for presidency wets the  appetite of our politicians, the situation may become worse. When the foreign  forces withdraw, insecurity will result. There may also emerge sectarian  violence and racial tension which might change the country into a battlefield. The deteriorating security situation has cast a  cloud over Afghan people. Civilians are losing their lives every week through  deadly attacks carried out by Taliban militants. The President seems  unconcerned about these matters! People are disappointed!I think it is still not too late for our  officials and political leaders to ask themselves why the country is so deep in  challenges. Why should Afghanistan be known as the most corrupt or the highest  opium producing country? Why, are challenges being compounded daily? Why the  situation is worsening? What are the solutions and what measures should be  taken to pull the country out of the current disorder?","['values', 'anarchy', 'laws', 'situation', 'anarchic', 'power', 'children', 'men', 'state', 'women', 'society', 'live', 'dont', 'country']","I see people bully one another; they torture the defenseless people severely, oppress and shed the blood of innocent humans.
I see some old men taking their carts, with shivering hands, to the bazaar in the early morning.
I also see some children and aged men who are collecting garbage, to burn for heating.
Then I ask myself, what if a person sets himself on fire in this country, to protest the current situation.
When a country is in limbo, can we still claim that we do not live in a state of chaos and anarchy?"
Kabul: Life Threatening Winter,Opinion: According to  Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kabul will get  less snow this winter but will see higher levels of pollution. They warn that  if Kabul residents...,Mohammad Zahir Akbari,"November 27, 2016","According to  Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kabul will get  less snow this winter but will see higher levels of pollution. They warn that  if Kabul residents do not pay special attention to what they use as fuel, the  pollution levels will increase and will cause more disease. In the past few  years, especially in the past few months, the percentage of patients with  pollution-related illnesses has increased. Officials from Indira Gandhi  Children's Hospital says about 200 children who suffer from respiratory  illnesses are brought to the hospital for treatment each day as a result of  increasing pollution. Therefore, the capital residents should be aware of life  threatening upcoming winter. However, the Ministry of Public Health says they  have plans to deal with the problem of pollution, should it increase. They say that  in cooperation with the EPA they will announce an emergency situation and  people will be banned from going to heavily polluted areas and schools will be  closed for a period of time.  The bitterly cold  winter can be more dreadful when imagine with the highest number of internal  and external displacements, homelessness, jobless, widespread production of  pollution and growing insecurity; since the start of the March, 2016 more than  450,000 people have been displaced in the country and thus the officials admit  their failure due to insufficient financial resources to meet the challenge. Statistics  show that currently the number of internally displaced people across the nation  is estimated to be over 1.2 million in total. And about one million people are expected to return to Afghanistan  by the end of March 2017 from Pakistan mainly due to tension strains increased  between two countries.   Frequently, Afghan capital city had been  recognized as one of the unhealthiest in the world, surrounded by hills that  trap pollution for days. The customary smoke producing fuels, old cars, lack of  standard roads, accumulation of garbage and overpopulations are counted as  major factors. Afghanistan’s capital, a city built for half a million people  but currently there are about four million people. Only 5 percent of Kabul’s  homes are connected to actual sewerage systems, while most household waste  flows straight into open roadside drains. Often their effluvia do not make it  far enough to join the floating hypodermic needles and assorted muck of the  Kabul River. According to health experts, air pollution is now the greatest  cause of death, killing thousands of people a year â more than from war,  terrorism, road accidents or HIV and Aids. Air pollution is also bad in other  Afghan cities such as Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad and Mazar.  In non-winter seasons, the emissions of old  cars reportedly cause 70 to 75 per cent of air pollution in Kabul. And yet,  tens of thousands of second-hand, substandard cars are imported every year, and  the resulting air pollution may lead to an estimated 3,000 yearly fatalities,  according to the Afghan Ministry of Health. In fact, Afghanistan has become a  junkyard for old cars. Import of old cars (anything over five years) need to be  banned. Those in the West who were going to pay $1,000 to impound their old  cars have now found a way to make $1,000 on those old cars by selling them to  people who ship them to Afghanistan, there should be strict control over the  exhaust pollution of cars. Regular technical checks must be imposed. Those who  don't pass emission tests must be heavily fined and the cars must not be issued  permits. Over the years, due to population growth and the increasing number of  such vehicles on the road, the problem has grown more challenging, and it is  viewed that everybody is now susceptible to [health hazards caused by] air  pollution in Kabul.  As reflected in UNEP former reports, most of  the fuels used in Afghanistan do not comply with international standards and  contain high levels of lead. Lead in the environment that poisons the brains of  Afghan children living in urban sprawls and reduces their learning ability and  other air pollutants that are threatening the public health every day, killing  many citizens every day. More than 70 per cent of the country's eastern and  southeastern forests have been cut down to export wood to feed neighboring  country highly lucrative lumber business - an enterprise that serves only  to line the pockets of Afghanistan's warlords-cum-statesmen. Moreover, the  mismanagement of pistachio forests has not only damaged the eco-balance in  northeastern parts of the country, but it has left tens of thousands without a  source of income. However, as per article 15 of Afghanistan's constitution, the  state is obligated to adopt necessary measures to protect and improve forests  as well as the living environment.   Finally, the fight against environmental pollution  is as much important as to fight against terrorism! Government has to update  the system of garbage collection, control of walking old cars from Kabul  streets, ban the import and use of substandard fuel, and as soon as possible  commence the new Kabul project to expand the city; Because a large population  produces a large amount of garbage, and with no systematic garbage collection  and garbage disposal result larger piles of garbage and pollution. Â On the other hand, public media, educational  system, civil society, police and etc must collaboratively work to promote the  culture of how to live in a city. We should be aware that lack of public  awareness and lack of culture of urban life is a big part of problem as here the  last thing on people’s minds is air quality and the environment.","['health', 'winter', 'kabul', 'life', 'city', 'old', 'million', 'cars', 'pollution', 'threatening', 'air', 'garbage', 'public']","According to Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Kabul will get less snow this winter but will see higher levels of pollution.

The Erosion of Moral Values,"Opinion: characteristic privilege is  that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social. He is  governed not by a material environment brutally imposed on him, but by ...",Hujjatullah Zia,"February 18, 2014","“Man’s characteristic privilege is  that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social. He is  governed not by a material environment brutally imposed on him, but by a  conscience superior to his own, the superiority of which he feels. Because the  greater, better part of his existence transcends the body, he escapes the  body’s yoke, but is subject to that of society.” Emile Durkheim. She was about 65 years old talking  with a burst of emotion in a street of Kabul City. A strong feeling was easily  noticeable in her tone of voice. Five passersby gathered her listening. She  said with painful heart that a man took her money to bring her a tin of oil and  disappeared. “It is about two hours that I have been waiting for him, but he is  not back yet. I was given the money by my stepson. If I return home with empty  hand, he will kick me out of home.” She said to the passersby. “He has swindled  you.” Said one of the onlookers and they all left her alone. The drops of tear sparkled in her  eyes and she was standing with despondency and chagrin. Although, she was  smoldering with pain, no one felt the flames of her burning emotions. Her face  was reflecting her great worry and disappointment. But was it people’s  business?This story demonstrated three major  problems which are rife in our society. First, cruelty and violence against  women was easily noticeable in her words. She was greatly worried about being  treated harshly or even being kicked by her stepson. Moreover, bigamy is a  usual tradition in our society which mostly leads to domestic violence. In  other words, a bigamist man frequently treats his old wife unfairly. Therefore,  the Afghan women suffer mentally and physically from this issue. Nelson Mandela says very beautifully,  “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every  woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity  and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex, we condemn to a  lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our  women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.”Secondly, poverty is one of the  major problems being suffered by Afghan people and paving the way for crime and  corruption. For instance, administrative corruption, robberies and theft and cultivating  narcotic drugs are highly prominent in our society which originates from  poverty. This chronic problem has challenged the lives of thousands of Afghan  people. In addition, moral codes and  religious laws are eroding. Religious values are deeply marginalized in our individual  and collective life. People are involved in criminal activities such as  robbery, theft, swindling, deceiving, hypocrisy, etc.Â  Humanity is threatened to death by human  beings. Our feet are tightly chained by our  worldly desires. We trample upon the rights of our own fellow without feeling a  tinge of guilt. The people’s main claim to fame is to gain self-interests at  the cost of their moral codes and religious beliefs. Our bodies may be free,  but our souls are the real prisoners of our whims and lusts. Hence, human empty  of humanity is the disease of our society and century. Albert Einstein says very aptly, “A  human being is part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time  and space. We experience ourselves, our thoughts and feelings as something  separate from the rest. A kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This  delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and  to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free  ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all  living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. The true value of a  human being is determined by the measures and the sense in which they have  obtained liberation from the self. We shall require a substantially new manner  of thinking if humanity is to survive.” Unfortunately, nowadays nobody feels  a sense of devotion and co-operation. If a neighbor or a member of the same  society is knee-deep in a difficulty, the other members just ignore inhumanly.  Dedication is construed as idiocy and the more dishonest one is the more clever  s/he is called. In short, moral standards are metamorphosed. Therefore, this is  a great tragedy. As human beings, aren’t we supposed to share our joys and pains? Sharon Sequeira says, “If for some  reasons one of us is having a genuine difficulty in accomplishing our task, it  is important for the others to pitch in and help out in order that the wheels  of progress are not slowed down or stopped. Just imagine for a second how an  automobile cannot move if we get a flat in one of the tires even though the  remaining three tires are fine.” Sharon talks about being committed in our  tasks and carrying out our responsibilities in the best possible way saying,  “We constantly must be aware that we should be doing our work diligently if we  only for a moment think that we are doing our tasks to the best of our ability  to please our God. Hence, irrespective of whether we are being observed by our  peers or superiors we should be doing our best to complete our tasks to the  best of our abilities.” It is  worthy of mention to say that when one lacks moral standards and religious  boundaries, prevailing law will not be respected. I believe that the role of  moral standards in one is the strongest factors that can stop from committing crime.  However, if morality dies in the soul of a nation, then crime will rise. I  conclude that trampling upon moral standards and religious instructions will  lead to crime and corruption in a society.","['values', 'religious', 'standards', 'crime', 'best', 'humanity', 'moral', 'erosion', 'women', 'society', 'woman', 'human']","“Man’s characteristic privilege is that the bond he accepts is not physical but moral; that is, social.

There has been always a link between hunger and global security. Fighting to end hunger among the nations worldwide is the first most important step in ensuring the global security and even achieving peace among the nations. Perhaps, there could be no permanent global peace as long as two-third of our human families is daily under the dominant of world's worst killers, ""Hunger"" and famine. In fact, hunger and Insecurity are the worst threat to peace and security.   Who are the poor? Countless numbers of babies who are born in poor parents have grown up as poor. Many became poor due to hard circumstances that dominated Afghanistan in the last decades of war and constant drought. Most of them belong to those families whose breadwinners died, murdered, massacred or became permanently disabled in the fight against Taliban or in civil war. When everything most of the families own is lost in a natural disaster or in a communal violence. When one's possessions are taken away because one is powerless, voiceless or unable to repay money borrowed to farm a land or to pay for a girl's dowry or to pay for curing a killer illness. When one is born with disability and no one is ready to support the disabled. When the head of a household suffers from unemployment and can't earn enough to fulfill the gap. They are the common faces of poverty in Afghanistan.  Kabul has been dominated by various threats and challenges in the past decades due to unbroken war, and other evils such as discrimination, hunger and famine. As a result, thousands of families left the country and immigrated to neighboring countries for their survival. As, Afghanistan is steeped in bold challenges, there is another growing threat to both its political and social stability ""Hunger"". Beggers are increasing on Kabul streets, children and women are in grave situation and yet there has not been any single concern over this crisis; neither by Afghan government nor by any other humanitarian NGO on the ground.   Our respected government authorities have not even insight about the situation, because they have never seen the worst face of hunger in their whole life time. Perhaps, they never bother to walk down once on the streets so that they would become aware of the sufferings that this war-torn nation faces. Why even bother with poverty? The region faces major issues like, terrorism, communal violence, HIV/AIDS, restless youth, deforestation, worst ever pollution, road accidents, shortages, corruption, fighting, unstable neighbors, Taliban-led insurgency and so on.   Let's begin with the poor, voiceless and powerless parent's children who from early morning till midnight are running about the streets, asking the drivers to clean their cars for one Afghani, and asking for alms from the people on the streets. Most of them are malnourished and seldom receive nutritious food. Hunger and famine damage their brain and retard both their mental and physical growth.   They are deprived from getting education and other social benefits. Later, when they grow up, they remain weak, get frequently sick, and have little or no education at all for choosing the right path towards a better and sustainable future just like rich citizens.   Similarly, this nation has repeatedly indentified poor and unemployed and these are the driving forces behind insecurity and instability. According to a recent Oxfam study, ""seventy percent of Afghans surveyed face poverty and unemployment, as the major cause of the conflict in the region."" Some people participate in insurgent activities to acquire an income. Joining anti-government oppositions or undertaking other illegal activities, such as drug production and trafficking, is often more well-paid, and with immediate returns, than struggling with farming or working in the informal sector for low wages while a fortunate daily laborer earns a maximum of 4$ a day.   Moreover, this is broadly believed that poverty in Afghanistan is both a cause and a consequence of the exclusion faced by a high proportion. The everyday reality on streets and pathways are obscured by poverty statistics is that the people are often hungry and that they have limited access to health care. Most of them cannot read or write and some may even sell a child, probably a girl to feed the rest of the family. Their children are begging or working instead of going to school, and they are more vulnerable to violence as they lack the protection that patronage corruption and alternative security arrangements.  There are debates in every official meeting and conference on how to confront the Taliban or other insurgent fighters or invest on short-term development process. But fighting hunger and helping the poor and voiceless people has never been under the debate or if it was, yet nothing helpful has happened as this persistently continues to affect the lives of people and security situation in the region. Local people due to hunger are joining the Taliban or other fighting groups. While the government authorities are talking about the rise in insecurity, they must understand that investment on poor families may guarantee a permanent peace and stability.   This investment means better educated societies, more stable societies and the chance for better economic growth. Escalation of food aid in Afghanistan, means reducing the level of death, insecurity and other killer disease, which are the cause for illegal earnings due to lack of access to basic food services, unemployment and hunger. Perhaps, Afghanistan doesn't need guns for killing, but rather food and education through which they can kill the killer ""Hunger"".   Today poverty and hunger kill more Afghans than those of armed conflicts or suicide bombers. The region has the world's second-highest maternal mortality rate, the third-highest child mortality rate.   Therefore, if we do not help the infants and toddlers of the poor, we will end up supporting youths and adults of poor competence. And this creates a problem. When a poor child grows up to be an adult, he/she will likely remain uneducated, untrained and unemployed for the rest of his/her life. Surrounded by such circumstance, these adults can be persuaded to carry out violent acts or become terrorists or undertake unhealthy or dangerous activities that will create both social and political unrest in a region as of now and this will likely portend both social and political unrest and drive the nations into Stone Age.   In fact, poverty is paralyzing Afghanistan. The world must pay more attention towards it. The debates on peace process and other political issues have long been going on but they have persuaded no convenient achievement, instead worsen the situation. Now is the time that the government and the international community pay little more attention on fighting the poverty. The region will lose more individuals if the international community and other donating organizations on the ground keep silent. All those who feel responsible for protecting a life, now is the time to take an initiative for saving the lives of Afghan children, women and families who live in grave hunger.","['streets', 'suffer', 'fighting', 'families', 'peace', 'continue', 'afghanistan', 'hunger', 'worst', 'afghans', 'region', 'poverty', 'poor']","They are the common faces of poverty in Afghanistan.

At times, it  ...",Mohammad Rasool Shah,"December 08, 2013","With the announcement of the sad demise of Nelson Mandela,  world recalled the great lessons given by him. He spent more than 25 years in  prison but he never lost his faith on his cause. At times, it looked as if it  will all end without any result because he was getting old and the scenario did  not appear to have changed a lot but he never gave up. He gave the lesson of  complete devotion and dedication to the world. He was a true picture of the  saying that, ‘suffering breeds character. Character breeds faith and in the  end, faith will not disappoint.’ Even after so many sufferings, he decided to forget those  who did all these and did not even think of avenging. It was also necessary as  he had to keep the nation united and did not reverse the flow of emotions from  blacks to the whites. It was the reason why, no violence erupted when  transition of power came and centuries’ old system was smoothly and peacefully  replaced. When he was elected the first black president of South  Africa, he left an example of following the path of democracy by quitting his  post after his first term and gave chance to others to take the lead of the  country. It is very rare in African continent and to some extent, in other  parts of the world that leaders hardly show willingness to leave the power and  promote the healthy democratic practices in this regard. Then he turned his  attention towards those humanitarian and welfare which the poor and  calamity-hit people of this country badly needed. He started work on different  projects like controlling HIV Aids, and providing the basic education to the  children of the backward areas of the country. When we look at his life, the years of suffering and difficulties  are more than that of the success but he had a firm belief in himself and his  cause; to make South Africa a country where people would avail all the rights  without any discrimination. This noble cause always kept his spirits high and  he never gave up; however hard the conditions maybe.once he had to resort for a limited armed struggle as well  because he was left with no other option and he was criticized by the West as  well but now they realize that they were wrong and Mandela was correct as it  was a temporary phase in his struggle and later on he showed that he was the  true believer of peace and dialogue.Nelson Mandela was born in a land where a minority of white  people had deprived a vast minority of black people from their rights in their  own land. Majority of blacks lived in villages or rural areas where the light  of education had never reached and enlightened their minds. They were never a  danger for the ruling group as they could have never realized their condition  and demanded any kind of right. Very small minority of the blacks was residing  in urban settlements and cities but then there were present many restrictions  on them.Special passes were issued for them, and anyone who wanted to  travel to any other part of the country had to take prior permission from the  court, and was badly punished if found without his pass. Blacks had no right to vote and elect the representatives of  their own and they were lead by the chiefs who were mainly the elected  representatives of the central government. These chiefs kept their status and  position dear to anything else and thus they were the biggest barriers in the  way of progress of their own fellow citizens. Blacks had no right of property and time and again, the  central government passed laws that gave the rights to whites to snatch and  dislocate the blacks from their lands and towns. Similarly, blacks had no share in government offices, or  other prestigious or important posts. They could hardly become an office clerk  or a schoolteacher but they were never let to make access to important posts.Similarly, they had almost no share in the business of the  country and they worked on meager wages in mines administered and owned by  their white masters.But most painful was that, they had no social status or  respect. They were treated as second-class citizens in their own land.In such suffocating circumstances, some Africans had started  dreaming of a free land. Almost all the Africans who could see and feel this  situation were in pain and there was a fire burning in their hearts and heads  but they could do nothing as they were facing an enemy very strong and cunning.  Every way was blocked for them and they were left with every limited choice.Nelson Mandela joined African National Congress (ANC) that  was working for the freedom of blacks. Like any other great leader, he suffered  a lot right from the beginning. He opened the black law firm in Johannesburg  that aimed at the service of oppressed black people. He was an active member of his party and always believed in  peaceful struggle but their efforts did not bring out any result as government  strictly and harshly crushed their struggle.Then he co-founded and led the armed wing of African National  Congress (ANC) but they always tried not to harm the public and not violate the  human rights. Right from the beginning, he was repeatedly banned or  imprisoned. His passes were banned and many a times, he was expelled from different  cities. In 1964, he was sentenced for a lifetime imprisonment and was sent to  prison in Robben Island where he spent eighteen years of 27 years long  imprisonment. Due to the international pressure, Mandela was released in 1990.  As a result of first multi-racial elections of 1994, ANC won 62% votes and  Nelson Mandela was elected as the first black president of the country. In  1999, after the completion of his term, he decided not to stand for the second  term and retired himself for the welfare work, in and outside his country.Few things include him among the greatest leaders of the  world. He emerged from a very poor background (his father’s friend brought him  up when he was left as an orphan at the age of 9). He never got disappointed  with the adverse conditions. Many times, he was left all alone and difficulties  had ceased his way completely but this could only make him slow down for a  while and then start his efforts with a renewed energy and spirit. Had there  been anyone else in his place, he could have easily given up but he was a  person who was alien to the concepts of disappointment and retreat.Secondly, he was always in favor of education. He continued  his disrupted education in the prison and completed his Bachelor of Law from  the University of London via correspondence. Later on, he introduced many  reforms to promote education in the country. During his presidency and the terms  followed by his successors, the expenditure on education substantially  increased. Compulsory education was introduced for African children between  ages of six to fourteen and 3.5 to 5 million schoolchildren were provided with  free meals.In different regions of the world, the spirit of leaders and  members of a nation exist until the freedom is achieved and mostly the leaders  are found to be having no concrete plans after the freedom. This was not the  case with Nelson Mandela. After he became president and in the terms followed  by his fellows, many laws were introduced that were aimed to bring social  equality, justice and reforms to decrease the gap between the rich and poor. He  and his followers introduced a number of successful reforms to decrease poverty  and make the condition of public stable.He was not a person who wanted to enjoy the power so when he  saw that a democratic system of government was able to run the country successfully;  he decided not to stand for the second term of presidency when he could have  easily become the president.People are busy in praising this great man of change and  equality but his teachings would only be effective if we all try to understand  and adopt them.

"Afghanistan: Child Sex,  BachaBazi and DynCorp","Opinion: In recent two e-mails I received from the parents of two teenage girls who were forcefully married 	to wealthy and powerful war criminals in Northern Afghanistan, they have painted heart-broken 	stories of their innocent daughters' torture, humiliation and imprisonment by their ignorant husbands. Sajida and Rashida were barely ...",Musa Khan Jalalzai,"July 12, 2011","In recent two e-mails I received from the parents of two teenage girls who were forcefully married 	to wealthy and powerful war criminals in Northern Afghanistan, they have painted heart-broken 	stories of their innocent daughters' torture, humiliation and imprisonment by their ignorant husbands. Sajida and Rashida were barely 12 years old at the time of their marriage. The story, though interesting but ignominious. I am not going to comment it in detail as I have limited space here.  The recent sale of two more Afghan girls in separate incidents in the hands of war criminals has sparked concern about the protection of young girls in Northern Afghanistan. Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission has received hundreds complaints about the sale of teenage girls in Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kunduz, Jaozjan, Shiberghan, Baghlan, Samangan and Takhar provinces. In Takhar province, a nine year old girl was sold for just 240 dollars while in Baghlan, 11 years old girl was sold to a Tajik warlord for only 300 dollars.  Sex trade and male prostitution has brought disgrace and shame to Afghanistan. Sex trade and male prostitution has taken deep roots in the country after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. The Persian word, Bacha-Bazi means ""boy play"" or ""boy for play.""Â  As per its conservative nature, in Afghan society, women either prostitute or professional are not allowed to perform dance among the male parties, therefore, in all parties arranged by warlords and their cronies, play boys are lured to dance all the night.Â   Warlords in Northern Afghanistan, according to press reports, recruit young boys for sex and dance, while local authorities remain powerless in stopping the practice. Bacha-Bereesh of ages 15 to 20 are normally dressed in women cloths, dancing all the night then abused by several men.  The issue is very complicated. According to press reports, more than one hundred thousands Afghan men and women are suffering from HIV and Aids. Local warlords in Northern Afghanistan don't even know about the fatal consequences of prostitution and sex trafficking business. There is huge increase in the number of sex workers in the country. US Department of State report (2007) has placed Afghanistan as a source, transit, for women, and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation. In Afghanistan, local and foreigner women serve both Afghans and foreigners in guesthouses and brothels. Under the Afghan law, sex trade and prostitution is often considered adultery, which is punishable by five to 15 years in prison.  Recent investigative reports have revealed some facts and figures about the play boy hobbies in Pashtun majority provinces. Pashtun transport mafia is deeply involved with the business and every two in ten Pashtun truck drivers are involved in male prostitution. In Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, Zabul, Kandahar, Khost,Quetta, Bannu and Waziristan male prostitution is not considered an illegal custom. Every young and old man, if they want can have a boy.  Recently I was told by one of my Afghan friends in London that some Afghan male prostitutes have claimed asylum in the UK due to the fear of their persecution in returning to Afghanistan. They are sexually abused, and they are even bought and sold. Fights take place over these Bacha-Bbereesh. It's increasing day by day, and it's catastrophic. To dress up their actions, the men involved in sex trade often insist these boys are to be dressed up in women's clothing and dancing in front of groups of paying men. Man-boy homosexuality has flourished anew in the aftermath of Taliban zero-tolerance laws, albeit a selectively punished offence in that era. Afghan boys are mostly turn to sex work and a life on the streets because they were fleeing something worse at home. In the past, Brothels were openly allowed in the street of Kabul and they openly enjoyed this business. Islam doesn't allow such a practice and count it as one of the most sinful acts. Afghan Ulema are of the opinion that making boys dance and sexually abuse is not allowed in Islam. Afghan police officers are deeply involved in male prostitution while Interior Ministry in Kabul has recently received thousands complaints from locals regarding the police sexual attacks on young boys.  An intelligence website, Wikileaks recently released a cable from Afghanistan revealing U.S. government contractor DynCorp involvement in playboy business. DynCorp is a company of private militia training Afghan police force. According to recent reports, more than ninety five percent budget of the militia comes from the US and part of that is being spent on child abuse parties and sex trafficking in Northern Afghanistan.  To meet the sexual needs of the Afghan police officers, in December 2010, as WikiLeaks Cable reported DynCorp purchased young boys for Afghan policemen. The boys were to be used in Bacha-Bazi. DynCorp members and officers have already been engaged in sex with 12 to 15 year old children, and sold them to each other as slaves in Bosnia. After the WikiLeaks revelations about the DynCorp involvement in sex trade in Northern Afghanistan, Afghan Interior Ministry carried out a thorough investigation against the private militia company.  The investigation resulted in the arrest of two Afghan police and nine other Afghans for the crime of ""purchasing a service from a child.""The US State Department began its own investigation whether DynCorp had ignored signs of drug abuse among employees in Afghanistan or not, but Inspector General of the State Department in its report concluded that dancing boy incident is no criminal activity in Afghanistan.  This shameless practice has also prompted Defense Department of the United States to hire a social scientist, Anna Maria to investigate the problem, as several US soldiers on patrol often passed older men walking hand-in-hand with pretty young boys. There are thousands young boys undergone ordeals. But actual numbers of these vulnerable boys are not known.","['afghan', 'northern', 'child', 'afghanistan', 'young', 'women', 'male', 'dyncorp', 'boys', 'prostitution', 'sex', 'bachabazi']","Sex trade and male prostitution has brought disgrace and shame to Afghanistan.

Afghan women continue to be victim of domestic and sexual violence by warlords, war criminals and private militia commanders. During the last three months, I have been...",Musa Khan Jalalzai,"July 04, 2011","The heart breaking stories of help	less, poor and vulnerable girls and women of Afghanistan are making headlines in print and electronic media across Europe these days. Afghan women continue to be victim of domestic and sexual violence by warlords, war criminals and private militia commanders. During the last three months, I have been receiving e-mails from some helpless Afghan women about their heart breaking stories of forced marriages. In their e-mails letters, they complain that rape is not considered as a serious crime in the country, if a woman reports a rape case to the police investigation began about her character.  One of the e-mails I received last week from Takhar province describes the story of two small girls and a woman raped by armed men onÂ June 15, 2011. A six-year old girl was also among the victims. However, twenty days ago, a 15-year-old girl was gang-raped by five armed men in Kalifgan district. Afghan Human rights official says that last year; more than 2,765 cases of violence against women and girls were reported to the rights watchdog while Fawzia Amini, of the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs revealed that some 6,765 cases of violence against women and girls were registered in 2010.  The three decades long civil war, foreign interventions, poverty, unemployment, militarization, ignorance, knife and gun culture and political rivalries are factors making the women and children of Afghanistan vulnerable to trafficking, prostitution and playboy business. Afghanistan shares borders with Iran, Pakistan, China and Central Asian States and offers an environment for facilitating the business of women, children and drug trafficking.  Majority of Afghan children, women and girls trafficked in and outside the country are being sold in the local prostitution markets or in the hands of wealthy individuals, warlords and private militia commanders. UNICEF in its report revealed that fifty seven percent of Afghan marriages involve girls under sixteen. Insecurity, fear of kidnapping and rape has also prompted many families to force their young daughters into marriage.  In Northern Afghanistan, and in parts of Southern provinces, the same story is repeated. In various districts of Northern provinces, poor and poverty stricken girls and children are being kidnapped and sold into prostitution. Unemployed and poor young boys have also been subjected to trafficking for male prostitution, forced labor and playboy business. The traditions of child marriage have long been practiced in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's civil war left hundreds of thousands women widow and young children orphaned. As matrimonial life is much expensive across the country, specifically, in Paktika and Paktia provinces, the price for a young girl has been fixed more than three millions in Afghan currency.  Education for girls in these provinces is considered to be a great sin while sports and other hobbies are not allowed. Majority of Afghan girls became pregnant before they reach physical maturity because they don't know about the family law of the country. The Afghan Civil Law sets the minimum age for marriage at sixteen for girls and at eighteen for boys.  A heart-breaking story of an Afghan girl who was sold again and again in the hands of criminal mafia groups is indicative of the increasing violence against women. A young girl of poor parents, Benazir was twelve years old when she was forcefully married to an illiterate man. She remained with him for nine years and had four children. After nine years, her husband sold her to a human trafficker.  He kept her for a month, and sold to another man, two month later she was sold to a fourth man and after a year she was resold to a criminal. What happened to Benazir, nobody knows but Benazir is not the only victim of war criminals in her country, there are thousands of women and girls in Afghanistan whose lives are in danger. Cases of rape are in thousands, torture and domestic violence in Northern Afghanistan is being encouraged by mafia groups.  Recently, in Balkh Province, a teenage girl was kidnapped, tortured and raped by a warlord. This was a great shame for her family. Her parent decided to kill her but a local NGO saved her life. Brothels in Mazar-e-Sharif, Balkh, Laghman, Samangan and Kunduz provinces openly campaign for young girls. As they have strong support from the war criminal partners and corrupt officials in the police department, they freely run their businesses. Neither have they taught people about HIV virus nor about AIDs. Consequently, over one hundred thousand people are suffering from HIV virus in Afghanistan.  Another profitable business which has attracted thousand of criminal elements and warlords is playing with boys or ""having sex with boys"". This is an old and ugly tradition of Afghanistan. Orphan and poor children are picked from the streets or purchased from their parents who agree to sell them to those wealthy males who are fond of homosexuality. The parents are normally agreed on a ""good price"" for their child.  It seems neither illegal nor the police show any interest to intercept it. In Kandahar, and parts of Northern Afghanistan, Afghan married and unmarried men love boys roughly 15 to 20 years old. The price of a young and beautiful boy has been fixed up to 100,000 Afghanis. ""Keeping a beautiful boy has become a custom in Kandahar now,"" a Kandahari homosexual once told me. When we study the poetry books in Kandahar or in any province in the North, we come across many poems about homosexuality.  Male prostitution has not been considered a harmful business in Afghanistan since decades. Though, keeping a playboy or Bacha Berish (a boy without beard) is not illegal but thousands wealthy people, businessmen and criminal gangs are involved with playboys across the country since long. After the US invasion in 2001, sex trafficking in the country becomes a profitable business. One of my police friends recently told me that more than 3000 families in Jawzjan, Mazar, Kunduz, Herat, Samangan and Faryab provinces have been involved in prostitution since last ten years. The main factor behind this business he told me is poverty and unemployment.","['play', 'girls', 'marriages', 'afghan', 'business', 'forced', 'children', 'afghanistan', 'boy', 'young', 'women', 'prostitution', 'provinces', 'sold', 'country']","Afghan women continue to be victim of domestic and sexual violence by warlords, war criminals and private militia commanders.

Indian Finance and Revenue Secretary R.S. Gujral said the development in Afghanistan had critical implications for 'the long term security of our region and the world'.  Latest information indicates a seven percent increase in opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to 131,000 hectares.   'Though some progress in tackling the problem has been achieved, the medium term indicators of opium produced are not positive. The amount of opium produced has risen from 3,600 tons in 2010 (mainly owing to opium diseases that affected opium crop) to 5,800 tons in 2011,' Gujral said.  Afghan opium kills 100,000 people every year globally.  'The problem of drug addiction and diseases spread by intravenous injections such as HIV-AIDS in most participating countries indicates worrying trends that should provide an incentive for all governments to consider drug abuse as an integral part of public health policies and to deal with it at regional and international level,' Gujral said.  He was speaking at the second meeting of heads of national drug law enforcement agencies of the Asia and Pacific region.  Christina Albertin, resident representative the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, drew attention to Nepal saying it was becoming a conduit for drugs supply to China.   She highlighted the conditions in the Maldives, which she said was becoming a major drug consumer.  Gujral told IANS: 'Authorities in Afghanistan have been regularly briefed. We are coordinating action with them. More important is to cut the supply lines and prevent new conduits from opening.'","['producing', 'drug', 'produced', 'opium', 'tons', 'official', 'afghanistan', 'term', 'problem', 'supply', 'nepal', 'gujral']","AGRA - Delegates taking part in a four-day conclave of heads of drug law enforcement agencies here voiced concern over the increase in the area under opium cultivation in Afghanistan.

About Us

The launch of the new Outlook Afghanistan internet-based news service is an important step for the Afghanistan Group of Newspapers. We also believe that it is significant in the progress of our country. Our Group is proud to be part of the process of developing a democratic Afghanistan. After three decades of conflict and power struggles, only freedom of expression offers the people of Afghanistan a sense of having a stake in governing this country. Every day of the week we in the Afghanistan Group work to consolidate this hard-won freedom and build the popular foundation of Afghan democracy.

Our approach in the Afghanistan Group is informed by experience of the role of media in development internationally and in the history of our country. The hallmark of our publications is that they are independent, professional, informed by a national vision and globally connected.

People living in established democracies take it for granted that the media serve as the fourth pillar of state. Protection of freedom of expression is fundamental to the constitution of countries like the United States. There the media hold democratic politicians accountable. They inform citizens and politicians alike and thrive on political debate, whether at local or national level. Any professional journalist has studied the famous cases in which the printed word has been the downfall of rulers who had become contemptuous of their people and their laws.

Afghans have experienced every form of tyranny and take none of these freedoms for granted. As we make our difficult transitions, struggling for security and political stability, Afghanistan needs vibrant media more than ever before. But in its history of 130 years, the print media in the country mostly remained under firm government control. Successive narrowly based regimes used media as a mouthpiece, offering citizenry a distorted, propagandist view of reality. The Taliban regime for its part strangled the media, destroying infrastructure, burning archives, banning photography and stopping woman journalists from working. Afghans will not tolerate a return to those days and nurturing independent media is fundamental to the struggle for peace.

Superficially there has been rapid progress, with hundreds of newspapers, periodicals and magazines born since 2001. But most of them are amateurish, run on a shoestring and lack the capacity to engage in real news-gathering. Even more worryingly, many of the new media organs are owned by power brokers and government figures, and so are tied to the new governing elites.

Our group's flagship publication is the Daily Outlook Afghanistan, the country's pioneering English language publication. After a period of consultation, we launched it to fill an important niche in the market. On the one hand a new generation of Afghans has a global perspective and is comfortable inter-acting with the world through English. Young men and women in Kabul University and the provinces and Afghans in international organizations and business are empowered by their use of English. Meanwhile, foreigners working in Afghanistan need access to up to date information on public affairs, reconstruction and security but do not necessarily trust the government version as the last word on anything important. The Daily Outlook aims to be the daily newspaper on the desk of all those who want to read on Afghanistan in English.

The newspaper covers national, regional and international developments with daily editorials and articles on important issues. On Sundays, the paper publishes an additional «Weekend Special» covering political, health, science, politics, culture, cross-cutting issues like gender, HIV/AIDS, environment, youth affairs, sports and showbiz. We have received appreciation from friends in the United Nations, diplomatic missions, educational institutions, civil society and even government. We are delighted that our pages offer a show case for Afghan democratic opinion. Astute observers of the Afghan scene, trying to keep up with the public debate, look first to the Daily Outlook. Our paper has offered some of the hardest hitting coverage of corruption, electoral fraud, security blunders, regional diplomacy and the realities of governance.

The Afghanistan Group also publishes in Pashto and Dari. It launched ""the Daily Afghanistan"" on September 06, 2006. This paper has built on the Daily Outlook's reputation for professionalism and has achieved distinction with the biggest circulation of any daily newspaper in the country. We are proud to have won the trust of readers in both English and the national languages.

Not only do our publications provide the best news coverage available to an Afghan readership, we have developed a truly national distribution network, to ensure access for readers across the country. Our network distributes across Kabul and the provinces of Afghanistan. Our bureau offices operate in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, in the eastern city of Jalalabad and in historic Ghazni. We are continuously working to expand our news-gathering and distribution networks throughout Afghanistan.

The 7 billionth person will be born into a world that is very different from when the United Nations was founded in 1945, when our numbers were only about a third of what they are today.We are living 30 per cent longer. More of our children survive. We are now more urban. We are more interconnected and interdependent than ever.  The 7 billionth person will also be born into a world of contradictions. While most people are having smaller families, our numbers grow globally. While some poor countries' populations are growing more quickly than their economies, the populations of some rich countries are shrinking, threatening to undermine economic growth. There are more young people in the world, but there are also more elderly.   The population of Afghanistan is very young with only 30% of the population being 25 years or older and is growing at a rate that will double its present size in less than thirty years if the present levels of fertility are maintained.   The challenges ahead are formidable, with new pressures on land, energy, food and infrastructure and on the governments that must provide services, such as education and health, and with the global economic crisis shaking the foundations of individuals, families and communities.  We canâand mustâconfront these challenges. But we must act now. What we do today can have a profound impact on the lives of people everywhere tomorrow and for generations to come.We have to protect our environment, provide clean water and energy and enough food, and address the threat of climate change.  We have to rectify inequalities between women and men, girls and boys. We must change attitudes so that violence or discrimination against women and girls becomes unacceptable everywhere. We must ensure girls have the same educational opportunities as boys. We must continue work against skewed sex ratios.  We also need to make motherhood safe. That means caring for pregnant women, preventing deaths in childbirth, and providing nutrition to mothers and babies.Millions of mothers must still give birth without help from a skilled birth attendant.  And millions more have little or no say in basic decisions about how many children they have or when to have them. An estimated 215 million women in the developing world lack access to modern family planning.  We have seen the impressive difference that midwives can make in their communities and we are pleased to see that the Ministry of Public Health in Afghanistan developed and approved the first country specific policy and strategy for Nursing and Midwifery Services. This is an important step in Afghanistan's impressive efforts to increase the percentage of births attended by skilled birth attendants.   About a quarter of the world's people are between the ages of 10 and 24. We used to say our youth will be the leaders of the futureâbut, as we have seen in many parts of the world, we now know that they are already leaders of today.   Young people have the potential to transform economies, politics, and whole societies. They have the potential to drive development through their creativity, ideas, enthusiasm, and innovative spirit. However, in order for this potential to be realized, governments, UNFPA and the wider United Nations should take steps to ensure our youth populations are healthy and have access to education, including sexuality education, so they may understand how to protect themselves from HIV and have the knowledge to make informed decisions. Girls who stay in school are less likely to have unintended pregnancies, are healthier, and more economically productive in adulthood.  We must ensure that our youth have jobs and opportunities for sustainable livelihoods. Today, only about half of the world's youth participate in the labour force, and almost everywhere, young women have fewer job opportunities than men do. Investments in young people's education, health and employment can enable countries to build a strong economic base and reduce poverty, a key aim of the Millennium Development Goals.  In Afghanistan people less than 25 years old make up almost 70 percent of the total population. By investing in their health and education Afghanistan will be in a better position to generate the kind of returns that will enable strong economic growth and social development for generations to come.  Lifting people out of poverty, maintaining a healthy planet, promoting economic growth and development, and tearing down barriers to equality are one and the same fight. Development can only be sustainable when it is equitable and serves all people. By investing in people nowâempowering them to make choices that are good for themselves and the global commonsâour world of 7 billion can have thriving sustainable cities, productive labour forces that can fuel economic growth and youth populations that can fully contribute to their communities and nations.  Our world of 7 billion presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities. We must meet the challenges and seize the opportunities now to chart a sustainable, equitable, healthy and socially just path to the future.","['billion', 'sustainable', 'development', 'youth', 'capital', 'opportunities', 'young', 'populations', 'women', 'invest', 'education', 'world', 'human', 'economic']","Exclusive for the Daily Outlook AfghanistanOn 31 October, the world's population is projected to reach 7 billion.

Anti-Narcotics War,"Opinion: In official Government press releases, they claim opium cultivation is the main source of income for farmers in the province; therefore it needs long-term strategy to reduce  ...",Abbas Daiyar,"September 04, 2012","In official Government press releases, they claim opium cultivation is the main source of income for farmers in the province; therefore it needs long-term strategy to reduce production. Millions of dollars have been spent in alternative crop supporting programs. But recent history tells us a different story. For instance, farmers in Helmand, a.k.a Opiumistan, did not grow poppy in 70s and 80s, and under the last years of Taliban rule. If these peasants could make a livelihood through other crops, why they are unable to do so today, despite the attractive supporting-packages they are being offered in mega-million alternative-crop programs? The US, Britain and Denmark financed $13 million for the eradication campaign last year. More than 42,000 farmers in Helmand were enlisted to receive subsidized wheat and fertilizer. The peasants paid only a quarter of the market price for the supply they were provided under this subsidy program.   According to latest media reports, there is a dangerous trend of new rise in the use of drugs in Afghanistan. According to a report from Herat, an increasing number of drug users are female. Statistics show that annually there are more than 150 new addicts. Among them, there are also pregnant women, who transfer this deadly-addiction to their newborns. It is more dangerous, because children of a female addict also become addicts.   In the kingdom of Opiumistan, Governor Mengal is credited for the support-package dubbed as ""food zone program"". For the last two years, we have seen their failure to bring a big difference. The question is, how long will the international community continue financing the campaign, and the Anti-Narcotics Ministry keep 'bribing' the farmers to stop poppy cultivation? The Government has been very soft in the opium war. There are certain reasons behind this.   The answer to this question is clear. The drug business is not that simple. There is a big mafia that controls the supply and cultivation, with support from bigwigs in the corridors of power.   The official argument and statistics is that 60% to 70% of the farmers in Helmand depend on poppy production, and if there is an eradication campaign of destroying the crops, it will ""push"" the peasants to insurgency. With this logic, the poorest of Afghanistan in Badakhshan and Daikundi should have been the Opiumistan, or centers of insurgency. It is not a reduction-campaign, but a bribery-package to the so-called 'farmers'. The myth that majority of farmers grow poppy because of extreme poverty is partly a propaganda and disinformation campaign by drug-lords and those who are in this business.   The Government has no efficient program for drug addicts. There is only one hospital of 150-bed for over 70,000 drug addicts in Herat. There must be strict checking and rehabilitation centers in Herat for all the returnees. The mounting number of drug addicts across the country is just one of the problems that come with Afghan refugees, besides the spread of HIV AIDS, prostitution and social problems. With easy availability of all kinds of drugs in cheap prices, it is spreading fast in other parts of the country.   Our economy depends heavily on drug trade. While talking at an international conference recently, the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged countries involved in Afghanistan to step up the fight to combat poppy cultivation and drug business. He said there cannot be sustainable development when opium production is the only viable economic activity in Afghanistan, and added that there cannot be stability when 15 percent of our gross domestic product comes from drug trade.   The UN Secretary General said Afghanistan's drug economy is worth $2.4 billion. He emphasized that the Afghan Government must prioritize the issue of narcotics. Law enforcement agencies must work harder on eradication crops, eliminating laboratories, keeping precursors from entering the country.   According to a UN report released last year, poppy cultivation in Afghanistan has increased significantly. The report said there has been an increase of seven percent in the year 2011 compared to the year before that. The increase was reported despite the fact that Ministry of Antinarcotics had claimed to have destroyed 65 percent of the total cultivation that year.   The US and its NATO allies caught up in the prioritize of an exit strategy, are largely ignoring the focus on poppy eradication, and our Government with some bigwigs of the power corridor involved in drug profits have always been opposing effective and harsh programs of eradication.   The Government and international forces should enforce the poppy eradication campaign. The war on poppy is forgotten. Aside from the fact that a huge part of the financial support to insurgents comes from transport and smuggling of opium, it's also exporting deaths to millions of people around the world, and the number of drug addicts increasing in Afghanistan. Taliban militants get $400 million a year through direct and indirect revenue from poppy cultivation, transportation and trade.","['addicts', 'drug', 'opium', 'report', 'war', 'antinarcotics', 'afghanistan', 'farmers', 'campaign', 'eradication', 'poppy', 'cultivation']","The US, Britain and Denmark financed $13 million for the eradication campaign last year.

International Womenâs Day,"Opinion: Hillary  Clinton states very nicely, There cannot be true democracy  unless womens voices are heard. There cannot be true democracy unless women  are given the opportunity to take ...",Hujjatullah Zia,"March 08, 2014","As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of, the day.   A million darkened kitchens, a thousand mill lofts gray.   Are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses,   For the people hear us singing, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses.  As we come marching, marching, we bring the greater days.  The rising of the women means the rising of the race.   No more the drudge and idler that toil where one reposes.  But a sharing of life's glories, Bread and Roses, Bread and Roses.Hillary  Clinton states very nicely, “There cannot be true democracy  unless women’s voices are heard. There cannot be true democracy unless women  are given the opportunity to take responsibility for their own lives. There  cannot be true democracy unless all citizens are able to participate fully in  the lives of their country.” She adds, “Human rights are women’s rights, and  women’s rights are human rights. Let us not forget that among those rights are  the right to speak freely â and the right to be heard.”In 18th century, when women were brought to industrial  companies in America and Europe, they suffered seriously from laboring long  hours in return for low income. In other words, their employers exploited them to  such an extent that they felt compelled to raise their voice against their  injustice. Their protest was the first spark which bore fruit in 19th  century. On March 8, 1857, garment workers in New York City marched and  picketed, demanding improved working conditions, a ten hour day, and equal  rights for women. Their ranks were broken up by the police. Fifty-one years  later, March 8, 1908, their sisters in the needle trades in New York marched  again, honoring the 1857 march, demanding the vote, and an end to sweatshops  and child labor. On February 28, 1909, the first National Woman’s Day was observed  in the US. The US Socialist Party designated this in honor of the 1908 garment  workers’ strike in New York. In 1910, the Socialist International, meeting in Copenhagen,  established a Women’s Day, to honor the movement for women’s rights and to  build support for achieving universal suffrage for women. The proposal was  greeted with unanimous approval by the conference of over 100 women from 17  countries, which included the first three women elected to the Finnish  Parliament. No fixed date was selected for the observance. In 1911, as a result of the Copenhagen initiative, International  Women’s Day was marked for the first time, in 19th March, in  Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland, where more than one million women  and men attended rallies. In addition to the right to vote and to hold public  office, they demanded women’s rights to work, to vocational training and to an  end to discrimination on the job. This view that women are somehow  inferior to men is not restricted to one culture or belief. It is widespread.  Women are prevented from playing a full and equal role in many societies.  Moreover, women suffer many challenges such as gender bias, violence, sexual  harassment, and etc. all around the world. At their most repugnant, the belief  that women must be subjugated to the wishes of men excuses slavery, violence,  forced prostitution, genital mutilation and national laws that omit rape as a  crime. But it also costs many millions of girls and women control over their  own bodies and lives, and continues to deny them fair access to education,  health, employment and influence within their own communities. The impact of these patriarchal  beliefs touches every aspect of our lives. They help explain why in many  countries boys are educated before girls; why girls are told when and whom they  must marry; and why many face enormous and unacceptable risks in pregnancy and  childbirth because their basic health needs are not met.It is not women and girls alone who  suffer. It damages all of us. The evidence shows that investing in women and  girls delivers major benefits for everyone in society. An educated woman has  healthier children. She is more likely to send them to school. She earns more  and invests what she earns in her family.Ill-fatedly, women suffer from  social and domestic violence in our society to a large extent. They fall victim  to men’s cruelties in one way or another. For instance, in the current solar  year, Afghan women underwent highly tragic incident. They were flogged and  stoned in desert court, stabbed and shot to death, killed by axe, raped and a  woman’s nose and lips were lopped off. In addition, numerous Afghan women  committed to working for peace and development have been murdered, including  four policewomen, a local government worker and a pregnant school teacher. The Afghanistan  Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) announced on November 25th,  which was the International Day for Elimination of Violence Against Women, that  a 25 percent jump in reported cases of human rights violations against women in  Afghanistan in 2013. The AIHRC released a report on the same day, which stated  that 4, 154 cases of human rights violations had been filed by Afghan women in  only six months of the current solar year. The AIHRC added that violations  against women can include psychological, physical, sexual, economic and verbal  mistreatment.I would like to conclude my article  with Nelson Mandela’s statement as he says, “As long as we take the view that  these are problems for women alone to solve, we cannot expect to reverse the  high incidence of rape and child abuse. Domestic violence will not be  eradicated. We will not defeat this scourge that affects each and every one of  us, until we succeed in mobilizing the whole of our society to fight it.” He adds,  “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every  woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity  and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a  lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our  women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.”","['girls', 'day', 'marching', 'men', 'woman', 'womens', 'violence', 'women', 'international', 'rights', 'human']","As we come marching, marching, in the beauty of, the day.
As we come marching, marching, we bring the greater days.
There cannot be true democracy unless all citizens are able to participate fully in the lives of their country.” She adds, “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights.

Moscow Hopes its Afghan  Rebuild to Usher in Stability,"News: KABUL - Russia hopes to embark on a series of ambitious construction projects in Afghanistan aimed at reinforcing fragile stability in the country where Soviet troops fought a disastrous, decade-long war, its envoy to Kabul said Thursday.<br>   Though not connected by land, Moscow sees war-ravaged Afghanistan as  ...",Daily Outlook Afghanistan,"Febraury 18, 2012","KABUL - Russia hopes to embark on a series of ambitious construction projects in Afghanistan aimed at reinforcing fragile stability in the country where Soviet troops fought a disastrous, decade-long war, its envoy to Kabul said Thursday.  Though not connected by land, Moscow sees war-ravaged Afghanistan as a neighbor and is concerned by what it describes as the two-pronged threat of drugs and terrorism which reach Russia through ex-Soviet Central Asian countries.  Andrey Avetisyan said Russia had limited involvement in Afghan reconstruction over the last decade ""because it was all about fighting, and since we are not fighting, we didn't see much place for our activity.""  But that approach has changed. ""Now, we're trying to kind of start anew,"" he told Reuters in the glistening rebuilt embassy, a third of its Soviet size during the war, whose end 23 years ago Wednesday was marked by Afghans and Russians.  Russia hopes to begin with reconstructing around 150 Soviet-era projects, from Afghanistan's most important stretch of highway, the congested and aging Salang tunnel, to a Kabul bread factory that once fed the entire Afghan security forces.  For these, many of which were built by Soviets before they invaded in 1979, the same technology, documentation and even the same engineers still exist, meaning the Russians are in prime position to take over the work, Avetisyan said.  Moscow then aims to delve into new ventures, involving oil extraction, hydroelectric projects, housing and possibly even build the country's first railway network.  The Asian Development Bank a year ago estimated Afghanistan's infrastructure requirements at more than $4 billion.  Avetisyan declined to put a price tag on the Russian projects, but said a meeting in two weeks in Moscow, with Afghan Finance Minister Omar Zakhilwal, should shed more light on the exact proposals and what will be agreed upon.  Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom, oil major Rosneft, state railway firm Russian Railways, second-biggest oil producer LUKOIL and state power holding company Inter RAO, as well as others, were interested in concrete projects in Afghanistan, he said.""We're not going to tell the Afghans how to live, which life to live -- we stopped doing this 25 years ago,"" said Avetisyan, who worked for the Soviet government in Kabul, becoming fluent in Afghanistan's two main languages, Dari and Pashto.""We just want to have a friendly, independent Afghanistan as our neighbor... Economic development should go first, because there cannot be security without (this). The roots of insecurity are in the problems for people to find jobs, have a home.""""PAST TEN YEARS ALMOST WASTED""  Escalating violence across Afghanistan in the 11th year of an increasingly unpopular war has sent tremors of worry across Russia, which borders mainly Muslim former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and which is battling a growing Islamist insurgency in its own volatile North Caucasus.  The flow of Afghan heroin, branded a threat to national security by the Kremlin, has also set off alarm bells in a country which health officials warn is the world's top user of heroin, spurring a crippling HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Underscoring those fears is the looming deadline of end-2014 for NATO to train a 350,000-strong force of Afghan police and soldiers who will take over all security responsibilities from foreign combat troops, who will also leave by that time.  Avetisyan said Washington was at risk of repeating the errant ways of its Cold War foe in approaching Afghanistan. ""They (the U.S.) came 10 years ago, thought they could fix it very quickly, and then leave. Exactly the same mistake that the Soviet army made,"" he said of its dispirited 1989 exit from a war that took 15,000 Soviet lives.  After the Soviets rushed out, the Afghan communist government collapsed, leading to infighting between warlords and a vicious civil war that reduced much of Kabul to rubble and paved the way for the Taliban's rise to power in 1996.  Avetisyan lamented the slow economic development over the last decade, echoing the discontent of many ordinary Afghans who accuse the U.S. force in their country of not building enough.  ""The past ten years were almost wasted in this sense,"" he said.""... Why have the Americans achieved so little in terms of economic development? Because it is not in their plans and it still is not, I am afraid.""

Proficient Public Administration;  Vital for Good Governance!,"Opinion: Afghanistan has been ravaged by years of conflict. 	Afghan national institutions are severely factional and lack a cohesive national security culture.  In other words, Afghan institutions are  ...",Asmat Yari,"January 08, 2013","Afghanistan has been ravaged by years of conflict. 	Afghan national institutions are severelyÂ factionalÂ and lack a cohesive national security culture.Â  In other words, Afghan institutions are not sufficiently focused on defending their own national interests. Influential Afghan figures continue to promote patronage networks further institutionalizing favoritism andÂ corruption. The Afghan government continues to give free rein to well-known warlords and human rights abusers as well as corrupt politicians and businesspeople, further eroding public support. Reconstruction of the economic and political institutions through better administrative reforms is perhaps the most important means to ensuring long-term success of a state.   Without a well-functioning government apparatus, administrative system and an efficient and productive economy, no state will be able to maintain basic state functions. The objective is to strengthen planning and auditing activities, promote quality assurance, implement public welfare policies, organize management of human resources, maintain ongoing efforts to reform the administration and fight against corruption, and lay the foundations for managing finances and procurement. These broad based objectives can be met by inventing an efficient administrative system that could relief Afghanistan out of lingering administrative problems.  In that pursuit a democratic institution must be built on structures and processes that are accountable, transparent, decentralized, and able to manage legitimate elections and the administration of justice, and operate under the oversight of the parliament. Furthermore, it should combat exclusion, protect public goods, actively engage civil society and the private sector, promote participation, and strengthen partnerships among sectors, groups, and every levels of government. Revitalizing public administration for people-centered development would require reform efforts that incorporate these characteristics.  Effective and efficient administrative system, including public sector management, promotes and strengthens democracy and good governance. An effectively functioning civil service is essential in order to ensure that democratically elected leaders are able to protect the rights of citizens and mobilize resources through taxes and other sources in order to pay for police, judges, and the provision of services.  A consolidated democracy requires administrative capacity of the state to maintain law and order, and to promote and protect public goods such as environment.  Public confidence in the political system and subsequently the political legitimacy of the government â is increased where the public service delivery system is effective, where the public officials are accessible to local citizens, and where government agencies and departments work together in well coordinated, complementary ways. Equally important is the capacity to govern, to make important policy choices, design and implement programs and actions to achieve policy objectives, and anticipate emerging trends and challenges. Public sector management capacity to perform the above and related tasks, however, requires merit based recruitment of qualified personnel, effective human resource development strategies, motivation and commitment of civil servants, and transparent processes for policy formulation, budgeting, and implementation.   Over the period past 50 years, the concept of public administration has gone through four phases ranging from public administration to governance. First being public administration that was historically perceived to be a set of state structures, institutions, and processes. It was characterized, among others, by hierarchy, continuity, impartiality, standardization, legal-rational authority, and professionalism. Among others, it was expected to provide human security and protection of property, establish and enforce societal standards, and sustain the rule of law.  Yet, in practice, traditional public administration is severely criticized for red-tape, slowness, paternalism vis-Ã -vis citizens, waste of resources, and too much focus on process and procedures instead of results, which is currently experienced in this landscape.   The second phase being public management, focused on the application of management principles including efficiency in utilization of resources, effectiveness, customer orientation, reliance on market forces, and greater sensitivity to public needs. It called for expanding the role of the private sector and correspondingly, minimizing the size of the public sector and the domain of traditional public administration. It sought to use private sector principles in public sector organizations.                                                                                       The third phase, is New Public Management (NPM), continued the previous trends. It focused on outcome-oriented partnerships between the public and the private sector to provide services to citizens. Its main principles were: Firstly, flexibility for the managers to cope with on-going changes in the national and global environment i.e. steering rather than rowing; Secondly, empowerment of citizens to promote more efficient, entrepreneurial, and resultsâoriented management; Thirdly, new responsibility mechanisms that go beyond compliance mechanisms to search for innovations and results over process; Fourthly, introducing business principles into public affairs including out-sourcing and contracting out; Fifthly, promoting professional ethics in the public sphere; and sixthly, performance management and budgeting as stated by UN.  The fourth phase is the governance that has been defined as a system of values, policies, and institutions by which a society manages its economic, social, and political affairs through interactions within and among the state, civil society and private sector. It comprises the mechanisms and processes for citizens and groups to articulate their interests, mediate their differences, and exercise their legal rights and obligations. It is the rules, institutions, and practices that set limits and provide incentives for individuals, organizations and firms, according to UNDP 2000.   There are three actors involved in governance: the State, which creates a conducive political and legal environment; the private sector, which generates jobs and income; and civil society, which facilitates social and political interaction. The essence of governance is to foster interaction between these three types of actors to promote people-centered development. Although governance is one fabric, for the sake of analysis and entry points for action, it can be divided into three dimensions.  Political governance means the range of processes through which a society reaches consensus and implements regulations, human rights, laws, and policies. Economic governance is the architecture for national and international economic activities, including processes to manage the production of goods and services and to organize and protect natural, fiscal, and human resources. Social governance is the set of norms, values, and beliefs that guide society decisions and behaviors. Each dimension of governance affects and interacts with the other two dimensions.   Good governance, the prime pre-requisite of Afghanistan, refers to the question of how a society can organize itself to ensure equality of opportunity and equity (social and economic justice) for all citizens. Good governance is a value in itself, but it is also the most critical means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals â the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the achievement of universal primary education, the promotion of gender equality, the reduction of child mortality, the improvement of maternal health, the fight against HIV/AIDS, polio and other diseases, and the promotion of environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development. Without a proficient system of public administration engraved in this piece of land the dream of good governance can't be crystallized.","['society', 'promote', 'proficient', 'system', 'good', 'governance', 'administration', 'sector', 'state', 'public', 'management', 'political', 'vital']","Revitalizing public administration for people-centered development would require reform efforts that incorporate these characteristics.

Democracy Enshrines Equality of Opportunity!,"Opinion: the ultimate goal of  democracy is to preserve and promote the dignity and fundamental rights of the  individual, to achieve social justice, foster the economic and social  development of ...",Asmatyari,"June 10, 2015","the ultimate goal of  democracy is to preserve and promote the dignity and fundamental rights of the  individual, to achieve social justice, foster the economic and social  development of the community, strengthen the cohesion of society and build a  favorable environment for international peace. Democracy, development and human  rights are therefore interdependent. The government has been poor enough to  ensure all such provisions of democratic system.Afghanistan has been  ravaged by years of conflict. Subsequent to Talibanâs regime toppled,  Afghanistan was put on the way to democracy, the established and wide practiced  system of government. Afghan national institutions are severely factional and  lack a cohesive national security culture.Â   In other words, Afghan institutions are not sufficiently focused on  defending their own national interests. Influential figures continue to promote  patronage networks further institutionalizing favoritism and corruption. The  Afghan government continues to give free rein to well-known warlords and human  rights abusers as well as corrupt politicians and businesspeople, further  eroding public support. Reconstruction of the economic and political  institutions through better administrative reforms is perhaps the most  important means to ensuring long-term success of a state. The September 11  tragic incidence turned a blessing in disguise for Afghanis that brought  Talibanâs repressive and despotic rule to an end. Subsequently, the modes of  government altered but not the fate of people. The installment of democracy  devoid of its fundamental requisites left the people suffer at the hand of  non-conforming elements, insurgents and terrorists who at present seems to have  grown mightier than previous. The centralized government brought forth, is  perceived as continuation of denied political rights. The completion of two  democratic terms and slight betterment in women rights and a small degree of  freedom, of course, count the successes of the democratic government. The most  crucial aspect that left undermined or ignored must be given prime importance  in order to ensure vibrant democracy, as underlined below.Â Â Â  It ascertains,  peopleâs participation to play an active role in political and civic life. One  expresses his will through regular free and fair elections. Voting in a  democracy must be universal, equal and secret so that each of us can choose our  representatives freely which is not witnessed in Afghanistan till date.  Education and vibrant communications media are vital to be able to make an informed  choice. Literacy rate touches the ground and media is highly restraint. The  role citizens end after they cast their ballots; they arenât continually  engaged in public affairs so that thus kept ignorant of their right and duties. The Afghan population  currently has few means of expressing dissent regarding policies carried out by  the international community and the central government, which operates on a  highly centralized patronage model in which power and resources are channeled  through personal and political allies. The system lacks the connection, rules,  and checks and balances necessary to make leaders truly accountable to the  domestic population, which invites corruption, rent-seeking, and a hemorrhaging  of domestic legitimacy. Local governmental bodies are the appropriate places  for representing Afghans and responding to their needs, but these currently  suffer from a lack of capacity, confusion over their roles and authorities, and  little legitimacy.Incorporating the  promotion of equality and dignity through the system of equal value for the  vote of all individuals regardless of their sex, religion, language, economic  or social status in democracy ensures political justice which is the foundation  of social and economic justice, dignity of the individual and national  cohesion.Without a  well-functioning government apparatus, administrative system and an efficient  and productive economy, no state will be able to maintain basic state  functions. The objective is to strengthen planning and auditing activities,  promote quality assurance, implement public welfare policies, organize  management of human resources, maintain ongoing efforts to reform the  administration and fight against corruption, and lay the foundations for  managing finances and procurement. These broad based objectives can be met by  inventing an efficient administrative system that could relief Afghanistan out  of lingering administrative problems.In that pursuit a  democratic institution must be built on structures and processes that are  accountable, transparent, decentralized, and able to manage legitimate  elections and the administration of justice, and operate under the oversight of  the parliament. Furthermore, it should combat exclusion, protect public goods,  actively engage civil society and the private sector, promote participation,  and strengthen partnerships among sectors, groups, and every levels of  government. Revitalizing public administration for people-centered development  would require reform efforts that incorporate these characteristics.Effective and  efficient administrative system, including public sector management, promotes  and strengthens democracy and good governance. An effectively functioning civil  service is essential in order to ensure that democratically elected leaders are  able to protect the rights of citizens and mobilize resources through taxes and  other sources in order to pay for police, judges, and the provision of  services. A consolidated democracy requires administrative capacity of the  state to maintain law and order, and to promote and protect public goods such  as environment. Public sector management capacity to perform the above and  related tasks, however, requires merit based recruitment of qualified  personnel, effective human resource development strategies, motivation and  commitment of civil servants, and transparent processes for policy formulation,  budgeting, and implementation.Â Â Â Â Â  Good governance, the  prime pre-requisite of Afghanistan, refers to the question of how a society can  organize itself to ensure equality of opportunity and equity (social and  economic justice) for all citizens. Good governance is a value in itself, but  it is also the most critical means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  (MDG)â the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, the achievement of  universal primary education, the promotion of gender equality, the reduction of  child mortality, the improvement of maternal health, the fight against  HIV/AIDS, polio and other diseases, and the promotion of environmental sustainability  and a global partnership for development. The government established on sound  grounds of protection and promotion of right of every individual, is liable to  achieve the heart and soul of masses and universal development goal alike âsuch  act of governing is in fact in accordance to sprite of democracy.","['administrative', 'enshrines', 'promote', 'equality', 'development', 'system', 'democracy', 'justice', 'social', 'public', 'opportunity', 'rights', 'political']","Democracy, development and human rights are therefore interdependent.

Addiction;  a Catastrophe,Opinion: A  very critical and hazardous obstacle along with the Afghan security and  political development is the challenging matter that is for sure the drug  planting and growing in an eye catching ...,Zainab Ahmadi,"June 06, 2013","A  very critical and hazardous obstacle along with the Afghan security and  political development is the challenging matter that is for sure the drug  planting and growing in an eye catching ratio. A survey shows that nearly 90%  of the world narcotic is grown in our homeland Afghanistan. This has not only  been a domestic catastrophe for the Afghan civilian but for the globe too. The  ministry of social health care centers announced that nearly 2.5 million of  Afghan civilians are addicted to intoxicating stuffs such as opium, hashish,  chars and many other harmful drugs. The annual export of opium from Afghanistan  is astonishing whilst the government cannot really take any sort of serious actions  against the high growth of drug addiction in Afghan civilians. In particular  the young and fresh stratum of our community has been vulnerable through  decades concerning drug addiction. It is not only the male gender who suffers  from this pernicious disease but recently the female gender has also been  involved in such activities. The point to ponder about is there are not any  specialized care centers to treat and cure the addicted people.What  is drug addiction and what harms and side effects it causes for the health of  addicted people?Drug  addiction is a dependence on an illegal drug or medication. When you are  addicted, you may not be able to control your drug use and you may continue  using the drug despite the harm it causes. Drug addiction can cause an intense  craving for the drug. You may want to quit, but most people find that they  cannot do it on their own. For many people, what starts as casual use leads to  drug addiction. Drug addiction can cause serious, long term consequences,  including problems with physical and mental health, relationship, employment  and the law. Drug addiction is a complex brain disease. It is characterized by  compulsive, at times uncontrollable, drug craving, seeking, and uses that persist  even in the face of extremely negative consequences. Drug seeking becomes  compulsive, in large part as a result of the effects of prolonged drug use on  brain functioning and, thus, on behavior. For many people, drug addiction  becomes chronic, with relapses possible even after long period of abstinence.Many  people do not understand why and how other people become addicted to drug. It  is often mistakenly assumed that drug abusers lack moral principles or will power  and that they can stop using drugs simply by choosing to change their behavior.  In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease. And quitting takes more than  good and firm intention or a strong will. In fact, because drug change the  brain in ways that foster compulsive drug abuse. Quitting is difficult even for  those who really want to do so. Through scientific advances, we know more about  how drug works in the brain than ever, and we also know that drug addiction can  be successful to help people stop abusing drugs and lead productive lives. Opium has been cultivated in Afghanistan  since 1100 A.D., although production has steadily increased since 1979.  Currently, Afghanistan produces three-quarters of the global opium supply, with  injection drug use and HIV currently following the opium trade route through  Central Asia. Although systematic studies are lacking, heroin use appears to be  on the rise in Afghanistan. The purpose of this article is to briefly provide  historical background and current statistics for drug production and use in  Afghanistan, to discuss the new government's policies towards problem drug use  and available rehabilitation programs, and to assess Afghan harm reduction  needs with consideration of regional trends.The rise of the Taliban regime was marked with  steady increasing opium production, despite their pledge to ""cleanse  Afghanistan of the poisoned poppies. Increased opium production has been  attributed to economic realities faced by the Taliban, who received little  external donor support due to international sanctions. Historically, opium has  been used in Afghan communities as medication for different conditions,  particularly pain and respiratory complaints.  Opium use also has a traditional role  in the societies of some groups. There  are few national estimates of opium use in Afghanistan; the highest regional  use is noted in northeastern Badakhshan Province along the Tajik border, with  20â30% of the local population estimated to be addicted. High use rates have  also been reported in districts of Herat and Farah Provinces. Although problem of drug use appears  to be increasing in Afghanistan, addiction treatment remains limited. Medical  services are provided to addicts through both public and private sectors,  which, together, are not able to meet the demand for services. In the public  sector, the National Mental Health Institutes, under direction of the Ministry  of Public Health (MoPH), have functioning treatment and rehabilitation centers  in several Afghan cities. The center in Kabul (Mental Health Institute) has  only 30 treatment slots. In a few provinces, there are branches of the Mental  Health Institute providing out-patient services, such as counseling, but these  do not have an in-patient facility.Addiction has been a real problem for our society  in particular in the capital Kabul if we put a glimpse over the environment of  the capital there are thousands of problems from the pollution to addiction.  Thousands of our youngsters are involved in such activities which are deadly  dangerous for the future of our community. There is a dire need of changes in  the policy of social challenges for the concerned government. Letâs make this  our social, cultural, religious and humanitarian duty that each individual of  us would feel his responsibility and act upon those responsibilities in the  best way. We would urge from our youngsters to severely avoid using drugs  either narcotics or tobaccos because everything gradually increases; people  start from cigarette and consequently reach to heroin, opium, chars and other  compulsive and irritating stuffs. It is thought that in a society where the  young generation does not feel its duties and put the bucks on the other strata  of the societyâs shoulder that society is condemned to the harsh and dire  penalties, however there is a bright flashes of hope in the fortune of our  community if we shake our legs and feel the pain and sweat out our efforts to  gain achievements and make our society free of every junks and punks.Â","['drug', 'health', 'opium', 'afghan', 'production', 'afghanistan', 'daily', 'mental', 'addiction', 'outlook', 'society', 'addicted']","In particular the young and fresh stratum of our community has been vulnerable through decades concerning drug addiction.

A Tangible Change,"Opinion: It is not necessary that everyone should open a school, you can take 2-3 children of poor families to a school and bear their expenses or you can go to a good school and inform the school ...",Mohammad Rasool Shah,"July 04, 2013","I was travelling by the public coaster and it was passing  through the slums of the city. Everything was saddening. There were children  crying in the streets. Majority of these children were bare-footed and  bare-headed and shivered in the cold winds of winter. The mere look of these  children could either arouse disgust or pity, but nothing pleasant. There were youngsters  with dim and frustrated faces, lacking the light of youth in their eyes. Majority of them appeared to have come from work, which was  apparent from their mud-filled hair and torn skins. There were old men who  seemed to be struggling to sustain their lives. There were men who looked very  exhausted to make the ends meet. I also witnessed a woman shouting with a  shopkeeper. I am sure her money had fallen short, as always, and would be  trying to make the best of the bargain in this regard. This is not limited to  the people only. Dark and small houses, stinking and dirty streets, and other  limited facilities make the life even more difficult and dull. Similarly,  children could have been noticed bringing water from far places. Electricity  and other civic facilities are only a dream for them.Then let’s go to another part of the city. As you enter the  area, you immediately develop a pleasant feeling. There are big houses which  are spread on a large area. Every house has a large garden or a lawn where you  can see children playing happily, and they appear as if angels have landed who  are cherishing the innocent and pure joys of life. These children are wearing  the most beautiful imported clothes which have further enhanced their innocent  beauty. At times, we see an old man or lady who appears to be healthy,  contented and having a strange haughtiness in his or her style. Everything  attached with this community shouts loudly that they are the chosen ones.  Latest and shining cars, beautifully decorated rooms, clean and silent streets,  covered by green trees on both the sides of the road, and every single facility  has been improvised with every minute detail. Both of the above scenarios can have absolutely opposite  impacts on the people. For a person who is struggling hard to keep himself or  the family alive, the best recreation is to have food enough to fill up his belly  or feed his family. With such a background, almost everyone is caught in the  fear of economic failure and thus everyone tries to make some addition to the  income of the family. There are men who walk to work and when they return home,  they are absolutely tired and disappointed, as their meager income never meets  their expenses. Once I was studying the behavior of workers while drinking  tea in breaks and it surprised me how they can long such avariciously for a  single cup of tea. Such a desire and feeling is very difficult to be understood  unless a person gets into the same situation and feels the taste of a cup of  hot tea which is offered to you when you are hungry and working in cold for a  number of hours. While sitting in a hot and pleasant room, adequately supplied  with fruits and drinks, we can never understand this philosophy. Here, the biggest loss is the loss of being dignified and  respectable. As you loiter here and there without much attention and importance,  slowly and gradually you develop a feeling that you are of no use to anyone and  thus you lose your credibility in your own eyes. In short, moments of joy and recreation are very less and  every difficulty lands on them to be very severe. Aids or HIV is not a disease  itself. It makes your immunity system very weak and thus your body cannot fight  or overcome diseases and thus any small illness like flu or cold becomes fatal  and doesn’t leave your body. You might have noticed members of a very poor  family fighting or shouting on petty issues that seem to be very less important  to us like buying a pair of shoes to the children but if one doesn’t have  enough money to buy bread, can hardly make any such expense. On the other hand, let’s have a look at the behavior or the  situation of the rich. First, they are very much busy in carrying out their  businesses or jobs and sometimes don’t find time to their family members but  when they get free, they have their own attachments and interests. Elders are  mostly found busy in buying new cars, houses or attending social gatherings  where they sit with the people of their own kind. Youngsters are busy in buying  new gadgets and looking for opportunities to pass their times in a variety of  interesting ways. Older members of this group enjoy the comfort that has been  supplied with the wealth of the family and make sure that this set up of prosperity  should exist and continue.At times, their conscience is shaken by the miseries of  people around them but they have a proven weapon to repel this attack by  saying, ‘These are the lazy people. Nobody gifted me this prosperity and I  earned it by my hard work, luck and better thinking strategy. If they cannot  think better or their luck is not clicking, then how can I help?’Some of them try to silent this inner voice by giving out  some money to poor or doing other similar temporary works of charity and thus  they free themselves from the court of their conscience.Some of them even say this, ‘I am happy and have a good life  and I haven’t created any problem to anyone and have not harmed anyone, then  why I should I blame myself for this?’But it is said that if there is fire at one corner of the city  and you are not taking any kind of responsibility to control, it would  definitely reach to your house as well and turn it into ashes. French revolution is one of the most bloody and tragic  examples of such a situation when the gap between the poor and the rich reached  to an extent that only the blood of sacrifice could fill up the space. Rich  were having pleasant and wonderful lives while poor were only struggling to  keep their existence. When poor saw that the scenario was not going to change  and rich were fully drunk in their luxuries, they rose and then set each and  everything of rich into fire. They killed thousands of rich and did not spare  even their children or families. It thus becomes the responsibility of rich to do something  permanent to bring equilibrium in the society. It doesn’t mean that they should  give easy money to the poor and develop the habit of laziness in them. There is  a Chinese saying that, ‘Don’t give me the fish, rather teach me how to fish’.  In the same way, we can take steps that can bring permanent and positive  changes in the lives of poor. Very easy way is to establish schools where  deserving poor children should be given free education. This experiment has  successfully been done in Turkey which has changed the fate of the nation. It  is not necessary that everyone should open a school, you can take 2-3 children  of poor families to a school and bear their expenses or you can go to a good  school and inform the school administration to support 2-3 poor students and  they would easily make the rest of the arrangements. Educating 2-3 students is  not so difficult but if every one of us starts this work, this would definitely  bring a great change in the society. Otherwise, I fear that we can also face an  Afghan revolution which might be bloodier than the French revolution.","['times', 'pleasant', 'work', 'school', 'children', 'family', 'change', 'tangible', 'tea', 'rich', 'poor', 'money']","Majority of them appeared to have come from work, which was apparent from their mud-filled hair and torn skins.

The risks were health threats, sexual violence, non-sexual violence,  cultural or religious factors, lack of access to resources and trafficking.  Some experts said the poll showed that subtle  dangers such as discrimination that don't grab headlines are sometimes just as  significant risks for women as bombs, bullets, stoning and systematic rape in  conflict zones.  ""I think you have to look at all the  dangers to women, all the risks women and girls face,"" said Elisabeth  Roesch, who works on gender-based violence for the International Rescue  Committee in Washington.  ""If a woman can't access healthcare  because her healthcare isn't prioritised, that can be a very dangerous  situation as well.""  LITANY OF PERILS  Afghanistan emerged as the most dangerous  country for women overall and worst in three of the six risk categories:  health, non-sexual violence and lack of access to economic resources.  Respondents cited sky-high maternal mortality  rates, limited access to doctors and a near total lack of economic rights.  Afghan women have a one in 11 chance of dying in childbirth, according to  UNICEF.  Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), still  reeling from a 1998-2003 war and accompanying humanitarian disaster that killed  5.4 million people, came second mainly due to staggering levels of sexual  violence in the lawless east.  More than 400,000 women are raped in the  country each year, according to a recent study by U.S. researchers. The United  Nations has called Congo the rape capital of the world.  ""Statistics from DRC are very revealing on  this: ongoing war, use of rape as a weapon, recruitment of females as soldiers  who are also used as sex slaves,"" said Clementina Cantoni, a  Pakistan-based aid worker with ECHO, the European Commission's humanitarian aid  department.  ""The fact that the government is corrupt  and that female rights are very low on the agenda means that there is little or  no recourse to justice.""  Rights activists say militia groups and  soldiers target all ages, including girls as young as three and elderly women.  They are gang-raped, raped with bayonets and have guns shot into their vaginas.  Pakistan ranked third largely on the basis of  cultural, tribal and religious practices harmful to women. These include acid  attacks, child and forced marriage and punishment or retribution by stoning or  other physical abuse.""Pakistan has some of the highest rates of  dowry murder, so-called honor killings and early marriage,"" said Divya  Bajpai, reproductive health advisor at the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.  Some 1,000 women and girls die in honor  killings annually, according to Pakistan's Human Rights Commission.  TRAFFICKING  India ranked fourth primarily due to female  feticide, infanticide and human trafficking.  In 2009, India's then-Home Secretary Madhukar  Gupta estimated that 100 million people, mostly women and girls, were involved  in trafficking in India that year.  ""The practice is common but lucrative so  it goes untouched by government and police,"" said Cristi Hegranes, founder  of the Global Press institute, which trains women in developing countries to be  journalists.  India's Central Bureau of Investigation  estimated that in 2009 about 90 percent of trafficking took place within the  country and that there were some 3 million prostitutes, of which about 40  percent were children.  In addition to sex slavery, other forms of  trafficking include forced labor and forced marriage, according to a U.S. State  Department report on trafficking in 2010. The report also found slow progress  in criminal prosecutions of traffickers.  Up to 50 million girls are thought to be  ""missing"" over the past century due to female infanticide and  foeticide, the U.N. Population Fund says.  Some experts said the world's largest democracy  was relatively forthcoming about describing its problems, possibly casting it  in a darker light than if other countries were equally transparent about  trafficking.  Somalia ranked fifth due to a catalogue of  dangers including high maternal mortality, rape and female genital mutilation,  along with limited access to education, healthcare and economic resources.  ""I'm completely surprised because I  thought Somalia would be first on the list, not fifth,"" Somali women's  minister Maryan Qasim told TrustLaw.  ""The most dangerous thing a woman in  Somalia can do is to become pregnant. When a woman becomes pregnant her life is  50-50 because there is no antenatal care at all. There are no hospitals, no  healthcare, no nothing.""Add to that the rape cases that happen on  a daily basis, the female genital mutilation that is being done to every single  girl in Somalia. Add to that the famine and the drought. Add to that the  fighting (which means) you can die any minute, any day.""  Poll respondents included aid professionals,  academics, health workers, policymakers, journalists and development  specialists.

Afghanistan: The Most Dangerous Place to Live,Opinion: Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to  live a healthy life. Due to poor quality health care services the wealthier  choose to seek care in other countries but the poorer have to...,Mohammad Zahir Akbari,"October 23, 2016","Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to  live a healthy life. Due to poor quality health care services the wealthier  choose to seek care in other countries but the poorer have to frequently die  and suffer. According to reports, in Kabul one in five had travelled outside  Afghanistan to seek the care they required, most of them heading to neighboring  countries; While border provinces almost one in ten and one in twelve had gone  abroad to seek treatment for an illness of someone in their household. The long  distances people must travel to seek care not only delay the provision of  urgently needed treatment, but also force them to undergo perilous and costly  journeys. Nevertheless, there have been some achievements  in past 15 years but it is not sufficient because one third of entire  population still lack access to very basic healthcare services while others go  abroad due to low quality services.   Beside war, insecurity and long distances, high costs are also an  important barrier to access healthcare for many people in Afghanistan;  travelling to distant, better health facilities often increase expenses,  forcing families to become indebted to provide treatment for relatives. These  include non-medical costs for transport to and from the health facility,  accommodation and food, in addition to the actual medical costs. Despite the  fact that healthcare should be free of charge, as promised under the national free  care policy (article 52 of the national constitution) this is not the case in  many public facilities. Instead, people must pay for drugs, doctor’s fees,  laboratory tests and in-patient care. Overall, households in Afghanistan spent  on average more than 9,000 Afghani on healthcare (around 150 USD). It is  notable that urban households had a significantly higher level of expenditure  than rural households, which is likely related to lower urban poverty levels  and better access to health services. In a country where, according to the  World Bank, more than one third of the people are living below the national  poverty line of less than $1.25 USD per day, such expenditures can be  crippling. People always complain about the poor quality of the public health  system, including of staff and services; lack of appropriate drugs; and an  improperly functioning referral system. It seems that public system is obsolete;  patients often had to wait for a long time to be treated. For instance, in  clinics those are open only in the mornings, women experiencing complications  during labour at night or other times of the day or wounded patients who need  immediate medical care are not cared for in time.  Corruptions such as Informal fees, low quality or smuggled medicine  and are another worrying problems, considering that costs pose an important  barrier to access healthcare. People often have to pay bribes in order to be  seen by a doctor in a public clinic. Others spoke of doctors in public clinics  pushing people to their after-hour private practice, saying that it was better  equipped. People also regularly complained that public clinics in remote areas  sold their drug supplies to pharmacies, so that patients had to buy them  instead of receiving them free in the clinic. The importation of poor quality  medicine is another serious issue. It is said that about 90% of Afghanistan’s  pharmaceutical products are imported while 50% of them are illegally imported. As  a result, the quality of public services is often perceived to be low, even if  this is not always the case. For instance, assessment of the public clinics in  certain provinces district showed that general primary healthcare provision appeared  to be functioning well. At the time of the visits, all public health centres  are open and providing consultations free of charge and seemed to have adequate  levels of patient attendance. But distrust in the public health system causes  many people to prefer private clinics and private doctors, who are perceived to  be better in terms of quality. Yet, the quality in private system is not  necessarily justified; many complain of overprescribing, misdiagnosing and even  malpractice and medical mistakes by private practitioners. They also try  benefit from the bad reputation of the public sector and ask high fees for  their services.   More than half of Afghan girls and boys suffer damage to their  minds and bodies that cannot be undone because they are poorly nourished in the  crucial first two years of life. High levels of Malnutrition in Children is  rate of stunting is around 60%, underweight rate is around 40%, Anemia rate is  around 50% in children, High iodine deficiency: 72%(school age) and also the  high levels of Malnutrition in Women is Iron deficiency: 48.4%, non-pregnant  and Iodine deficiency 75% and high levels of chronic energy deficiency are  20.9% low BMI. There are about two million addicts in the country while the  numbers are increasing due to lack of serious fight against opium products. Likewise,  the figure of communicable disease especially HIV/AIDS are in  increase because of boost in number of drug users, the number of injuries and  disabled rising due to security condition in the country, the air-pollution,  which is responsible for up to 70% disease of urban area, is also deteriorating.   As final points,  having happy, healthy and well-talented lives depend to having quality health  services and strategies; we must know that if we do not have sound body, we  cannot have sound mind. We should realize that food and food experts play very  important role in a society. We must  understand that Pregnancy and infancy are important periods for the formation  of the brain, laying the foundation for the develÂ­opment of cognitive, motor,  and socio-emotional skills throughout childhood and adulthood. Children with  restricted development of these skills during early life are at risk for later  neuropsychologiÂ­cal problems, poor school achievement, early school dropout,  low-skilled employÂ­ment, and poor care of their own children, thus contributing  to the intergenerational transmission of poverty.","['quality', 'health', 'dangerous', 'place', 'private', 'system', 'afghanistan', 'healthcare', 'services', 'public', 'high', 'poor', 'live', 'care']","Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to live a healthy life.

Afghan Women â The  Victim of Patriarchy,Opinion: A man has been charged with raping his  15-year-old daughter â who is now pregnant and under medical care in Jawzjan  province â local news report. Police criminal...,Hujjatullah Zia,"September 19, 2015","A man has been charged with raping his  15-year-old daughter â who is now pregnant and under medical care in Jawzjan  province â local news report. Police criminal offenses department director Abdul Hadi  confirmed the report and said the man was in police custody. Hadi added that  the man apparently threatened to kill his daughter if she spoke out about the  case. Violence and  violation of rights weighs heavily on women. As long as women are deemed  inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance. As long as  outmoded ways of thinking prevent women from making a meaningful contribution  to society, progress will be slow. As long as the nation refuses to acknowledge  the equal role of more than half of itself, it is doomed to failure.Violence against  women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a  subordinate position compared with men. Moreover, it is the manifestation of an  unequal power between men and women. The images of abused  and helpless Afghan women incessantly flood our minds, undermining the  significant role of women as agents of change in Afghanistan. During the 1920s  and 70s, a period of economic and political stability, a large number of Afghan  women asserted their rights and continued their education and professional  pursuits. These women belonged to a privileged economic background; all the  same their role and aspirations offer the world an alternative narrative.  Acknowledging the agency, contributions, and strong voice of Afghan women does  not undermine the stories of women like Nazai, an 18-year-old Afghan woman  whose nose and ears were sliced off by her husband and appeared on the cover of  Time magazine in August 2010, or Sitara, a 30-year-old women whose nose and  lips were lopped off by her addict husband in Herat province in 2013 and their  audacious spirit. And the appalling story of Farkhunda, who was lynched to  death on March 19 in Kabul, haunted not only Afghan nation but the whole world. The history of Afghan  women’s struggle for social recognition and equality chronicles Afghanistan’s  physical and cultural devastation. Following the Soviet Invasion (1979-89), the  Afghan Civil War (1994-96) and the dictatorial regime of Taliban (1996-2001)  women’s access to education, security and jobs has been minimal. Today, in the  post-Taliban era, the Western “liberation” and Islamic fundamentalism each  impose their own values on Afghan society as political models. Westernization,  with regards to gender equality, does not take into account the traditional  concept of family in Islamic or Afghan culture and tends to negotiate the  rights of Afghan women outside their community and family. The violence against  women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of  their life span. Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this  essentially has an impact on their lives that they are impeded to exercise  their human rights, for instance, the fear for contribution to the development  of their communities socially, economically and politically.The gang rape  occurred in the Paghman district of Kabul was one of the worst cases of  violence against our women. As it is still debated on the national media, armed  men stopped a convoy of cars that was driving back to the city from a wedding  in the district of Paghman in the morning of August 23, 2014. The men dragged  four women to the side of the road, where they robbed them and beat them up,  the screams of the victims in earshot of male relatives they were traveling  with. Three of the women were raped without a tinge of humanity. A research found many  risk factors that increase the chance of Afghan women experiencing domestic  violence. Some of these include being in a forced, underage, or polygamous  marriage, living in rural communities or communities with greater Taliban  control, and the presence of strict gender role perceptions. Factors that decrease  the chance of domestic violence include employment of spouses, consensual  marriage, literacy of both women and men, living in urban communities, enjoying  economic stability, and perceived satisfactory gender relations. It should be noted  that human rights are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights “to  which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human  being,” and which are inherent in all human beings regardless of their gender,  belief, ethnicity, creed or any other status. They are applicable everywhere  and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in  the sense of being the same for everyone. They require empathy and the rule of  law and impose an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others.  They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on  specific circumstances, and require freedom from unlawful imprisonment,  torture, and execution. It is aptly said,  “For every woman and girl violently attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every  woman forced into unprotected sex because men demand this, we destroy dignity  and pride. Every woman who has to sell her life for sex we condemn to a  lifetime in prison. For every moment we remain silent, we conspire against our  women. For every woman infected by HIV, we destroy a generation.”Although the integral  sources of the Afghanistan’s law root in Islamic Sharia which hold human and  his rights, including women’s rights, in high esteem and also our country has ratified  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and ICCPR, yet the human  rights are violated to a large extent and women are bereft of their rights in  some ways. Hope the government acts more seriously and protects the rights of  the citizens, especially the women’s rights.","['victim', 'patriarchy', 'afghan', 'gender', 'men', 'violence', 'womens', 'women', 'woman', 'rights', 'role', 'human']","As long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance.

Uphold the Spirit of Democracy!,"Opinion: Afghanistan has been ravaged  by years of conflict. Subsequent  to Talibanâs regime toppled, Afghanistan was put on the way to democracy, the  established and wide practiced system of ...",Asmatyari,"January 01, 2014","Afghanistan has been ravaged  by years of conflict. Subsequent  to Talibanâs regime toppled, Afghanistan was put on the way to democracy, the  established and wide practiced system of government. Afghan national institutions are  severely factional and lack a cohesive national security culture.  In other  words, Afghan institutions are not sufficiently focused on defending their own  national interests. Influential Afghan figures continue to promote patronage  networks further institutionalizing favoritism and corruption. The Afghan government continues to give free rein to well-known  warlords and human rights abusers as well as corrupt politicians and businesspeople,  further eroding public support. Reconstruction of the economic and political institutions  through better administrative reforms is perhaps the most important means to  ensuring long-term success of a state.The September 11 tragic incidence turned a blessing  in disguise for Afghans that brought Talibanâs repressive and despotic rule to  an end. Subsequently, the modes of government altered but not the fate of  people. The installment of democracy devoid of its fundamental requisites left  the people suffer at the hand of non-conforming elements, insurgents and  terrorists who at present seem to have grown mightier than previous. The centralized  government brought forth, is perceived as continuation of denied political  rights. The completion of two democratic terms and slight  betterment in women rights and a small degree of freedom, of course, count the  successes of the democratic government. The most crucial aspect that left  undermined or ignored must be given prime importance in order to ensure vibrant  democracy, as underlined below.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The  ultimate goal of democracy is to preserve and promote the dignity and  fundamental rights of the individual, to achieve social justice, foster the  economic and social development of the community, strengthen the cohesion of  society and build a favorable environment for international peace. Democracy,  development and human rights are therefore interdependent. The government has  been poor enough to ensure all such provisions of democratic system.It  ascertains peopleâs participation to play an active role in  political and civic life. One expresses his will through regular free and fair  elections. Voting in a democracy must be universal, equal and secret so that  each of us can choose our representatives freely which is not witnessed in Afghanistan  till date. Education and vibrant communications media are vital to be able to  make an informed choice. Literacy rate touches the ground and media is highly  restraint. The roles of citizens end after they cast their ballots; they arenât  continually engaged in public affairs thus they are kept ignorant of their  right and duties.The Afghan population  currently has few means of expressing dissent regarding policies carried out by  the international community and the central government, which operates on a  highly centralized patronage model in which power and resources are channeled  through personal and political allies. The system lacks the connection, rules,  and checks and balances necessary to make leaders truly accountable to the  domestic population, which invites corruption, rent-seeking, and a hemorrhaging  of domestic legitimacy. Local governmental bodies are the appropriate places  for representing Afghans and responding to their needs, but these currently  suffer from a lack of capacity, confusion over their roles and authorities, and  little legitimacy.Incorporating the promotion of equality and  dignity through the system of equal value for the vote of all individuals  regardless of their sex, religion, language, economic or social status in  democracy ensures political justice which is the foundation of social and  economic justice, dignity of the individual and national cohesion.Without  a well-functioning government apparatus, administrative system and an efficient  and productive economy, no state will be able to maintain basic state  functions. The objective is to strengthen planning and auditing activities,  promote quality assurance, implement public welfare policies, organize  management of human resources, maintain ongoing efforts to reform the  administration and fight against corruption, and lay the foundations for  managing finances and procurement. These broad based objectives can be met by  inventing an efficient administrative system that could relief Afghanistan out  of lingering administrative problems.In that pursuit a  democratic institution must be built on structures and processes that are  accountable, transparent, decentralized, and able to manage legitimate  elections and the administration of justice, and operate under the oversight of  the parliament. Furthermore, it should combat exclusion, protect public goods,  actively engage civil society and the private sector, promote participation,  and strengthen partnerships among sectors, groups, and every levels of  government. Revitalizing public administration for people-centered development  would require reform efforts that incorporate these characteristics.Effective and efficient administrative  system, including public sector management, promotes and strengthens democracy and  good governance. An effectively functioning civil service is essential in order  to ensure that democratically elected leaders are able to protect the rights of  citizens and mobilize resources through taxes and other sources in order to pay  for police, judges, and the provision of services.Â  A consolidated democracy requires  administrative capacity of the state to maintain law and order, and to promote  and protect public goods such as environment.Â   Public confidence in the political system and subsequently the political  legitimacy of the government â is increased where the public service delivery  system is effective, where the public officials are accessible to local citizens,  and where government agencies and departments work together in well coordinated,  complementary ways. Equally important is the capacity to govern, to make  important policy choices, design and implement programs and actions to achieve policy  objectives, and anticipate emerging trends and challenges.Â  Public sector management capacity to perform  the above and related tasks, however, requires merit based recruitment of  qualified personnel, effective human resource development strategies,  motivation and commitment of civil servants, and transparent processes for policy  formulation, budgeting, and implementation.Â Â Â Â Â  Good governance, the prime pre-requisite of  Afghanistan, refers to the question of how a society can organize itself to  ensure equality of opportunity and equity (social and economic justice) for all  citizens. Good governance is a value in itself, but it is also the most  critical means to achieve the Millennium Development Goals â the eradication of  extreme poverty and hunger, the achievement of universal primary education, the  promotion of gender equality, the reduction of child mortality, the improvement  of maternal health, the fight against HIV/AIDS, polio and other diseases, and  the promotion of environmental sustainability and a global partnership for  development. The government established on sound grounds of protection and  promotion of right of every individual, is liable to achieve the heart and soul  of masses and universal development goal alike âsuch act of governing is in  fact in accordance to sprite of democracy.","['uphold', 'administrative', 'promote', 'system', 'development', 'democracy', 'spirit', 'justice', 'social', 'public', 'rights', 'political']","The centralized government brought forth, is perceived as continuation of denied political rights.

New Poppy Blight Poised  to Boost Opium Price: U.N.,"News: VIENNA - A fresh blight is poised to hit Afghanistan's poppy fields this year, driving up opium prices and threatening to fuel a shift to potentially lethal heroin substitutes like ""krokodil"", the U.N. drugs watchdog said on  ...",Daily Outlook Afghanistan,"June 28, 2012","VIENNA - A fresh blight is poised to hit Afghanistan's poppy fields this year, driving up opium prices and threatening to fuel a shift to potentially lethal heroin substitutes like ""krokodil"", the U.N. drugs watchdog said on Tuesday.  Plant diseases destroyed nearly half the 2010 opium harvest in Afghanistan, the world's biggest producer, but output there rebounded 61 percent last year, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its 2012 World Drug Report.  That helped put global opium production at 7,000 metric tons (7716.2 tons) in 2011, still more than a fifth below the 2007 peak.""We may anticipate that this year there will be another plant disease - maybe not to the same scale as 2010 - but (it) still may affect, especially in the southern part of Afghanistan, poppy cultivation,"" UNODC Executive Director Yuri Fedotov said.""This means that the production of opium may not increase or may even decrease, but at the same time definitely it would lead to an increase in prices for the next year. That is something we need to address very seriously.""The UNODC report cited indications that shortages had encouraged users in some countries to replace heroin with other substances such as desomorphine - whose street name is krokodil - acetylated opium, and synthetic narcotics.  Krokodil is a crude, codeine-based drug that users inject, risking serious health problems as it attacks body tissue.""It is a powerful drug which can kill people in just two months, in a few weeks,"" Fedotov said.  It was hard to gauge what impact the 2010 crop failure in Afghanistan had on major markets, the report said, but drug seizures fell in most countries getting Afghan opiates. Some European countries, including Britain and Russia, saw heroin droughts.  Opiate prices in Europe and the Americas had not changed much since 2009, officials said, but farm-gate prices in Afghanistan and number-two producer Myanmar kept rising in 2010 and 2011. A kilo of opium costs around $200-$250 in Afghanistan.  Rising prices at times of increasing output could reflect under-reported demand from Asia and Africa, a growing market for raw opium not made into heroin, a parallel market for morphine or speculation on local markets, the report said.  Drug syndicates also tended to stockpile opium to be able to smooth out supply fluctuations, UNODC officials said.  CANNABIS ON TOP  The 2012 report showed overall use of illicit drugs seems to have stabilized but was on the rise in several developing countries, especially those along trafficking routes.Fedotov cited as an example growing consumption of cocaine in West Africa, now a transit route for shipping Latin American supplies to Europe, increasingly from Bolivia and Peru as output in Colombia - mainly bound for North America - declines.  Cannabis remained the world's most popular illicit drug, with between 119 million and 224 million established users worldwide, the report said.That was followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), the use of which was largely stable, although methamphetamine and ecstasy appeared to be on the rise.  Seizures of methamphetamine more than doubled in 2010 from 2008 due to big hauls in central America and Asia. Ecstasy pill seizures more than doubled in Europe from 2009 to 2010, and the drug's use seemed to be rising in the United States and Oceania.  The report stressed the health and security threats illicit drugs posed, renewing UNODC's call for an integrated approach to reducing both supply and demand.""Heroin, cocaine and other drugs continue to kill around 200,000 people a year, shattering families and bringing misery to thousands of other people, insecurity and the spread of HIV,"" Fedotov said.  Around 230 million people, roughly five percent of the world's adult population, are estimated to have used an illicit drug at least once in 2010. Around 27 million, or 0.6 percent of adults, are problem drug users, mainly of heroin and cocaine.  By contrast, surveys have shown 42 percent of adults drink alcohol and a quarter use tobacco.Fedotov said his agency was looking into reports that Uruguay's government planned to legalize the marijuana market as part of a drive to stop rising crime.""If these reports are confirmed, of course it will be a disappointing development,"" he told reporters, citing international conventions against such a step.  ""Cannabis is not so innocent as some people prefer to describe (it),"" he said, noting its users faced irreversible physiological changes and often moved on to harder drugs.

Maltreating Women â An Unending Issue,"Editorial: A report has released that a teenage girl was found dead  after being kidnapped in Nahor District of Ghazni province. Her parents said  that the girl, who was engaged, received threats  ...",Ali Bahrami,"January 12, 2015","A report has released that a teenage girl was found dead  after being kidnapped in Nahor District of Ghazni province. Her parents said  that the girl, who was engaged, received threats from three men who live in  their village alleging that the intimidators were involved in the crime. Her  old mother, who had turned obsessive after her daughter’s death, urged the  judiciary board to take a serious action in this regard and do not free the  murderers with impunity.Â  Nahor is a remote village in Ghazni district, where women  work hard from dawn to dusk twenty-four/seven. Women and men work side by side  on the farms. Additionally, women babysit while working on the farms and grin  and bear it. Moreover, violence against women takes place every now and then.  As a result, it is remembered vividly when a man shot his wife dead a few years  ago and also killed his cousin claiming to be in contact with his wife â the  claim which remained unsupported by documents. Violence and violation of rights weighs heavily on women. As  long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack  substance. As long as outmoded ways of thinking prevent women from making a  meaningful contribution to society, progress will be slow. As long as the  nation refuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half of itself, it is  doomed to failure.The violence against women can occur in both public and  private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Many women are  terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially has an impact on  their lives that they are impeded to exercise their human rights, for instance,  the fear for contribution to the development of their communities socially,  economically and politically.On 13 November 2014 â The United Nations Special Rapporteur  on violence against women, Rashida Manjoo, has called on the Government of  Afghanistan and the international community to adopt sustainable measures to  address the causes and consequences of gender-based violence in the country.Â Wrapping up a  nine-day official visit to the country, Ms. Manjoo warned in a statement that  violence against women in Afghanistan continues to be a source of deep concern,  despite positive legislative and institutional developments brought forward  amid a situation of insecurity throughout the country.“Accountability for all crimes committed against women and girls,  the empowerment of women, and the transformation of society, need to remain a  focus for the Government of Afghanistan, independent State institutions, civil  society organizations and also the international community,” she stressed.Moreover, Manjoo noted with concern that many women and  girls continue to lack access to the formal justice system. Her investigation  also found problems with corruption within the justice system as well as  distrust concerning the ability of the courts to appropriately adjudicate  matters related to women’s rights. These factors combine with societal pressure  to push women and girls outside of the formal justice system to resolve  disputes.Â Afghan women and  girls are reluctant to report crimes of violence. Manjoo reported several  reasons, including “lack of knowledge of the law and its protective remedial  provisions; fear of reprisal from the perpetrators and family members;  financial and other constraints, including the lack of freedom of movement; and  fear of being treated as criminals instead of victims, when reporting crimes  committed against them.”Elzira Sagynbaeva, the representative of UN Women in  Afghanistan, said violence against women and girls remains endemic. ""It  constitutes a serious violation of human rights impeding women’s full  realization of their civil, political, social, cultural and economic and  development rights,"" she said in a statement on November 25.Despite the situation of insecurity throughout the country,  it is clear that there have been legislative and institutional developments.  This is a reflection of political will in addressing the promotion and  protection of women’s rights which is further reflected in the appointments of  women in high level positions. However, such developments should not detract  from the fact that violence against women continues to be a source of deep  concern in Afghanistan. Currently, there is no comprehensive and coherent data  collection mechanism to enable either government or the public at large to  fully grasp the magnitude of the phenomenon in the country. Despite government  agencies and civil society organizations collecting statistics, these estimates  are disputed, depending on whom one speaks to or receives information from. The  lack of effective interpretation and implementation of laws and policies  requires attention by the government of Afghanistan, as does the issue of the  allocation of appropriate resources to enable sustainable solutions. It is rightly said, “For every woman and girl violently  attacked, we reduce our humanity. For every woman forced into unprotected sex  because men demand this, we destroy dignity and pride. Every woman who has to  sell her life for sex we condemn to a lifetime in prison. For every moment we  remain silent, we conspire against our women. For every woman infected by HIV,  we destroy a generation.”The National Unity Government has to end the political and  social challenges of the Afghan people. Insecurity and sufferings are  disheartening our people with each passing day. Yet, the government has turned  a blind eye to the social problems. Hope the new government breaks the deadlock  and put their electoral agenda in practice as soon as possible and prioritize  the elimination of violence against women.","['maltreating', 'girls', 'manjoo', 'society', 'issue', 'afghanistan', 'lack', 'woman', 'womens', 'women', 'violence', 'rights', 'unending']","As long as women are deemed inferior and looked down upon, human rights will lack substance.

Relation of Natural Disaster and Sin,"News: On Sunday, when I was making my way amidst crowd that  similarly was struggling not to get muddied as result of flash floods  overpowered roads, a group of old men were sitting on the  ...",Daily Outlook Afghanistan,"May 06, 2014","On Sunday, when I was making my way amidst crowd that  similarly was struggling not to get muddied as result of flash floods  overpowered roads, a group of old men were sitting on the side of the road and  blaming the prevalence of immorality as the main reason behind the natural  disaster. They were of the view that landslide in Badakhshan province and flash  floods in other provinces which have left hundreds dead and thousands homeless  happen due to less commitment of people to religious issues and that is why  Allah Almighty descent such natural disaster to punish people for their sin.Â  One of them told that would people remain  safe when a religious scholar raped an innocent girl? By saying so, he pointed  to incident occurred in Baghlan province. Based on reports, a religious scholar  by tricking wanted to rape her. But before he rapes, the father of the girl cuts  the nose and ear of the Mullah. Religious scholars hold deep reverence and high influence  among Afghan people, particularly in rural areas. Believe it or not, if a  religious scholar opposes anything on whatever account, people will accept his  stance and withhold not support. In other words, Mullahs are viewed as  infallible and the very standard of good and bad. Some people view that as  symbol of right and wrong---whatever they accept that is right and vice versa for  their opposition. On the other hand, such deep reverence and respect has imposed  a very critical responsibility on the shoulder of religious scholars. Their  every step is watched. Thus, they should carefully dress and be so committed to  religious issues. They offer prayer on time and do not miss any religious  rituals without any acceptable excuses. Hence, if they commit any mistake their religious status  wide acceptance among common people will get seriously affected. So, if for  years, people used stand on behind Mullah and offered their and followed his  instructions, suddenly they find out that perhaps was the kind of person they  trusted. Certainly that would be a serious emotional blow to common people. Moreover, Mullahs are considered the symbol of religiosity. They  viewed as the most trustable and spiritual figures. It is hard for common  people to accept that someone who spiritual and aware of religious issues or  simply the committed followers of Prophet Mohammad commit an adultery which to  some extent is considered the most horrible moral crime. Thediscussion of group  of old man indirectly was pointing to the same issue. If similar crime was  committed by a common man or letâs say a non-Madressah educated person, people  may not have reacted so harshly. For this category of people, adultery by a  Mullah is sign of closeness of resurrection day or anger of Allah Almighty  against sinful human beings. The interesting part is this that when similar natural  disaster occur in non-Muslim countries, people start talking similar things  about the anger of Allah Almighty against sinful residents. Now when such  natural incidents take place in areas where people are generally good from a  particular religious perspective that common people, they get confused about  what is really wrong. No doubt, these spiritual concepts have been among human  beings perhaps since their very familiarity with concept of God and  spirituality and reflected differently in different religious groups. They were  reflected in one or the other but interesting no body lose believes even when  such concepts prove baseless and wrong. There is always justification takes the  hands of people and their beliefs remain intact. For example, when a natural  hit people, the reason behind is said to be sin and Allah punishes them. So,  when the mountain slide removes reportedly 300 hundred homes of villagers, than  it is related to sin of people in other parts of the country. In this  philosophy, human beings are considered as jangle soil. If a jangle gets fired,  all of them may get burned. And so, for the sin of an individual, thousands  must pay the price. For instance, top religious scholars of Islamic republic  just years ago were criticizing western countries and branding HIV as curse of  Allah Almighty because of moral corruption. But soon the diseases spread in  Islamic countries and now no one can claim that it is curse of Allah Almighty  for the Western countries. Needless to say, modern individualism has not found its way  to this collective mentality. For the sin of an individual, many are  responsible. Just putting a glimpse to society, we can easily found that such  collective thinking is visible in each corner of peopleâs lives. As said, for  the sin of an individual many are responsible. For example, if a girl gets  raped, not only the rapist is sinful but his entire family members or his  community. Sometimes punishment of the criminal is enough from traditional  court but number of others from the same community or those who related to him  by blood should get punished. Thus, during history for a small crimes, the entire  community has got blamed not only the individual. If a girl escape with a boy,  along with the boy other community should pay the price. Â Baad or marrying girl for resolving disputes sometimes  happen because of the same collective punishment. It is highly likely that once  individuals spread and everyone is responsible for their own deeds, part of  social and legal issues will be resolved and a Mullah may not lose ear and nose  for sin he just wanted to commit.","['disaster', 'religious', 'allah', 'sin', 'community', 'relation', 'girl', 'common', 'almighty', 'issues', 'individual', 'natural']","Thus, they should carefully dress and be so committed to religious issues.
For this category of people, adultery by a Mullah is sign of closeness of resurrection day or anger of Allah Almighty against sinful human beings.
The interesting part is this that when similar natural disaster occur in non-Muslim countries, people start talking similar things about the anger of Allah Almighty against sinful residents.
For example, when a natural hit people, the reason behind is said to be sin and Allah punishes them.
But soon the diseases spread in Islamic countries and now no one can claim that it is curse of Allah Almighty for the Western countries."
