DENPASAR

The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Denpasar reached 2,408 as of March 2012, an official said.

“The Denpasar community are heterogeneous and have high mobility, so we do not rule out the possibility that the number of HIV/AIDS cases will increase. These HIV/AIDS cases are just the tip of the iceberg,” head of the Denpasar City AIDS Prevention Commission I Gusti Ngurah Jaya Negara said.

The number of HIV/AIDS cases included 1,218 HIV carriers consisting of 457 women and 761 men, said Negara, who is also Denpasar’s deputy mayor.

He said the number of AIDS cases alone reached 1,190 consisting of 376 women and 814 men.

“We have tried to handle the cases by making all elements of the community, including students, cafe workers, massage-parlour workers and commercial sex workers aware of the danger of HIV/AIDS,” he said.

Meanwhile, Ketut Sukanata, a member of the Bali Provincial AIDS Prevention Commission, said the number of HIV/AIDS cases in Bali was rising significantly every year.

“In 2010, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS reached 4,210. The figure rose to 5,222 at the end of 2011,” he said.

Of the total, 1,197 were 20-29 years old, 969 were 30-39 years old, 333 were 40-59 years old and 19 were less than one year old, he said.

The number of known HIV/AIDS cases in Bali is soaring, with one in four prostitutes reported to be HIV-positive, an official said.

A new report by the National AIDS Commission said the number of HIV infections on the island had jumped almost 19 percent to 3,778 this year, with another 597 cases.

“The figure is only the tip of the iceberg… we estimate the actual number of cases to hover around 7,000 as many cases were unreported,” the commission’s spokesman in Bali, Nyoman Mangku Karmaya, said on Sunday.

“Many people are reluctant to go for medical check-ups as there’s still a stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS,” he said.

The number of cases this year has risen sharply from 1,253 cases in 2006 and 590 in 2004.

Karmaya said about 25 percent of the estimated 8,800 sex workers in Bali were infected with HIV this year, up from 23 percent last year, adding that the virus was transmitted from clients who refused to use condoms.

While describing the trend as “worrying,” he said most tourists visit Bali for the culture and scenery, not for sex.

“There might be some who get acquainted with the sex workers, but they’re aware about using condoms,” Karmaya said.

However, he warned that there could be more than 840 new infections in Bali every year if the spread is not contained.

“We will increase our efforts to provide more information and educate the sex workers as well as the public. We’ll also intensify campaigns promoting condom use,” he added.

Vice Governor of Bali, Ketut Sudikerta proposes a mobile service to detect patients of HIV/ AIDS as an effort to optimize prevention on the sexual-transmitted disease.

“We will make a blood test mobile car program, which will be spread to various rural areas in Bali. If from the blood test, there are the positive ones, treatment will be directly done,” he said when received the Team Leader of HIV Cooperation Program for Indonesia (HCPI) Catherine Barker in Denpasar.

According to him, many HIV/AIDS patients in Bali who are not in the list yet. Based on the data from Department of Health Bali Province, the number of people indicated having HIV/AIDS cumulatively is just 8,141 cases.

In fact, actually it is predicted to reach 26,000 patients. This estimation is based on the observation on HIV/AIDS spread in Bali and the survey in 2012 by involving 2,000 respondents.

“This validation data is really needed to optimize the effort to prevent HIV/ AIDS that is more alarming,” he said.

The government of Bali Province, Sudikerta added, has commitment in preventing and treating HIV/ AIDS. It is proved by the increasing fund allocation that is quite significant.

“If previously, only Rp500 millions is budgeted, now the government of Bali Province allocate the budget up to Rp6 billion. In the future, we expect that collaboration with HCTVI could be continuously improved,” said the man who is also the Daily Chair of AIDS Prevention Commission of Bali Province.

DENPASAR

Bali’s Health Department has reiterated demands for clarification and evidence from the Australian authorities over claims that a tourist from West Australia contracted HIV after getting a tattoo in Bali.

The claims emerged after Australian broadcaster ABC News reported that the West Australian Health Department was stating that a patient had contracted HIV after getting a tattoo in Bali. The patient’s details were not revealed, but the story was titled “Getting a tattoo in Bali is like having unprotected sex.”

The ABC report did not identify the tattoo parlour involved in the allegations, but stated that travel warnings would be issued for those heading to Bali.

West Australia’s director of communicable disease control, Paul Armstrong, was quoted as saying that anyone who had got a tattoo or piercing in Bali should be tested for HIV.

The allegations have been strongly contested by local tattooists, and last week Health Department head I Nyoman Sutedja said that no clear information about the case had been forwarded by the his West Australian counterparts.

“We have held a meeting with the Australian Consulate and representatives from AusAid several days ago. I demanded clarification and information on the victim’s background to determine whether the victim was infected when getting a tattoo in Bali,” he said, adding that it was essential to know the identity of the tattoo parlour at the centre of the claims if the Balinese authorities were to take action.

Sutedja said that in response to the claims the department had already conducted checks at many local tattoo parlours in Kuta.

“Based on our data, there are at least 37 permanent parlours. The other parlours are mobile, usually offering tattoo services at beaches and other places,” he said, adding that the department would issue further guidance about safe practice to all local tattooists. He said that based on the recent checks most parlours were already following strict hygiene procedures.

Sutedja said that without access to the unnamed Australian’s medical records proving the source of the infection would be impossible.

“So far, there has yet to be a case of HIV in Bali caused by getting a tattoo,” he said, adding that according to department data unprotected heterosexual sex was by far the biggest source of new infections, accounting for 74 percent of HIV cases in Bali.

A total of 33 foreigners who once visited or stayed in the Indonesian tourist resort province of Bali suffered from HIV/AIDS, a local AIDS Commission (KPA) said here.

Dr Mangku Karmaya, prevention working group coordinator of Bali’s KPA, said the data were collected from 1987 to 2013.

The citizenships of sixteen of the 33 sufferers were not known. Seventeen others came from Timor Leste and the United States (respectively four people), France (two), Australia, the Netherlands, Canada, Europe, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland.

Mangku Karma said the first foreigner to die of AIDS in Bali in 1987 came from the Netherlands.

The number of HIV/AIDS suffers in Bali in the last 27 years has reached 7,291, of which 3,459 were HIVE carriers and 3,832 were AIDS suffers.

He said that the number of suffers indicated that HIV/AIDS cases in Bali have spread to rural areas, expressing concern with the growing number of HIV/AIDS cases, the number of HIV/AIDS cases in Bali has increased from year to year.

Most or 75 percent of the disease was attributable to heterosexual relationships, and 11.08 percent to drugs, 4.16 percent to homosexual and the rest to other causes, he said.

He said most of the victim are in the productive age groups– around 40.19 percent or 2,930 cases in the age group of 20-29 years and 36.33 percent or 2,649 cases in the age group of 30-39 years.

He said various steps have been made to make people more aware of the danger of the disease hoping the cases could be reduced in the future.

HIV/AIDs cases in Bali have spread to rural areas in the province, the provincial AIDs Control Commission said.

SURABAYA

A potential herbal cure for HIV/AIDs is being investigated and developed by researchers at the University of Airlangga in Surabaya.

Nasronudin, an academic who heads the university’s Institute of Tropical Disease, said that the research has already taken two years and that the project team hopes the final product will be ready sometime next year.

He said several active substances from a number of plants have been studied, and substances from two plants have been found, based on invitro laboratory tests, as having the ability to reduce the count of human immunodeficiency viruses.

The two plants currently undergoing tests are the Justicia gendarussa and the Camelia sinesis.

Due to the positive results, Nasronudin explained, the next step was to commence tests on “living beings, from animals to humans.”

He added that the final research results will provide clues for a possible cure and that the actual production would be handed over to a pharmaceutical company for mass production.

Nasronudin said the treatment would be an antiretroviral (ARV) medicine, a treatment that assists HIV/AIDS patients to lower the virus count in their blood.

“Hopefully, Indonesia can produce HIV/AIDS medicine on its own, so that we do not need to continue to import it. If we create the medication ourselves, the price can be cheaper and therefore the coverage wider. That way all those who need this cure can access it.”

An American man is still HIV-free more than three years after receiving a stem cell transplant, suggesting the first-ever cure of the virus that causes AIDS, German doctors have said.

But while the highly risky technique used on the man known as the “Berlin Patient” would not work for most of the 33 million people with HIV worldwide, scientists say the research shows important progress toward a universal cure.

“Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,” said the study in the peer-reviewed journal Blood, a publication of the American Society of Hematology.

The process began in 2006 when a US man in his 40s, who had been HIV positive for more than a decade, sought treatment for acute myeloid leukemia, a lethal blood cancer.

After a first round of chemotherapy failed, his German doctor, Gero Hutter, thought he would see if he could perform a bone marrow transplant using a donor with a rare genetic mutation that is naturally resistant to HIV.

About one in 100 Caucasian people, or one percent of the population, have the mutation, known as Delta 32, inherited from both parents which prevents the protein CCR5 from appearing on the cell surface.

Since HIV enters the cell through CCR5 molecules, when they are absent HIV cannot penetrate.

The process was not easy, but after rejecting dozens of potential donors Hutter finally found a match and performed the bone marrow transplant using stem cells from the HIV-resistant donor in February 2007.

Hutter’s first study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2009, showed no sign that HIV had re-emerged even though the patient had ceased anti-retroviral therapy to suppress HIV.

The latest findings show that the patient, 44-year-old Timothy Ray Brown, continues to show no trace of either the AIDS-causing virus or leukemia.

But because Brown’s ordeal left him temporarily unable to walk or talk and statistics showing around 30 percent of patients do not survive bone marrow transplants, AIDS experts sounded a note of caution.

“I think we need a lot more research to try to replicate this without putting a patient’s life in danger,” said Karen Tashima, director of the HIV Clinical Trials Program at The Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island.

“Since we have good anti-retroviral therapy that can control the virus, it would be unethical to give somebody such an extreme treatment.”

Lead study author Kristina Allers acknowledged that the process would not work for most people.

“Nevertheless, as the study tells us that (an) HIV cure is in principle possible, it gives new hope for scientists in HIV cure research,” Allers said.

“So the next challenge is to translate our findings into a strategy that can be applied without being life-threatening.”

Indeed, US researchers are already working on ways to replicate the same process in the cells without going the same risky route.

“I am very excited about it,” said David Baltimore, a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1975.

Baltimore is the founder of a biotech company that is working on developing its own stem-cell HIV/AIDS therapy that works functionally the same as the German team’s, and is in the process of organizing clinical trials, he said.

“What we are trying to do is treat a patient’s own cells so there is no immunological problem,” he said.

“The fact that the one patient who was treated then was effectively cured is I think a very strong argument that you want to continue this kind of approach to the HIV problem.”

Jay Levy, an AIDS and cancer researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, described the latest research as evidence of a “functional cure.”

“I mean, one person is not sufficient. It is an encouraging first step but you really need to show it again,” he said.

“I always look on this as a direction for future approaches, recognize what the problems are and then see if we can do better, and I have faith in my scientific colleagues to come up with something better.”

Levy and his team are also looking at ways to manipulate a patient’s own stem cells so that they do not express the receptors that allow HIV infection, much like the CCR5 mutation.

“Three years is not enough… We will know that in 10 years,” said Levy regarding the study’s assertion that a cure has been found.

“It is too early to say you’ve cured, but my Lord, they have done a nice job.”

By Aubrey Belford

Agence France-Presse

WAMENA ~ Gaunt and covered in sores, 20-year-old Christina Mabele is a rarity in the ballooning AIDS crisis that has hit the remote Papua region in eastern Indonesia: she knows why she is sick.

Sitting in a hospice in this highlands town, which much of the time is only accessible to the outside world by plane, Mabele might get treatment in time.

But her friend Juliana Halo did not.

“She was a friend of mine, we sat together in school, but yesterday she died. She was the same age as me,” Mabele said.

Papua, a vast territory of tropical jungles and jagged mountain peaks on the western edge of New Guinea island, has seen an explosion in HIV/AIDS cases among a population that is the poorest in Indonesia.

Its infection rate, estimated at 2.4 out of every 100 people, is one of the highest outside Africa. And it is set to rise.

Foreign journalists are usually barred from visiting Papua, which has been under Indonesian control since the 1960s and is home to a low-level independence insurgency.

AFP was granted access under escort by an officer of Indonesia’s state intelligence agency.

While HIV/AIDS rates in the rest of Indonesia are low, a combination of poverty, distance, lack of education and plenty of sex is driving infections in Papua, according to the government AIDS commission.

The disease is hitting hardest in remote regions like the Baliem Valley, which was untouched by the outside world until after World War II and where many men go naked except for long, pointed gourds over their penises.

Amos Alua, a worker with the Yukemdi independent organization that tries to educate highlanders about the disease, indicates the scale of the problem by sweeping his hand toward the jungled peaks that rise around the valley.

In those vast mountains, accessible only by light planes or days of walking on tracks that rise precipitously from the valley floor, people are dying but do not know why, Alua said.

“Behind the mountains, they still don’t know about HIV/AIDS. They’re infected but they don’t know it,” he said.

What makes Papua’s HIV/AIDS problem so bad, in short, is sex, according to health experts. Injecting drug use, which is a major source of transmission elsewhere, is not a serious factor here.

Despite widespread poverty, the sex industry is booming in towns across Papua as money rolls in from natural resources under a new system of “special autonomy” with Indonesia, said Jack Morin, the head of population research at Papua’s Cendrawasih University.

A sizeable minority of Papuan men are travelling vast distances – often by foot – for work or to go to markets, having sex with prostitutes in towns, and then bringing infections back to their villages, Morin said.

This is then compounded by high-risk sex in the villages. Papuans know little of condoms and in many places tradition – and in other places encroaching modernity – mean a significant minority are having unprotected sex with multiple partners.

“A number of tribes believe that if semen is thrown away outside of the vagina it can wreck plants, their gardens won’t be fertile, people can get sick or it can be used for black magic,” he said.

A recent conference of non-governmental organizations, government and international donors in the provincial capital Jayapura showed the world is waking up to the crisis, with tens of millions of dollars set to roll in for treatment and prevention.

Governor Barnabas Suebu has also thrown his support behind some questionable plans, such as a scheme to microchip some HIV/AIDS victims and, he told AFP, encouraging the infected to drink pandanus palm fruit juice.

Some local leaders are prickly about Papuans being stigmatized as immoral or primitive, said Helena Picarina, who heads the Papua HIV/AIDS program of Family Health International non-governmental organization.

“It’s a very sensitive issue. If you talk about it, some of them, church people and politicians, will reject it and say it’s not our behavior,” she said.

Education also remains desperately inadequate. Baliem villagers are largely unaware of the virus or attribute its spread to flies, or sharing food or cigarette butts.

Parti, a 40-year-old prostitute from far-off Java island who has sex with men behind a tumbledown roadside shack selling soft drinks, said she knew condoms stopped HIV but often let men go ahead without them.

“If we take a look at their appearance, see if they’re clean, we can tell if they’re infected,” she said, adding that she takes antibiotics as a precaution.

With thousands of Indonesian soldiers and a history of human rights abuses towards indigenous Papuans, mistrust of the government also poisons much of the HIV/AIDS fight.

Some prominent Papuan leaders have denounced HIV/AIDS as a “genocide” plot by the government, pointing to the growing number of migrants from other parts of Indonesia who already outnumber Papuans in major coastal cities.

They also point to prostitutes such as Parti, who come to Papua in their hundreds in search of higher wages, as deliberate weapons in this alleged conspiracy.

The belief is pervasive. During a visit to Wamena’s hospital, a Papuan man lingered until AFP’s intelligence minder was out of earshot before furtively saying: “This is happening on purpose.”

Joram Yogobi, an indigenous Papuan who heads the Yukemdi NGO in Wamena, said such conspiracy theories get in the way of efforts to promote condoms and other preventative measures, by shifting the blame on to a resented government.

“What we say is: Whether genocide is real or not, we’re already dying,” he said.

Indonesian AIDS commission head Nafsiah Mboi said the government hopes its efforts to tackle HIV/AIDS will dispel the Papuans’ fears.

“Every single Papuan is valuable to this nation and that is why we are supporting them,” she said.

Authorities of Nigeria’s University of Benin (UNIBEN) located in the capital of southern Edo State announced the discovery of a new herbal drug that can cure the dreaded Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), urging carriers of the disease to give it a try.

Dean of the School of Basic Medical Sciences of UNIBEN Isaiah Ibeh unveiled the herbal drug to reporters, saying it had undergone series of successful tests at the laboratory and by medical experts both in Nigeria and the United States of America, where it passed through more critical tests.

“We are at the threshold of making history, in the sense that we seem to have with us something that will permanently take care of what over time seems to have defied all solutions. We are talking about the latest discovery of an oral drug made from plants extraction in Nigeria for the possible cure of the pandemic, HIV and AIDS virus,” he said, adding that research on the project had commenced in 2010 and culminated in the development of the liquid drug known as Deconction X (DX) or Bioclean 11, for the cure of HIV/AIDS.

“The existing retroviral drugs are intervention drugs for the management of AIDS, but our new discovery is a possible cure,” he said further.

According to Ibeh, the university had tried to look at the herbal drug first, as well as its toxicological analysis and discovered that it has a large safety margin before unveiling it to the public. “This means that if animals or human beings are exposed to it, they will not suffer any serious harm at all from the exposure,” he said.

The Nigerian university also claimed to have obtained a refreshing and revealing result, having done bacteriological analysis on the drug, after which it looked at its effect on the virus. “The drug had performed well on patients with the HIV virus and had shown evidence of total restoration of damaged tissues. The result showed an increase in the body weight of the individuals administered with DX,” Ibeh said.

He said further tests were being conducted to determine the point at which a patient will prove negative after being administered the drug, explaining that this verification became necessary because it is what is used to measure whether an infection was still there or not.

“Preliminary results showed that of the five latest patients orally administered with the drugs within seven months, three of them were siro negative while two were still faintly positive,” he explained, while appealing to government and other relevant bodies to assist the university with relevant equipment to sustain the research.

Rare Strain of AIDS Virus ‘Moves Beyond Cameroon’ - The Bali Times,"A very rare strain of AIDS virus previously found only among a few people in Cameroon has most probably spread outside the West African country, according to a case reported by The Lancet medical journal.

A very rare strain of AIDS virus previously found only among a few people in Cameroon has most probably spread outside the West African country, according to a case reported by The Lancet medical journal.

The first identified infection with the so-called “group N” strain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was found in 1998 in a Cameroonian woman who had progressed to AIDS.

Since then, more than 12,000 HIV-infected patients living in Cameroon have been tested for group-N infection, but only 12 cases, including two couples, have ever been found.

The new case, reported by French doctors, involves a 57-year-old man who was admitted to the Saint Louis Hospital Paris in January suffering from fever, rash, swollen lymph glands and genital ulceration.

The patient had high levels of a virus in the HIV-1 family, but tests to pinpoint the particular strain proved inconclusive. On February 9, the patient developed facial paralysis.

The French team then carried out further tests on blood samples, which were found to react in an antibody essay of the N strain.

Tracing his sexual history, the researchers believe the infection was “probably” acquired from intercourse with a partner in Togo, from which he had just returned.

“This case of HIV-1 group-N primary infection indicates that this rare group is now circulating outside Cameroon, which emphasises the need for rigorous HIV epidemiological monitoring,” says the doctors, led by Professor Francois Simon.

The finding is important because the patient suffered not only severe symptoms but also a fast-track decline in his immune system, as shown in the number of his CD4 white blood cells.

He was given a powerful five-drug combination of antiretrovirals, to which he responded, but needs close monitoring in the future, the letter said.

Group N may have leapt to humans from chimpanzees, possibly through the handling of bushmeat infected with the simian equivalent of HIV, scientists say.

It is one of four subtypes of virus gathered in the HIV-1 family, the others being M, which is by far the most prevalent, O and P. The P strain, like O and N very rare, may have jumped to humans from gorillas, according to a study published in 2009.

There is also a minority viral family called HIV-2, which also may have passed to humans from animal primates.

Head of Dauh Peken village I Gusti Komang Wastana said the program was important to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS cases in the area, which have been drastically increasing over the past few years.

“It doesn’t look like we have so many HIV/AIDS cases, but many people have yet to be tested. I fear we can only see the tip of the iceberg,” Wastana said.

He said he hoped the program would show people how to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS.

“Hopefully, the program will better educate prostitutes about the importance of getting tested for HIV regularly and teach them how to protect themselves and their clients from this deadly virus,” he said.

DENPASAR

Awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention among commercial sex workers in the city of Denpasar and Badung regency has increased, said the Program Manager of Kerti Praja Foundation Dewa Nyoman Suyetna.

“Before the awareness to check-up for HIV / AIDS is very low, but now it is easier. Especially after the KPA (Commission on HIV / AIDS Prevention) facilitates and establishes working groups,” he said in Denpasar.

The working group was formed in the operational spots of PSK that is equipped with a structure of administrations whoare usually working under the coordination of each procuress.

“In Denpasar and Badung regency at least 11 working groups formed since the first time in 2009. The boss of procuress now is very cooperative to help preventing HIV / AIDS. In the past, instead of distributing condoms, socializing was difficult,” he said.

The success of cooperation among KPA, Kerti Praja Foundation, and the working groups in preventing HIV / AIDS, Suyetna said that it can be seen from the behavior of sex workers who had lined up since morning to have health check-upat the health center.

“Previously, we have to pick-up for any examination, we provide a taxi, and even we bang their doors to wake them up for having any check-up. Quite often we wait for them having a shower and taxi costs for the pickup reached up to Rp 5 million per month, now their awareness is incredible,” he said.

PSK used to not take any condoms given by KPA. But now the procuresses even have to contact YKP to ask for condoms.

“The sex workers who have declared positive for AIDS must be accompanied strictly for taking their ARVs. If they do not drink it, then the virus will infect up much easier. Meanwhile, if the virus is suppressed by taking ARVs, the patients’immune will rise and their possibility to transmit the disease becomes much smaller, “he said.

With the working groups, said Suyetna, procuresses have to report if there is a new hire and they have to contact the closest health centers or NGOs working on AIDS. The number of sex workers in Denpasar is approximately 1,000 people.

“Later we will provide counseling. Similarly, they should prepare their workers when there is counseling, encouraging them to have check-up for sexually transmitted infections (IMS), they should provide condoms and encouraging its use and so on that becomes the deal and there is consequence for any violation,” he said.

Meanwhile, based on data from the KPA Bali, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in Bali cumulatively from 1987 to March 2013 reached 7,551 people with the detail as follows, bisexual risk group (24), heterosexual (5.807), homosexual (322), IDU (810), perinatal (226), tattoos (2), and unknown (360).

Bowo, not his real name, is what Indonesians call an ODHA (orang dengan HIV/AIDS, or person suffering from HIV/AIDS)…

The 27-year-old, a former drug addict and prisoner who married last year but has not told his wife or family about his condition, works as a counselor to fellow sufferers at Baliâ€™s Yayasan Matahati, an AIDS group funded by AusAid, in the Batubulan area of Gianyar regency. He shared his day with The Bali Timesâ€™ Arga Sagitarini.

My day begins at 6am, and straight away I get ready for work. I spend most of the day out of the office, going around and searching for other (suspected) ODHAs and trying to convince them to take a HIV test. If they know they are positive, theyâ€™ll be more careful about preventing transmission of the virus.

As for myself, I found out I was HIV positive after being tested while I was in hospital in 2003 with tuberculosis. I only did the test after some counselors there convinced me to do it, but when I got the results I was frustrated because I didnâ€™t know what to do, what was going to happen.

But fortunately, the counselors were always with me and told me I had to live as normal a life as possible, and to work at Yayasan Matahati and share my experiences with others and tell them that the best way to avoid AIDS is to live a healthy life.

After being out all day, I get back home around 5pm â€“ home to my lovely wife. She doesnâ€™t know I have HIV, nor do my family. Iâ€™m not ready to tell them yet. Iâ€™m always careful not to infect my wife when weâ€™re intimate and always use a condom.

I caught HIV when I used a hypodermic needle when I was taking drugs three years ago. Iâ€™d been doing drugs for 10 years, ever since I was in high school. Eventually I was arrested by the police and jailed for one and a half years. Behind bars, I vowed to become a better person, and told myself that even though I have the HIV virus in my body, I could still lead a normal life. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been trying to do.

Before I became infected, I was scared of AIDS, but Iâ€™ve learned itâ€™s not the death sentence people used to think it was. That doesnâ€™t mean there isnâ€™t discrimination in society, though â€“ AIDS still has a bad image and many ODHAs suffer discrimination here.

I do some exercises in the evening to keep healthy; my doctor suggested I do them. Usually I do some jogging and pushups. Around 8:30 we have dinner, and I like to eat healthily â€“ food that has a high nutritional value.

My immune system is actually in good shape, and up to now I havenâ€™t required antiretroviral drugs. I want to stay healthy because once you start taking those drugs, you have to continue with them for the rest of your life.

One day I hope a drug will become available that will wipe out HIV. I want to be free from it, and to have a healthy life with a lot of children.

A drug used to treat genital herpes can also slow progression of the AIDS virus among co-infected patients, doctors reported this week.

Most people infected with HIV are also coincidentally infected with type 2 herpes simplex virus, or HSV2.

Previous lab research has shown that using an anti-HSV2 drug called aciclovir reduces the amount of AIDS virus in the blood.

What was unknown, though, was whether this also had an impact on the spread of HIV in the body.

The answer, according to a study published by The Lancet, is that aciclovir does have a braking effect that is modest but could become a useful option for doctors.

It could buy time before a patient has to be given powerful drugs to combat HIV.

Jairam Lingappa of the University of Washington led a trial in 14 sites in southern and eastern Africa, recruiting 3,381 heterosexual volunteers who were co-infected with HSV2 and HIV-1, the main strain of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.

Half of the group were assigned to aciclovir, taking twice-daily doses of the drug, or to a dummy lookalike pill, and were followed for up to 24 months.

The key question was whether the volunteers’ count of CD4 cells, the immune cells that are destroyed by HIV, fell below 200 per microlitre by the end of the trial.

On this score, aciclovir reduced the risk by 16 percent. Of the volunteers on aciclovir, 284 fell below the 200 CD4 count, whereas the number among the placebo group was 324.

Using another yardstick, the researchers also found that, among volunteers whose immune system was in better shape, aciclovir also reduced by 19 percent the risk of a CD4 count falling below 350 cells per microlitre.

The findings are important, says Lingappa, because they suggest another weapon could be added to the skimpy pharmaceutical armoury for treating HIV.

Recent evidence has shown that people with HIV have a better chance of survival if they are given antiretrovirals at an earlier stage of infection.

As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has revised its guidelines for treating HIV in poor countries.

It recommends that these daily drugs be administered when the CD4 cell count falls to 350 per microlitre, rather than wait for the CD4 tally to hit a lower level, when the immune system can become badly damaged.

These recommendations have a wide-ranging impact, not least because they mean cash-strapped countries have to find extra money to treat people sooner than before.

So a drug that can slow progression towards this mark will ease the strain on health budgets. It would also stave off the time when a patient has to take a treatment that can have toxic side effects.

“While the HIV disease-ameliorating effect we have observed is modest, it could add one more tool to help people with HIV infection stay healthy for longer,” Lingappa said. Further investigation is needed, he added.

GIANYAR

Health authorities in Gianyar say they are seriously concerned at the rising incidence of HIV/AIDS cases in the regency, pointing to new figures that show 129 cases were recorded in 2009, with 18 deaths over the past four years.

They say the widespread availability of casual sex through nightclubs and other entertainment venues, particularly in Ubud, is a major cause of increased risk.

Figures for 2001-2005, the previous statistical period, show there were 16 cases and two deaths.

Gianyar health chief Dewa Made Sutanaya said this week the figures did not mean health authorities had lost control of HIV/AIDS countermeasures. Gathering precise statistics made it possible for preventive health measures to be taken and properly targeted at at-risk populations.

“It is important to know exactly how much of the total population has been affected by the HIV/AIDS virus,” he said. “Even with limited funds, in 2008 we made a big effort in the prevention and mitigation of HIV/AIDS transmission and infection and this was well coordinated with related agencies and the police.”

Sutanaya said the aim was a gradual decline in new HIV/AIDS cases and better management of existing patients.

DENPASAR ~

Governor of Bali Made Mangku Pastika asked the Regents/ Mayor immediately control the café remang-remang (dimly lit) that are more and more prevalent as to be one source of the spread of HIV /AIDS.

“It should be made clear for the Regents in order to control those cafes because I’m sure almost all of them are without license,” he said in Denpasar, on Wednesday.

According to the former police chief of Bali, it is definitely the Regents / Mayor not to issue a permit for the dimly lit cafe. Therefore, there must be a breakthrough so that the spread of HIV /AIDS in Bali not more widely spreading.

“There must be a comprehensive effort, I go back and forth saying that cafes become a place of the disease transmission and must be controlled. The main obstacle, because of the human will and it is hard to deal with,” he said.

On the other hand, he thought that the major spread of the deadly virus in Bali is due to unhealthy sexual relationships and the use of non-sterile needles.

“Especially for syringes usually is started from using drugs. But the case of transmission of HIV /AIDS through blood transfusion is almost none in Bali,” he said.

Earlier, the Head of Department of Health Ketut Suarjaya said that while the official number of people with HIV /AIDS (ODHA) in Bali cumulatively from 1987 to October 2013 is 8,141 people but the actual number is estimated at 26,000 people.

The estimation is based on the result of monitoring the distribution of HIV /AIDS cases in Bali and a survey in 2012 of 2,000 respondents, of which 20 percent were HIV- positive.

He said in an effort to suppress the spread of HIV in Bali, the Bali Provincial Health Department will further maximize the socialization of condom use.

Suarjaya mentioned that in a year provincial government distributes about 80 thousand condoms to the target consisting of commercial sex workers and their clients.

In an effort to maximize the response to HIV /AIDS, Bali provincial government in 2014 will allocate 6 billion and maximize VCT clinics or voluntary HIV testing clinic.

Tuberculosis is an increasing issue in Bali, according to health officials.

Recently released figures for 2010 show a total of 479 people were listed as suffering from the disease in Denpasar. This marked an increase from 418 TB cases recorded in the Bali capital in 2009.

Chairman of the Denpasar branch of The Indonesian Tuberculosis Eradication Organisation (PPTI) I Made Sudhana Satrigraha said that as well as recording increasing cases of the disease, cure rates for TB in Denpasar were still below the national target.

Government targets require a full cure for 70 percent of TB patients whereas doctors in Denpasar are currently managing a rate of just 65 percent, Satrigraha said.

“The low level of recovery is largely due to the fact that patients change addresses frequently, so it is very difficult for health officers to monitor them during the treatment process,” he said.

Satrigraha said compliance with treatment was also a problem. A full six-month course of antibiotics was needed to cure TB, he said, but many patients stopped taking the drugs when they began to feel better after just a few months, leading to relapses.

He added that PPTI was making increasing efforts in the field of public awareness in Denpasar to highlight these issues to potential patients.

Satrigraha said the occurrence of HIV-AIDS exacerbated the threat of TB, and AIDS patients were particularly susceptible to the disease.

“The issue of HIV-AIDS could increase the occurrence of TB, because sufferers’ immune systems have very weak resistance,” he said.

He shared his day with Carla Albertí de la Rosa.

I wake up at 7 in the morning and I think how grateful I am that I’m not addicted to drugs anymore. I used to be addicted to heroin but I stopped seven years ago. I got over drugs thanks to Yayasan Kesehatan and now it’s very pleasing to be part of it. It’s my turn to help people who need it.

I’ve just had a child, who is just 26 days old. She is so perfect and as soon as I get out of bed I go to give her a hug and spend some time with her. I then take a shower and have breakfast. I usually have fried noodles. I read the newspaper for about half an hour and at 8:30 I leave the house to get to work at 9. When I get to my office I check my staff and their plans for the day. We talk about what happened the day before and I give them advice if they have any doubts.

We help people who are addicted to drugs and live with HIV. We give out information about the negative effects of drugs and give moral support to the HIV community. We used to have a rehabilitation centre but since last March we stopped it because many other centres in Bali do it. So we use our place as a drop-in centre. If they want a place to hang out or to sleep for a few weeks we can help.

For people who are addicted to drugs we give them cognitive behaviour therapy. It’s basically trying to change their perspective about life and the way they think about drugs. People who are addicted to drugs see their life as being ruled by drugs, so we try to change that perspective. Drugs have become a big problem in Bali. Most drug users are between 17 to 40 and they have a lot of amphetamine, which is crystal ice; we also have a lot of ecstasy, heroin and marijuana. Drugs became popular in the 90s, with the tourism boom.

I have lunch around 1, some babi guling (roasted sucking pig) that I buy at the foodstall next door, or some fried rice. After lunch I check my schedule. We get our money from the government and I have a lot of connections with the government so sometimes we organise workshops to help people.

We give people living with HIV some counselling. They might come into my office and I give them information and try to make them understand that their life has not stopped just because they have HIV. Life keeps going.

The Health Department says we have 3,400 people with HIV on the island but the real estimate is around 7,000 people. We have a lot of HIV cases from sharing syringes. We used to give free syringes but now they are given by the public health service. The problem is now people with HIV have had babies and they have contracted the disease. There aren’t enough safe-sex education campaigns in Indonesia and the use of condoms in Bali is very low. Advertising is very expensive and we don’t have the money to do it. We give free condoms only in Tabanan and other organisations do it in other areas of Bali. In general people are not aware of the risks of not using protection. It’s strange for the Balinese people to buy condoms; it’s not in their culture to do it.

Drug regulations in Indonesia are very strict. If someone is caught taking them, the minimum sentence is four years. So I spend a lot of time pushing the government to send the drug users to rehabilitation instead of punishing them.

In the afternoon I check my emails and make programs for education for the community. I train staff and make sure that everything is working smoothly.

Right before I finish work, around 8pm, we have an informal discussion, with staff and ex-drug users about what we have achieved and what else can we do to improve things.

I then go home and spend time with my daughter and my wife. I like watching action movies and dramas. I always watch them in English and that’s why my English has improved over the years. When I have spare time I do some gardening in my house and clean the aquarium for my fish. I lie down in bed and read for a few minutes, mainly autobiographies, until I fall asleep around midnight.

MANILA ~ Indonesia’s construction boom is driving an “exponential” rise in HIV-AIDS infections as migrant workers are more likely to engage in high-risk sex, the Asian Development Bank warned Tuesday.

The Manila-based ADB said the spread of HIV-AIDS could kill up to 100,000 Indonesians within two years.

“As in other parts of the world, the three Ms – men, mobility and money – are key ingredients for the spread of HIV,” the bank said in a statement after approving a grant to help the government tackle the problem.

It singled out the construction industry, which grew nine percent last year and accounts for five percent of the labor force and 8.4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.

“As Indonesia addresses its backlog of investment needs and meets new growth-generated demand, the sector will remain strong” and “mobile construction workers away from home are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior than the general population,” the bank said.

The bank said cases of HIV that causes AIDS had “been increasing exponentially” since 2000 in Indonesia, where it said the Health Ministry estimated 220,000 people of working age were living with HIV or AIDS last year.

Another 8.2 million people were “at high risk.”

“By 2010, the number of people with HIV and AIDS is projected to reach 400,000 and it is expected that 100,000 will have died of AIDS,” it said.

HIV-AIDS has now spread to all but one of the country’s 33 provinces and sex workers were overtaking injecting drug users as the ones most at risk, it added.

The ADB said it had approved a US$200,000 technical assistance grant to help the government “mitigate the risk of HIV associated with infrastructure development.”

The ADB grant will help Indonesia develop an HIV prevention strategy for the construction sector, including educating construction workers on safe sex.

With interviews by Laurane Marchive

The Bali Times

LEGIAN ~ “You’ve got a big one,” the woman says as she sidles up to a Bali Times reporter, pointing to the outsized screen on a BlackBerry-type device he was reading a message on. “Want to have sex?” The reporter, in timeless tabloid fashion, made his excuses and left.

Sex permeates Bali’s tourism industry, nowhere more so than in the frenetic Legian strip that pulsates 24/7. And for many young people who come to Bali for a fleeting holiday, having a fling is top of their activity list.

A manager at one of Legian’s newest nightclubs told this newspaper that as glitzy new premises had sprung up in recent years, there had been an incremental match in the influx of sex workers to the area.

“Some nights there are so many of them, even rent boys walking the street and trying to entice Westerners driving by, leaning in to their windows. You didn’t see that before,” she said.

And there’s a new entry to the Bali sex scene: Russian prostitutes, and girls from Eastern Europe, who can command far more from clients than locals, said the manager.

At a nearby, tiny bar that proffers explicitly described cocktails, almost claustrophobic with its narrowness and faux-tropical décor, middle-aged foreign men drink the local brew Bintang as signs advertise the availability of Viagra and what it calls a “better” herbal alternative, “Nangen,” which overseas media reports say has caused deaths and hospitalization of men who have taken it.

Elsewhere around Kuta, clandestine strip clubs abound, but only those in the know can get in.

In a country where many struggle to make at least Rp1 million (US$91) a month, sex work can offer tantalizing rewards. Yuli is from Java and has been working as a prostitute in the Legian area for the past two years. The 29-year-old says she can make up to Rp12 million a month, mostly from an Australian customer base that “gives good tips.”

She tells The Bali Times she’s mindful of sexually transmitted diseases and will not have intercourse with a customer unless he uses a condom. She charges Rp300,000 for one-off sex, Rp1 million to spend the night with her (Rp800,000 for regulars), and says she works at a laundry during the day and that her family back home has no idea what she does at night; neither do her friends.

“To begin with, they offer me drinks. They don’t want to only have sex; they also want to talk,” says Yuli of her clients.

“Some customers just want a massage, or just want hugs and kisses,” she said, adding that the hazards of the job are violent customers and those that try to wangle out of paying – so she asks for payment up front, or no service.

“Sometimes I’m scared to go with a man, because he looks strange, but I have to go,” she says.

While prostitution is illegal in Indonesia, it is viewed by police and judges as a minor transgression, and those arrested are often charged just a fine of around Rp250,000 and if they cannot pay are held for 10 days, a state prosecutor told The Times. The penal code holds lengthy prison terms for those convicted of organizing prostitution rings, of up to 15 years, as well as for child-sex or trafficking.

There are at least 230,000 prostitutes in Indonesia – some estimates put that figure at double the number – on average earning $600 a month, according to estimates from organizations such as the International Labor Organization, a UN body.

But despite the authorities’ lax view of working girls, many are fearful of being picked up by police, some of whom may be playing their own game.

“Sometimes I am afraid to go with a customer and to find the police waiting for me when it’s over. They ask me for money then. Even if I give them my ID, they only want money,” said Yuli.

She’s also anxious they might lock her up, if they catch her during her working hours from midnight to 4am.

But while Yuli’s life is now focused on sex work during the small hours of the morning, she has her sights set on the future and manages to save about half what she earns.

“In three or four years, I hope to stop (sex work), when I have enough money, and go back to Java. In a month I spend between Rp5 million and Rp7 million and I put the rest in the bank,” she said.

It’s not an easy life, being a prostitute, though, and for Yuli, who’s single, she is haunted by bouts of sadness and occasional revulsion at men she reluctantly has sex with but the economic pressure is overwhelming and the constant driver.

“Sometimes I feel bad about doing this, but what can I do? I have to do it to live. Even if a customer is ugly, I have to be nice to him. Sometimes they disgust me, but I don’t say anything, don’t show it.

“I am not happy. It’s quiet now, and I’m even less happy.”

Yuli said that since September, she had had few customers, frequently only three a week, but that there was a lot of competition. At one nightclub she frequents, she says there are as many as 300 prostitutes looking for clients every night.

“There’s around 300 girls working in [name withheld] like me – inside, in front, upstairs. It’s easy money, but sometimes I don’t feel good. I worry about diseases – AIDS, kissing diseases. But I don t select customers; I just take what comes.

“Sometimes I have regular customers, who come back every six months. Sometimes customers want to keep in touch; sometimes they book me for a week to go sightseeing, enjoy their holidays, go to restaurants, travel around Bali.

“Most of them don’t only want sex; they want to be happy. Sometimes they want to have a relationship with me, but without paying. Some are not nice to me. Now people are even less happy.”

For fellow Javan Lea, 26, a night on the job means sex with between two and four men. She said most of her customers were Australians, none Indonesian.

While working as a prostitute means big earnings for the single mother of one, she would rather do something else to make ends meet.

“I don’t like this work but I need the money to raise my daughter, who’s with my mother in Java. This is the only work I do. I’m happy with my life, not with my work.”

She said she told her family she was working at a supermarket in Bali and had no idea how long she would continue as a prostitute.

“I don’t know when I will stop doing this work,” she said.

If the heterosexual sex industry in Bali is thriving, so to is its gay counterpart. At one bar on the Seminyak-area Jl. Dyana Pura, known for its gay bars and clubs, the entire staff, including the barmen, are up for hire, an expatriate resident who frequents the establishments told The Times.

“Monica” is a 24-year-old Balinese ladyboy who started sleeping with men for money when he was an 18-year-old high school student, and counts among his clientele at a bar on that street “lots of Australians, Europeans and Japanese.”

“I have a boyfriend; he’s straight,” he said. “I dress like a woman all the time; my boyfriend likes it. People around me are ok with it; they respect me. I take hormones to look like a woman.”

Monica said he charges men Rp1 million to have sex with him, and up to Rp2 million for an all-night stay. From Thursday to Sunday are his busiest nights, he says, adding that he started dressing in female clothes when he was aged five and later in life took part in drag-queen competitions.

“I just follow my life. If I can find a Western boyfriend, I will follow him. I hope one day my dream will come true.

“When a customer likes me, he tries to seduce me first, and then takes me to his house. We have sex. I keep up relations via the internet with some guys from Germany, with old customers. Sometimes my boyfriend is jealous.

“I do this for money. I keep all the money for myself,” he said, revealing that many clients are married men with children, with “a lot of tourists and sometimes expatriates.”

“I select them, and if they don’t please me, I say no. We always use condoms,” said Monica, who also sets up appointments at clients’ homes, hotels or apartments.

“We talk a lot before having sex, have a lot of drinks. I just take one customer per night. Some ‘girls’ can have three of four. Sometimes I enjoy it; sometimes I don’t; but even then, I still do it for the money.

“I try to give them a good service. Sometimes clients become our boyfriend for a week, and then it’s about being a good couple for a while.

“We have a working license; the government knows what we do.

Somebody protects us if we are in trouble – people from the bar, or the police. We are not doing anything bad. Some clients want to do it without a condom, but we always say no.”

Eric, 23, entered the gay prostitution scene in October this year, and says he has a maximum of two clients per night, always Westerners. He said he left his native Kalimantan, on Borneo island, to come to Bali expressly to earn money through prostitution.

“I am pretty new here, as I started working on October 20 this year, three days after I arrived. I came especially to do this work.

“Most of the time I approach the Western guys and they offer me a drink and I go to their place and have sex with them. The following morning they give me ‘taxi money’” of around Rp500,000.

Eric said he currently has a client from Holland staying in Bali and he was paying for the room he rents at a local boarding house.

“I haven’t had trouble with customers; they never hurt me,” he said. “Sometimes I have regular clients. Two of them are from Holland. But it’s all for the money.”

That cash, he said, was going towards his education in his home village, and that if his family had enough money, he would not have been forced into prostituting himself. But in the end, he said, the choice was his, even if he often didn’t always like what he was doing.

“There’s nobody pushing me to do this work. It’s my choice, even if I don’t really have a choice.”

If you listen carefully, you can almost hear the drum roll! Jupiter, towards the end of June, moves from Gemini to Cancer. That marks a big turning point, not just for people born under these signs or even for Pisceans and Sagittarians (the two signs ruled by Jupiter) but for us all. Jupiter only changes sign once a year or so. The collective mood shifts, almost instantly. My medieval predecessors believed that Jupiter was ‘exalted’ in Cancer and that all the traditional Cancerian values (compassion, empathy and sensitivity) would begin to become more prevalent in society as a whole.

ARIES (March 21 – April 20)

It’s strange how easily we get used to aspects of our environment. If we live in the city, we stop noticing traffic noise. If we live by the sea, we hardly detect the smell of the spray. Only after time away do we recognise what we have been dealing with. It’s the same with people whose behaviour amazes others yet who we know so well that it all just becomes no more (or less) than what we expect. You are now becoming aware of something you’ve long been overlooking. June brings your chance to instigate lasting change.

TAURUS (April 21 – May 21)

Do you think you may be responsible for strife in your situation? Why might you be to blame? Have you not behaved with impeccable integrity under a set of difficult circumstances? If you’ve got faults and foibles, can we really say they are worse than anyone else’s? The question, this month, is not ‘What have you done?’ but ‘What can you do?’ You’re about to find yourself in a fine position to right wrongs, regardless of who caused them or how they came about. Don’t blame yourself or anyone else. Just get busy.

GEMINI (May 22 – June 22)

You have done well recently even though you have had to face some challenging issues and stressful situations. You are not entirely out of trouble – but you are definitely heading towards safer territory with each sensible step that you now take. Remember, in June, to celebrate and trust whatever inspires you the most. Count your blessings and celebrate your successes. Although a problem has drained a lot of your energy, you will soon find life helps you get it all back – and a little more besides.

CANCER (June 23 – July 23)

You are no longer sure how sure you are… about something you once felt totally sure of! You are seriously contemplating a commitment, reassessing your level of motivation and dedication to a goal that it was previously a high priority to attain. It’s not that you are losing interest, just that your level of interest is altering. It was fed, in the past, by a limited idea of what might be possible for you. Now you’re seeing broader horizons. That’s giving you the courage to change much, for the better, in June.

LEO (July 24 – August 23)

You don’t need to feel vulnerable. You can afford to relax and let June bring much-needed comfort. Indeed, you can’t afford not to let go of a key concern. The more you hang on to it, the harder it will be to take a practical, constructive step. There is really nothing to fear. Give life a chance to surprise you. You will soon be able to alter many plans. Which changes should you be most enthusiastic about implementing? The first to go can be the ones you care least about. What’s essential is just that you decide what’s essential!

VIRGO (August 24 – September 23)

Cartoon characters are often depicted with the power to move at many times the speed of normal people. They can see a maniac planning to take over the world, then race off and foil their plans and be home for tea. Psychologically you now seem to have a similar ability. You can see what’s wrong and how to fix it. What you can’t see yet, though, is how to persuade someone else to take the appropriate action – and circumstances don’t permit you to do it yourself. Don’t grow impatient in June. Just give that person a chance!

LIBRA (September 24 – October 23)

In June, somehow, you have to accept what you cannot change and change what you cannot accept. This advice is easy to give and hard to take but it sums up the approach you require. How are you supposed to know what you can and can’t change? Try to alter your situation. If it works, be glad. If not, resolve to live with as much of it as you can. Then take the remaining portion and look for some way to adjust that. The only option may not be your favourite but if it is the only way, it must be taken and trusted.

SCORPIO (October 24 – November 22)

It doesn’t matter how much air you put into a balloon, if there’s a hole at the other end, it will all come right back out again. Even if the balloon is in perfect condition, it won’t hold its content forever. And if you put in too much, it will explode. Then there’s the whole business of knot-tying. What an art. What a complicated balancing act. Yet we take it for granted once we know what we are dealing with. You are on a learning curve in June, but you are nearly at the bit in the process where everything starts to come naturally.

For a SIX-MONTH prediction filled with potential for positive change, call 0906-751 8080.

SAGITTARIUS (November 23 – December 21)

Since the dawn of time, people have dreamed about the ability to fly. We have developed mythologies about creatures that are half-human, half-bird. We humans have never, though, taken to the air. Well, not before 1783 that is. The first manned hot-air balloon went up then – and thousands of years of certainty were overturned in the process. And with that, we turn to the only question that need really concern you in June: What’s impossible? The only honest answer is nothing. Can you fly now? Yes! And not just in your heart!

CAPRICORN (December 22 – January 20)

You’ve got a sharp implement. An opportunity to work wonders or wreak havoc. I hope you know what I mean by this. If not, please re-read. Few things in this world are as dangerous as the people who have great power at their disposal yet who will not use it because they do not believe they have it. Or worse, those who go ahead and use it without understanding quite what an impact it can have. You don’t need to employ great energy to get what you need in June. Just take careful aim. That will do the trick.

AQUARIUS (January 21 – February 19)

You don’t really need to go looking for clues. You just need to think about what you can already see. A picture is slowly starting to form. It will become much clearer if you stop squinting. You want things to be a particular way. So deep is your desire for a dream to come true that you are willing to overlook a hundred signs, signals and suggestions to the contrary. Put aside your prejudice. Be truly willing to recognise reality, even if it conflicts with your preferred vision. You can’t lose out in June – unless you lie to yourself.

PISCES (February 20 – March 20)

It is now as if you are looking at a daunting obstacle, only to realise that it is not so daunting after all. Perhaps you have been bracing yourself for a collision with something solid. Now, as you get nearer to it, you realise two things: that you cannot stop in time… and that this doesn’t matter. The brick wall is, in fact, just a painting of a brick wall on a large but thin sheet of paper that has been stretched across the road. You can burst right through it in June. And you can improve your whole future from here on in!

DENPASAR ~

Governor of Bali,Made Mangku Pastika, encouraged people on the island to dare rejecting the existence of several places alleged as being localization as one of the effective effort to control the spread of HIV/ AIDS.

“So far the issue of HIV/ AIDS has yet to be fully addressed and the effort to look for way out should be continued,” he said after delivering Bali Province Report on Accountability Note of 2013 at DPRD Bali, in Denpasar.

According to him, the problem of HIV/ AIDS in Bali cannot be merely associated with the fact that the island is a tourist area, but it needs the society awareness as they all already know that it is transmitted through sexual contact, so it should be avoided.

More than 20 percent of commercial sex workers in Bali have HIV/AIDS, and higher number might be there out of the data exist at the government.

“The problem is that the mindfulness is in us. People must dare to refuse because surely they know of its existence,” said Pastika.

Pastika judged that the effective way to address the spread of HIV/ AIDS due to the existence of places alleged as localization and cafés makes the operation hard, rejection from the society and consumer also should refrain.

“If nobody buys, nobody would want selling. In the law of market, the more customers are, so the more the sales,” he said.

On the other hand, Bali provincial government has also sought various anticipatory efforts such as to improve socialization in a sustainable manner to reach all levels of society and enhance cooperation with NGOs concerned with AIDS.

MENGWI

Badung public order police (Satpol) arrested seven women suspected of working as prostitutes — and one “dirty couple” caught in the act — in a surprise raid on the Pondok Putri Bali (Princess Cottage Bali) at Penarungan, Mengwi.

The midnight raid last Friday brought the well-known and apparently popular assignation place to a halt. Satpol officers said three of the women arrested were married and another was a school-age girl from Malang, East Java.

Meanwhile Governor I Made Mangku Pastika has repeated his call for Satpol to close cafés – often along highways – that are fronts for prostitution.

He used an address at an anniversary ceremony for the Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) to reiterate the need for urgent action.

“Now let me remind you once again, those cafés have no legal permit, so why let them exist? Are you brave enough and have the courage to close them or not? Me, I’m serious; I mean it,” he told the provincial, district, and city personal of Satpol PP.

Pastika said he realised there were problems for Satpol officers in the field. “There must be powerful persons or institutions behind those illegal cafés, otherwise they wouldn’t dare to even open. But that’s your challenge. Just tell them that this is the Governor’s command.”

The governor also cited the HIV/AIDS consequences of illicit sex establishments. He said 4,000 sex workers in Bali were already listed as infected with HIV/AIDS.

Many developing countries including Indonesia have just less than three years to make significant progresses in poverty eradication, health, sanitation and education programs which are parts of the the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

April 5, 2013 will mark 1,000 days to the end of 2015 – the deadline for achieving the eight MDGs which were agreed by UN member nations in September 2000.

The eight goals that have to be achieved by 2015 are: Eradication of Extreme Poverty and Starvation; Achieving Universal Primary Education; Promotion of Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women; Reducing Child Mortality; Improvement of Maternal Health; Combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Other Infectious Diseases; Ensuring Sustainable Environment; and Developing a Global Partnership for Development.

The Indonesian government has claimed that the nation has achieved at least three of the eight goals and even could exceed some targets by 2015.

Since 1990, Indonesia has been able to reduce the number of people living in poverty, from 20.6 percent in 1990 to 11.9 percent in 2012, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told the press after chairing the fourth meeting of the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, in Nusa Dua, Bali, on March 27, 2013 .

The country has achieved universal primary education for children by implementing the 9-year compulsory education policy. Infant mortality has been reduced from 68 per 1,000 births in 1991, to 34 in 2007, the head of state added.

However, Indonesia has to work harder to achieve some other goals, particularly those concerning the poverty eradication, the maternal and infant mortality rate reduction and combating the HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other infectious diseases.

Yudhoyono has expressed his optimism that the country would be able to achieve the MDGs by 2015. “We still have 2.5 years to catch up . We must focus on achieving the goals,” he said.

DENPASAR

A senior politician has blamed the proliferation of cafes – late-night drinking venues which often double as venues for prostitution – for an increase in HIV cases in Bali.

Ketut Kariyasa Adnyana, deputy head of the Bali regional assembly, said cafes, which are popular with many local men, and have been associated with drugs and violent crime, were now spreading into even remote rural areas of Bali.

“Cafes have spread into remote villages on the island. The condition is worrying because of the high spread of HIV and AIDS. Many of the victims are housewives who got infected from their husbands,” he said.

Another assembly member, Made Arjaya, said the cafes were usually hubs for prostitution, with many “waitresses” doubling as commercial sex workers.

“Data shows that 1,000 commercial sex workers in Bali have been infected by HIV and AIDS,” Arjaya said, adding that many of them were ostensibly employed as waitresses in cafes, rather than openly working as prostitutes in brothels.

Arjaya said that local governments should continue with their policy of closing down cafes.

However, Adnyana called for the establishment of localised tolerance zones where prostitution could more readily be managed and monitored by the authorities.

“If cafes are spread in many places, there are even some in residential areas, it is hard to observe them. Centralising the location will make it easier to supervise and control the threat of the disease,” he said.

Utami Dwi Suryadi, another assembly member, called on Balinese men to consider the impact of using prostitutes at such cafes.

“If the husband spreads the disease to the wives, who will suffer? The children might lose their parents and even their future,” she said.

Recognized or not, people often forget, because it has its limitations. Because they often have forgotten it, then every year on sasih kepitu (the seventh month according to the Balinese calendar), held a ceremony at the core of Shiva Ratri celebrations pejagraan night. Pejagraan whose origin he jagra it means conscious, aware or literate. People are always jagralah to avoid sin.

In the Bhagavadgita III, 42, otherwise, people will have clear minds, if atman or soul holy always shone budhi or consciousness. Budhi (consciousness) is controlled manas (mind). Manah master the senses. The structural condition of the mind and is ideal as it is very difficult to obtain. He must always be pursued with the belief in God as the repellent darkness of the soul. Shiva Ratri (Ratri is also often written Latri) is a night to focus on Trance Shiva to get awareness to avoid dark thoughts. Therefore, Shiva Ratri more accurately called “awareness night” or “night pejagraan”, not “night of atonement” as commonly understood by those who are not steeped in religion.

Indeed, people are always aware of the nature of life, always avoid sin. People can have awareness, because the power budhinya (which became one of the elements of mind) called citta. Doing brata Shiva Ratri budhi essentially reinforce elements. By focusing on strengths and budhi the sanctity of Shiva as an aspect or manifestation of Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa, we fused the darkness that hinders budhi and receive God’s holy light. If budhi always gets the holy God, then budhi will strengthen the mind or manas, so it can control the senses or Tri Guna.

Shiva Ratri essentially Namasmaranâm activity at Siwa. Namasmaranâm means to always remember and praise the name of God that if dihubungankan with Shiva Ratri is the name of Shiva. Major Shiva has the power to destroy all ignorance. If it gets light from the darkness Hyang Siwa, it gives birth to the much-needed awareness budhi every moment in life. Thus, Shiva Ratri ceremony did not actually have to be done every year, but can be carried out once a month, ie every tilem or months before death. Whereas before tilem kepitu (tilem the darkest) held a ceremony called Maha Shiva Ratri.

In order to achieve consciousness, we can purify ourselves by doing pythons. In Lontar Wraspati Tattwa mentioned, pythons ngaranya netya majapa maradina sarira. Sanca it means to do japa and cleanse the body. Medium Sarasamuscaya book mentions, Dhyana ngaranya Ikang Siwasmarana, meaning, dhyana name (if) always remember Hyang Siwa.

In India, every die before the month (every month) Hindu Shiva Ratri and held each year to celebrate Maha Shiva Ratri. Virtue brata Shiva Ratri lot described in Sanskrit literature, ancient Javanese and Balinese. It’s a sign, that the wa Shiva Ratri from long ago was celebrated by both the Hindus in India, and in Java and Bali. In Sanskrit literature, the primacy of Shiva Ratri brata kitabkitab described in the Puranas, such as Shiva Purana, Skanda Purana, Garuda Purana and Padma Purana. Shiva Purana, at the Jnana Samhita describes Shiva Ratri brata virtue and know-how to celebrate the holy night terbut. There was a load of dialogue between man named Suta and the AEC. In conversation, a cruel man named dikisahkanl Rurudruha. He became aware of the sins that have been done after brata Shiva Ratri. Thanks to the rise of consciousness, he left all sin, then steadily walk the path of dharma.





Among the various brata, visiting holy places, giving the fund has a high like precious stones (gold and diamonds), perform various types of yajna ceremony, various types of tapa and perform various activities Japa or mantra to worship his majesty, it’s all nothing brata virtue exceeds Sivaratri.

In line with the above statement, stating the primacy kakawin Sivaratri Kalpa Brata Sivaratri as diwedarkan by Sang Hyang Shiva as follows:

“Once someone is able to perform as Brata which I have taught, kalahlah reward of all Yajna ceremony, do penance and funds have likewise purify themselves to the holy places, in the early incarnation, even though a thousand million times enjoyed Pataka (the reward of sin and papa ), but the reward is Brata Sivaratri, all Pataka disappeared “.

“Although it is really very bad, did the dirty deed, hurting the kindness of others, kill priests (holy men) are also killing innocent people, arrogant and disrespectful to teachers, killing babies in the womb, all that poverty will disappear by doing Brata Sivaratri major, so virtue and height Brata (Sivaratri) that I sabdakan this “(Sivaratri kalpa, 37, 7-8) *

Literary sources itihasa In Itihasa, Sivaratri found in the Mahabharata, Santi Parva ie, in the episode when Bhishma was lying on arrows Arjuna children, waiting for death, while discussing the dharma, referring to the celebration of Maha Sivaratri by Citrabhanu king, king of the dynasty Jambudvipa Iksvaku. Citrabhanu King and his wife did on the day of Maha Sivaratri upavasa. Rsi Astavakra asked:

“O king, why are you two doing upavasa today? The king was awarded the memory of punarbhawa before, and he explained to the AEC.

“In a previous life I was a hunter in Varanasi named Susvara. Habit was to kill and sell birds and other animals. One day I hunt the woods, I caught a deer, but the days dark trigger. I can not go home, I tied deer in a tree. Then I climbed a tree bilva. For I was hungry and thirsty, I could not sleep. I thought of my poor wife children at home, waiting to go home with a sense of hungry and restless. To pass the night I plucked leaves bilva and dropped to the ground. “Next story similar to the story Lubdaka in Indonesia.

Sivaratri is also contained in the purana-purana, which generally contains stories conscious hunters, as follows:

First, the Siva Purana (section Jnanasamhita). This section contains a conversation between Suta with rsi, outlining the importance of Sivaratri ceremony. Someone named Rurudruha as mentioned above.

Second, the Skanda Purana (section Kedarakanda). On the Kedarakanda among others contains a conversation between Lomasa with the AEC. Lomasa told the AEC on the Canda evil, murderers of all beings, to kill Brahmins, finally able to understand and appreciate the so-called “truth” In the Skanda Purana also told the story of a hunter who is identical to the story of the hunter in the Santi Parva.

Third, the Garuda Purana (section Acarakanda). This section contains a brief description of Sivaratri told that Parvati asked about brata paramount. Siva Sivaratri describes the implementation vrata. A king named Sudarasenaka go hunting into the woods with a dog. The series even this story is not different from the story above hunters.

Fourth, the Padma Purana (section Uttarakanda). This section contains the king Dilipa denganWasista conversation.

West Australians are continuing to pick up nasty infectious diseases in Bali, with new figures showing increases in the number of sexually transmitted infections and mosquito-borne diseases brought back from the popular holiday island.

Health Department figures reveal 46 percent of the 3000 West Australians who returned from overseas with infectious diseases last year had been to Indonesia – almost all to Bali.

Some 117 people returned from Indonesia with chlamydia – 37 more than in 2011 – and 56 with gonorrhoea, up 16.

There were 421 cases of dengue fever, 262 cases of salmonella gastroenteritis and 161 cases of campylobacter gastroenteritis. The number of West Australians needing post-exposure vaccinations as a precaution against rabies after being bitten or scratched by monkeys, dogs or other animals was up 14 on 2011, with 157 cases.

Department medical epidemiologist Gary Dowse said other significant infectious diseases picked up in Bali last year included HIV, malaria, legionnaires’ disease, typhus, typhoid fever, hepatitis A and the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus.

Australian Medical Association WA president Richard Choong, who last year called on the Federal Government to help lift health and hygiene standards in Bali, said it was disappointing nothing had been done.

The official opening of over-water toll road (JDP) connecting Benoa-Ngurah Rai Airport-Nusa Dua will be done at the same time of celebrating the 55th anniversary of Bali Provincial government on August 14, 2013.

The governor of Bali Made mangku Pastika in Denpasar stated that for the plan he had sent letter to the President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono so he could open JDP officially on the scheduled time. “I hope that the President of Indonesia could open JDP and announce its name,” he said.

He stated that he had sent two options of JDP name to the President, Jalan Soekarno-hatta and Jalan Bali Mandara.

According to the former Chief of Bali Police, Jalan Soekarno Hatta is given to commemorate the service of those two Indonesian pro claimers as the nation has stood up until now because of their effort.

While the name Jalan Bali Mandara, he said, besides it’s the President’s idea, it also has special meaning to Bali. “Bali Mandara sticks to Balinese name, all people in the world will know Bali and it exists in Bali. Mandara means great, huge and holy,” he said.

He had submitted two options of the road name to the President SBY to decide it, regarding that for national road, the name is decided by the central government.

On the other hand, Pastika said that what is not discussed yet is the JDP rate for two-wheels and four-wheels or more vehicles. “In terms of its rate, it will be a discussion in the legislative as it must be approved by legislators,” he said.

JDP or toll bridge of 12.7 kilometers long prepared for supporting the 2013 Asia Pasific Nations Economy Cooperation (APEC) Summit costs Rp 2.4 trillions.

The project that should be undertaken in 18 months could be finished in 14 months. In Indonesia, JDP is the longest over-water road built by local workers.

Meanwhile, Regional Repre-sentatives Council expects the tariffs of above sea waterstoll connecting Benoa-NgurahRai-Nusa Dua, Bali, is affordable to local community.

“I expect the rate is more favorable to local communities,” said the Council member, Vivi Effendi, on the sidelines of reviewing the road construction projects on the waters of the sea in Denpasar.

Meanwhile, Director of Engineering and Operational Jasa Marga Bali Tol, Wiwin Kwintadi Suprapto, explained that the temporary rates of toll road contracted with the government for units of passenger vehicles such as sedans and jeeps is Rp10 thousand and Rp4 thousand for motorcycles.

“That’s just a temporary rate, but the test can be done later,” he said.

DPD members from Bali, Kadek Arimbawa stated that the temporary rate is expected to be accepted by society as it’s cheaper. But the senator who is familiarly called Lolak expected that there is cross-subsidy between classes of drivers and motorcycle rider. “I think the price is reasonable and cheaper,” he said.

Jasa Marga is also expected to improve their assistance in the form of corporate social responsibility in its attention to the preservation of the environment around such as the preservation of mangroves forest adjacent to the highway project.

Group of Committee II DPD who are in charge of infrastructure, natural resources and other economic resources seemed amazed by the construction of the first toll road in Indonesia, which was built above the sea.

“I am very impressed with the construction of this highway, especially the contractors are Indonesian,” said Bambang Susilo, a DPD member from the constituency of East Kalimantan.

Construction of the 12-kilometer highway that cut through the Badung Strait with views of the mangroves was done by three contractors in the country, namely PT Adhi Karya, PT Hutama Karya, and PT Waskita Karya.

The project built by Indonesian contractors is still under construction that will be unveiled prior to the Summit of Asia Pacific Countries Economic Cooperation (APEC summit) in October.",{},"['bali', 'president', 'times', 'temporary', 'toll', 'summit', 'jalan', 'jdp', 'construction', 'rate', 'road']","DENPASARThe official opening of over-water toll road (JDP) connecting Benoa-Ngurah Rai Airport-Nusa Dua will be done at the same time of celebrating the 55th anniversary of Bali Provincial government on August 14, 2013.

DENPASAR ~

Condom becomes the most wanted thing in Bali. Moreover, people using condom increase to 50 percent compared to 2012.

The Head of Health department Bali province Ketut Suarjaya explained that the data conveys the use of condom in Bali increase to 50 percent.

The condom users, said Suarjaya, commonly are people doing free-sex. Only a few condom users are husband and wife.

According to him, sexual activities before marriage or free sex happens more in Bali.

“On the other hand, the increase number of condom use in Bali means people awareness to use condom increase too. It brings positive impact as it can decrease the cases of various sexual transmitted disease such as HIV/ AIDS that cause death,” said Suarjaya in Denpasar, Monday.

He expected that in the future access to condom is easier and cheaper but still maintaining the quality.

“It doesn’t mean that we want to make free-sex legal or encourage any prostitution but we only want to minimize disease transmission especially sexual disease that is closely related to free-sex,” he explained.

Suarjaya emphasized that character building for young generation in Bali is still minimal. According to him, the responsibility of character or behavior building is a moral responsibility from parents, teachers, religious figures, community figures and surrounding environment.

“This is what we call early education. And in Bali, early education is failed as there are many violated behaviors happened to Balinese young generation,” he emphasized.

The failure of character building in early level, Suarjaya said further, is one of causes of increasing condom use in Bali.

Therefore, he admitted that he fully supports the effort of the Chair of KPAI (Indonesia Children Protection Commission) Bali I Ketut Sudikerta who is also Vice Governor of Bali who has openly asked KPAI Bali and KPAI in regencies and city to be more focus on the case of HIV AIDS transmission.

Sudikerta, according to Suarjaya, had asked specific plan with specific budget allocation too.

The specific budget allocation will be included in the 2014 budget, which is Rp6 billions.

“Previously there is no specific budget for eradicating HIV AIDS. The budget given through Health Department is very minimal and the Health department only get Rp 500 millions. Meanwhile, KPAI Bali only get Rp 500 millions allocation. This is a commitment of the Vice Governor of Bali to eradicate HIV AIDS in Bali,” he explained.

JAKARTA ~ The government and the UN children’s agency signed off on a new agreement this week aimed at raising the living standards of children throughout the archipelago, UNICEF’s Indonesia representative said.

The US$125-million agreement will encompass a range of projects to tackle mother and child health and education in 2008, Gianfranco Rotigliano said.

A focus of next year’s efforts would be promoting proper sanitation for children “which means advocacy and behavior change for children to wash their hands and putting taps into schools,” Rotigliano said.

The annual work plan is to also include construction of 130 new schools in Aceh province, the area worst hit by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, he said.

UNICEF also secured Indonesian government agreement for HIV/AIDS prevention and education, particularly in the eastern Papua region, where the disease is most widespread, UNICEF spokeswoman Kendartanti Subroto said.

Indonesia has had mixed progress in recent years in improving the lives of its children.

While infant mortality has dropped significantly to 30 deaths per 1,000 live births, there has been little or no improvement in rates of malnutrition, maternal mortality or access to safe water, UNICEF said in a statement.

The “Hobbit” actor Ian McKellen said in an interview published that he had had prostate cancer for the last six or seven years, but added that the disease was not life-threatening.

McKellen (73) played Gandalf in the hit “Lord of the Rings” movie trilogy, and reprises the role in three prequels based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s novel “The Hobbit”.

The first of those, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey”, recently had its world premiere in New Zealand, where it was shot under the directorship of Peter Jackson.

“I’ve had prostate cancer for six or seven years,” McKellen told the Daily Mirror tabloid. “When you have got it you monitor it and you have to be careful it doesn’t spread. But if it is contained in the prostate it’s no big deal.”

His representatives in London were not immediately available to comment on the interview.

“Many, many men die from it but it’s one of the cancers that is totally treatable,” added McKellen, one of Britain’s most respected actors who is also well known in Hollywood for appearances in the X-Men franchise.

“I am examined regularly and it’s just contained, it’s not spreading. I’ve not had any treatment.”

He admitted he feared the worst when he heard he had the disease.

“You do gulp when you hear the news. It’s like when you go for an HIV test, you go ‘arghhh is this the end of the road?’”

“I have heard of people dying from prostate cancer, and they are the unlucky ones, the people who didn’t know they had got it and it went on the rampage. But at my age if it is diagnosed its not life threatening.”

“The Hobbit” opens in cinemas later this week.

NUSA DUA ~

The 16th Nusa Dua Fiesta (NDF) will feature a variety of Balinese arts and culture, national and international musicians will present as well at the event held on the island of Peninsula, Nusa Dua, on 15 to 19 November 2013.

“This annual event will present local arts and international music, we annually have excavation of high quality art that is displayed in NDF, “said Chairman of the 16th NDF Organizing Committee, Ida Bagus Abdhi in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Wednesday.

Abdhi further said that this year’s NDF theme was “Wane Lelanguan” or the preservation of the beauty of the forest. With this theme, it is expected to recall the importance of forest conservation to support sustainable tourism.

“The theme of this event is very important for us, because human life cannot be separated from the surrounding environment, including forest environment in the upstream,” he said.

In this activity, he said, there will be Agarwood tree planting as many as five thousands that will be distributed throughout Bali.

He said that in addition to the local arts and culture staged in the NDF, it also conducts other activities, such as culinary exhibitions, Indonesian crafts fair arranged through the bridge, which is as much as 75 points.

“ We also provide a booth for the preservation of the environment and health, particularly for breast cancer examination as well as information on the activities of HIV / AIDS,” he said.

Meanwhile, a musicologist Franky Raden said the NDF would also perform “world music”. This performance will feature well-known singers and musicians of international level, among others, Celeste Kim from the United States, Baraka (Japan), Ana Alcaide (Spain) and the Orchid House Orchestra (Italy).

“This music event is the appearance of world musicians who collaborates traditional and modern music,” he said.

“At this annual event we also held `Bali Culinary Challenger 2013” by Indonesian Chef Association (ICA), “ he said.

In relation to NDF target of visitors this year, said Abdhi, it is as many as 60,000 people, both domestic and foreign travelers.

“We believe this year visitors will increase compared to last year 51,000 people, because more activities held. Additionally it also provides a vehicle to pick up tourists who are spending their vacation in the area of Nusa Dua to see the exhibition and arts performances at the NDF,” he said.

By Bill Brubake

The Washington Post

The traditional healer, a dark-skinned woman with intense brown eyes, wasted little time introducing herself when we walked into her thatched hut in Kawaza, a village of 48 people from the Kunda tribe in eastern Zambia.

â€œRight now, my name is Fanny,â€ she said. â€œBut when I am possessed I am no longer Fanny. My name becomes Hetina.â€

Fanny was wearing a long white dress decorated with bright red crosses, signifying her status as the village shaman. She was gripping a well-thumbed Bible that she soon would be reading to us while describing how she tackles her village’s health-care issues – from the common cold to HIV/AIDS.

But first Fanny had a question for her three foreign visitors.

â€œIs there anything you’d like to ask me?â€ she said, speaking in her native language, Senga, through our English-speaking guide.

Yes, we had a few questions. Quite a few, as a matter of fact. We had traveled to this corner of central Africa to view some of the most abundant wildlife on the continent. Lions, zebras, giraffes, elephants – all can be found in nearby South Luangwa National Park, an eco-tourism jewel famed for its walking safaris.

On this day, though, my wife, Freddi, our 13-year-old daughter, Gabriela, and I were in search of something more – a glimpse, if only a fleeting one, into the lives of the people who inhabit this region. So with an assist from our safari lodge – a bumpy, 45-minute drive away on a rutted dirt road – we arranged to spend a leisurely afternoon in Kawaza.

â€œAnd how did you become a traditional doctor?â€ Freddi, a nurse who manages a hospital emergency department, asked Fanny.

She smiled broadly, seemingly delighted to tell her story. â€œI was sick as a child, and my parents took me to a regular hospital, which couldn’t find anything wrong with me,â€ she said. â€œThen they took me to a traditional doctor, who found I was suffering from a hidden spirit.â€

Fanny said she was cured by the traditional doctor, which inspired her to become one herself, in the early 1970s. And today, guided by the Bible and what she calls â€œthe spirit,â€ she often heads into the bush to collect plant roots, tree bark and other traditional remedies to treat her patients.

â€œThis is not magic,â€ Fanny assured us.

For us, the encounter with Fanny was pure magic. Not that I was surprised. During three decades of traveling around Africa, Asia and Latin America, I rarely have been disappointed with the side trips I have taken to villages off the tourist circuit.

We had headed to Zambia, a financially struggling former British colony of 11.5 million people that gained its independence in 1964, to gauge how the wildlife there compared to better-known safari destinations, such as Kenya and Tanzania. We were mightily impressed. We spent one night in Lusaka, Zambia’s gritty capital, before taking a flight to Mfuwe, gateway to South Luangwa National Park.

The trip to Kawaza village was easy enough to arrange, thanks to culturally enlightened safari lodge operators in the region who recognize that an African safari need not be limited to viewing animals. We had learned of Kawaza several months before we arrived in Zambia, while perusing the website for Flatdogs Camp, the lodge where we ended up staying, just outside the national park.

â€œUnlike most Traditional Village projects, this one really is a living, working, typical African village where the local people have decided to invite visitors into their lives with no tourism hype at all,â€ the website told us. That sounded promising because some so-called native villages we have visited were little more than tourist traps.

At Kawaza, we learned that villagers had formed a tourism committee about 10 years ago, assisted by Robin Pope, a well-established Zambian safari guide and lodge operator. Some of the villagers already had a connection to tourism, working as guides, drivers, cooks and housekeepers at nearby lodges. But the project would give them a chance to run their own enterprise and earn some badly needed money.

â€œAt first it was hard. We had only 68 visitors the first year,â€ Obby Banda, the Kawaza villager who heads the project, told us in the tidy thatched hut he uses to greet visitors. â€œBut now we have many more. We have even built six huts where visitors can spend the night. No doubt, this tourism project has raised our standard of living.â€

The project isn’t about squeezing every last dollar out of foreign tourists. Overnight visitors to the village each pay US$40 a night, meals and activities included, Banda told us. Day trippers pay $20 for a village tour. Transportation to Kawaza is usually provided by the lodges. (We arrived from Flatdogs in the back of an open-air safari truck; yes, we were a bit conspicuous, if not comical.) Banda said he expects more than 800 visitors this year, contributing about $2,500 to the village economy – a tidy sum in a country where the average annual per-capita income is $1,000. Money not used on community projects, such as upgrading the local school, is split among the villagers.

In the welcoming hut, Banda showed us a promotional flier he uses to entice prospective visitors. â€œWe don’t have electricity in our village,â€ the flier reads in English. â€œBut don’t fear that the dark evenings will be boring.â€ Among the activities offered are traditional dances and storytelling, bush walks and the chance to take part in daily-life activities such as sweeping, grinding grain, weeding and harvesting in the fields.

We passed on the weeding and grinding. But Banda arranged a dance performance in which we were expected to participate. (We did, and the villagers were laughing with us, not at us, I kept telling myself.)

Banda then took us to the aptly named Kawaza Basic School, which serves neighboring communities as well. â€œBefore the tourism project, this school was almost falling down,â€ Banda said, as head teacher David Mwewa nodded in agreement. â€œPupils were sitting on the floors because there were no seats. There were not enough teachers. But, now, things are a lot better.â€

Mwewa told us that revenue from the tourism project also supports students whose parents have died of AIDS – a horrifyingly common occurrence in this part of the world. About 16.5 percent of adults in Zambia have HIV/AIDS, and the life expectancy at birth is 40 years, according to the CIA’s World Factbook.

From the school, we walked across the road to the traditional healer’s hut, furnished with a small table, reed mat and eight simple wooden chairs – one occupied by a hen guarding her eggs. After introductions and a reading from the New Testament, Fanny offered us a glimpse into how she works. I say a glimpse because she didn’t seem keen on explaining how she and her patients get â€œpossessedâ€ – a prerequisite, it seems, for treatment of a serious illness.

â€œI see patients here almost every day, just like a clinic does,â€ Fanny said. â€œWhen the patient comes into the hut, there is usually somebody here who acts like a secretary, recording the name. The patient sings a hymn and says a verse from the Bible. The verse will guide me and I’ll look at my crossâ€ – she pointed to a cross on her dress – â€œand know what the patient is suffering from.â€

We asked Fanny if she could show us some traditional medicines.

â€œThis will help a man’s sex problem,â€ she said quickly, picking up a gin bottle and pouring a few drops on a spoon. She paused to gauge our reaction.

Was she joking? Should we dare crack a smile? We did. And so did Fanny.

â€œAnd these,â€ she continued, turning serious, and grasping a handful of roots, â€œhelp patients who are having seizures.â€

She also spoke of a special bark she boils to treat patients who need blood. â€œI don’t want my patients to use the blood that hospitals want to give them,â€ Fanny said, lowering her voice. â€œThe hospitals get their blood from people whose mother or father may have the deadly AIDS disease.â€

Rashes, infertility, diarrhea – Fanny has remedies for these, too.

â€œThis is not magic,â€ Fanny said, repeating herself.

After a half-hour, we said our goodbyes. But as we were leaving her hut, Fanny told Gabriela that she really liked the cowry-shell necklace she was wearing.

â€œI’ve been looking for these types of shells. I use them to help people with bad luck,â€ Fanny said. â€œI put the shells in a white dish with roots and a liquid, then wash the patient’s face, while we are both facing the east. That brings the patient good luck.â€

Fanny kept staring at the necklace, which Gabriela had bought on a trip to the beach a few summers back.

â€œWould you like me to give you the necklace?â€ Gabriela asked after a few thoughtful moments.

Fanny’s eyes glistened.

â€œGod bless you,â€ she said, grasping Gabriela’s hands. â€œBecause you gave me these shells, I guarantee that you’ll have a lot of luck in your life.â€

Then we were off, ready to resume our safari. As we walked to our vehicle with Banda, several children emerged from their huts, waving and yelling, â€œZikomo! Zikomo!â€

â€œZikomo means thank you,â€ Banda told us. â€œThese children were telling you: ‘Thank you for visiting our village.’â€

French scientists said this week the Ebola virus can swap genetic material to create new strains, a finding with wide ramifications for attempts to curb this vicious pathogen.

Until now, there was only one known strain of the so-called Zaire species of Ebola, the most brutal member of the Ebola viral family. It goes by the acronym of ZEBOV.

ZEBOV accounts for nearly nine-tenths of all deaths from haemorrhagic fever since Ebola was discovered in 1976 and was notably to blame for a six-week outbreak last September and October in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Investigators at France’s Institute for Development Research (IRD) said that a probe into an outbreak of Ebola in Gabon and the Republic of Congo had thrown up a new variation of ZEBOV.

Its genome differs from the known lineage of ZEBOV by between two and three percent, and the change can only be explained by recombination, a process in which two viruses exchange genetic material.

Mutation of this kind is well known in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS.

But, the researchers said, it is “much more rare” for recombination to occur among Filoviridiae viruses, the clan to which the four categories of haemorrhagic viruses belong.

Ebola is deadly to gorillas and chimpanzees as well as to humans.

It causes the feverish patient to bleed under the skin and in severe cases, from the mouth, ears and eyes. Blood loss, shock and organ failure lead to coma and delirium and, in many cases, to death.

The IRD study is based on a mutation of a key protein gene taken from samples from six gorillas and a chimpanzee which died from Ebola in Gabon and the Republic of Congo between 2001 and 2006.

The new variation has been called ZEBOV B to distinguish it from the original strain, which henceforth will be known as ZEBOV A.

A “family tree” of the virus’s evolution and a closer look at samples taken from human cases of Ebola suggest that ZEBOV B emerged from a recombination event that took place some time between 1996 and 2001, and was probably to blame for epidemics that struck Gabon and the Republic of Congo between 2001 and 2003.

The IRD team, led by Gabon-based Eric Leroy, said the discovery would shed important light on the dynamics of Ebola epidemics and implied that “some still unknown, much less pathogenic, strains circulate in the wild.”

It also had important implications for endeavors to create an Ebola virus.

A typical approach in vaccine research is to use a so-called live attenuated virus – a virus whose pathogenicity has been dampened – to induce immune responses against a pathogen.

But this approach would be dangerous in Ebola as the attenuated virus could possibly recombine with a wild virus, creating a new, hybrid virus, the IRD said in a press release.

“The next step is to identify the exact genome location where this genetic material exchange between viral lineages takes place,” the IRD said. “In order to do that, the complete genetic mapping of the different viral strains remains to be accomplished.”

The IRD study was published online on October 17 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in the United States.

An outbreak of Ebola virus in northwestern Republic of Congo killed 5,000 Western gorillas in Congo’s Lossi Sanctuary park from 2002 to 2004, a study published last December in the US journal Science said.

The death toll was probably only a “small fraction” of gorillas likely to have been killed by Ebola in the past decade, it said.

HENLEY-ON-KLIP, South Africa ~ American talkshow host Oprah Winfrey opened a multimillion-dollar school for poor South African girls this week she has funded, saying it was the “proudest, greatest day of my life.”

Winfrey’s school was the culmination of a pledge she made to South Africa’s anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela six years ago, prompting the elder statesman to heap tributes on her at the glitzy opening attended by celebrities.

“We shared our conviction that the years of democracy would be nullified if we did not properly educate our youth. We hope that the school will become the dream of every young South African girl,” Mandela said.

“This is not a distant donation you made, but a project that clearly lies close to your heart. We salute you as a friend and a role model,” he said.

Winfrey fought back tears on Tuesday as she cut a ribbon to launch the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls at Henley-on-Klip, south of Johannesburg, and unfurled the South African flag and the school pennant.

“This is the day I have been waiting for the past six years. This is the proudest, greatest day of my life. This is a supreme moment of destiny for me.”

“When you educate a girl, you begin to change the face of a nation.”

The US$40-million facility, funded entirely by The Oprah Winfrey Foundation, is spread over 21 hectares and composed of 28 buildings with modern classrooms, laboratories and an auditorium.

It will provide free education to the girls from poor families drawn from all of the country’s nine provinces, chosen for their intelligence and leadership qualities.

The star-studded event was attended by celebrities such as Hollywood veteran Sidney Poitier, singers Tina Turner, Mary J Blige and Mariah Carey, film director Spike Lee, comedian Chris Rock and television personality Diane Sawyer.

Many of the celebrities brought along a book that had meant a lot to them to be added to the school library.

“It’s a remarkable adventure and I hope itâ€™s the first of lots of schools. I am going to try help as much as I can and not make this my only visit,” Rock said.

Winfrey drew parallels between herself and the 152 children chosen to study at the school who she calls “my girls.” They in turn call her “Mom Oprah.”

“I was looking for girls with ‘it.’ An incredible, indefinable quality that shines so bright neither poverty nor the circumstances of poverty can dim it,” said Winfrey.

Winfrey, who overcame a poverty-ridden and troubled childhood to gain a net worth of at least $1.5 billion, according to Forbes, said she wanted to give girls like her a chance in life.

“A girl who is educated is less likely to have HIV/AIDS. A girl who is educated is less likely to have a child out of wedlock,” said Winfrey, adding that her charges would be tested for HIV if their parents consented.

South Africa has the world’s second highest caseload of HIV/AIDS in the world, with 5.5 million people in the country living with the virus.

The girls aged between 11 and 13 were chosen after an initial 3,500 applications were whittled down to 500, when Winfrey stepped into the interviewing process.

“I went to their homes; I met their parents and teachers. I know their story because their story is my story,” she said.

Thirteen-year-old Lesego Tlhabanyae from Soweto was ecstatic.

“Iâ€™m so excited. I believe every child deserves a free and fair education. Iâ€™m looking forward to the comfy beds and my new friends,” said Tlhabanyae, who was orphaned when her father shot his wife before killing himself.

When Winfrey visited Mandela six years ago, he asked her to fund worthy causes. She initially pledged 70 million rand for the school but ended up giving 280 million rand.

DENPASAR

Police pursuing the case of the Kuta Cowboys – the so-called gigolos who featured in a handycam “film” made by a Singaporean filmmaker – say they have interviewed all six of the men who appear in the small segment of the movie so far seen.

But they have so far been able to find a mystery woman who they believe has information that would help them declare a suspect.

The six they have interviewed are young men who work at Kuta Beach as surfing instructors – named as Bima, Denis, Arnold, Fendi and Argo – and Ubud identity Ketut Suardana, husband of restaurateur and Ubud Writers and Readers Festival chief Janet De Neefe, who says he appears in the film because Singaporean filmmaker Amit Virmani told him he wanted to talk about HIV/AIDS.

Police said this week the Kuta beach boys all claimed they did not know Virmani was making a film about gigolos. One said he didn’t even know Virmani was filming.

All six are still formally regarded as witnesses and may be questioned again, police said this week.

Police spokesman Gede Sugianyar said the investigation team also planned to interview everyone who appears in the film and Virmani himself, who is in Singapore. They have requested assistance in interviewing Virmani through the national police headquarters and Interpol.

Although women’s groups have emerged across the world, struggling for gender equality and justice, disparity and violence against women continues to be commonplace in Indonesia, limiting the full participation of women in the country’s development.

Melly St. Ange, head of the Bali International Women’s Association (BIWA), spoke with Carla Albertí de la Rosa and stressed the importance of government action and education in bringing about change.

Melly St. Ange: Raising awareness is very important.

Q In places like Bali, women don’t have the same rights as men. For example, if a couple divorces, the children automatically go to the father. What does BIWA think of this?

A If you ask BIWA, as an international women’s club, we don’t agree with this. It’s not fair. But we live in Bali and respect their traditions and culture. If you marry a Balinese you have to follow family regulations. So before you get married to a local Balinese, you have to think about it because you are also marrying all the traditions, family and culture. In my opinion, there’s no other choice.



Q Bali tops the nationwide incidence rate of HIV/AIDS. BIWA is working with the Hati Hati organization to try to combat this. What realistically is being done?

A We give money to the foundation and they visit victims – we call them clients, not victims. They are usually very poor people so they give them money for the food and education. We try to do what we can but it’s still not enough. We need the government to open their eyes and support them. AIDS used to be a taboo but now it shouldn’t be like that. We need to say to people: When you have sex, use a condom. Bali has the second [-highest rate of HIV incidence] in Indonesia. People should talk about it, in the villages, everywhere. The government doesn’t realise we have to talk to the Balinese people.



Q According to figures from the National Commission for Women (Komnas Perempuan), 14,020 cases of violence were reported nationally in 2004. That figure has almost quadrupled in the last couple of years. But many Indonesian women fear asking for help over being publicly stigmatised. What is it going to take for this attitude to change?

A People have to improve their knowledge. This is a traditional taboo, an internal family affair. In Bali and the rest of Indonesia if you speak about this issue it’s embarrassing. We have to keep educating people from banjar(community) to banjar, from community to community, exposing the problem in the newspapers. Everyone has to understand this is not good.

We give money to the Sruti Foundation to produce a book that we give out in the villages. It’s like a comic that explains that the husband cannot hit his wife or kids. But many see their grandparents have done it and they learn from them. We have to teach them that if abuse takes place they have to report it to the police so that aggressors can be put in jail.

Sruti also produce flyers and educate people through workshops. They go to the politicians, parliament, and to the high-ranking officer’s wives to push equal rights. At least there are people moving and trying to do something about it.

Q Police recently found that Indonesian minors have been recruited through Facebook and other sites for prostitution. Some of the girls come from middle-class families without any financial difficulties and it’s the luxury goods that lure them in. Are you going to educate younger ones about the potential hazards of the internet and help stop child prostitution?

A It’s not our field. Other people should do it.

Q East Bali is in dire poverty. Is BIWA helping out?

A We help according to BIWA’s goals. We have been to Selisihan village in Karangasem to ask people in the village what they need. They said they need Albesia trees because they can harvest them in five years and then they can replant again. They can make building material and sell the wood. So we gave them 1,500 baby trees.

We also send our BIWA dental clinic to remote areas in eastern Bali. We visited different schools and village to give free dental treatments. We pay for treatments and medication and give toothbrushes and toothpaste. We have also done this in Singaraja and Lovina.

Last year we gave donations to three schools in remote areas as well. In Bali, government helps schools but not enough. Some don’t have roofs or enough educational materials.

Q From what we see of your members’ postings on Facebook – those who are Bali Times “friends” – they seem to go to a lot of BIWA-organised events like lunches. Is there a danger that BIWA might be stigmatized as a bored-housewives lunch club?

A BIWA is not only for housewives. Our luncheons are a monthly meeting for members. Our members don’t stay in Bali all the time; they travel for business or go back to their countries for a while. So when they’re in Bali they want to join. BIWA is about friendship, cross cultures, networking and charity. If people don’t know BIWA they should click on our website (www.biwa-bali.org).

Q How many members do you have now?

A We have almost 300 members, representing 29 countries.

Q Do they pay a yearly fee to join?

A Yes, Rp250,000, so around US$25. Membership fees are an income to raise money to support BIWA’s social-welfare projects.

Q Breakdown for us where the cash is spent?



A It depends on the proposals. We do a survey and get information and then decide. We act according to our main goal: working to protect women and children.

Q What do you see as the main problems affecting Bali now?



A The government needs to pay special attention to women’s health. Breast cancer, AIDS and cervical cancer are some important problems. Cancer kills you without you knowing. Other issues are children’s malnutrition and children and women abuse, as well as education for poor children.



Q How can they be solved?

A BIWA tries to do as much as possible but the government has to help. The government has to open its eyes and ears, work properly, see their people are suffering. We send press releases to the local newspapers and talk to the government through the media. We are working closely with the governor’s wife, Ibu Ayu Pastika. She’s the head of all the social projects in Bali, including BIWA. Raising awareness is also very important.

Seventeen sex workers rounded up by Denpasar Police in Sanur were offered a choice of five days in jail or a Rp150,000 (US$17.3) fine under anti-prostitution laws.

The women, who came from Indramayu in West Java and Situbondo in East Java, were arrested during the evening of April 7 on Jl Blanjong and Jl Bet Ngandang in Sanur. According to police they were soliciting for sex along the side of the road and charging clients Rp500,000 for their services.

The women were detained under Article 1 of a 1994 law that forbids soliciting of payment for sex as a commercial activity.

At a hearing at Denpasar District Court last Friday the women –aged between 21 and 33 – were sentenced to five days in jail. However, they were permitted to pay a cash fine as an alternative punishment.

“The punishment can be dropped by the payment of a fine of Rp150,000,” said presiding judge Dewa Made Wenten. All 17 women chose to pay the fine and were released after the hearing.

JAKARTA

A gay film festival hailed as the biggest in Asia and the only one in the Muslim world kicks off in Indonesia on Friday, hoping to draw 15,000 viewers to screenings and fringe events.

In its ninth annual edition, the Q! Film Festival (www.q-munity.org/) will showcase 150 films from more than 20 countries including France, Japan and the Philippines, highlighting such issues as gay rights and HIV/AIDS.

Festival director John Badalu said organisers do not expect public opposition but prefer to keep the event low-key due to the “stigma against gays” among conservative sections of the mainly Muslim population.

“We don’t want to publicise the event in the mainstream local media as they’re still very conservative,” Badalu said.

Social networking sites such as Twitter (twitter.com/Qfilmfestival) are abuzz with chat about the event, however, signalling it has already achieved one of its chief aims — to “let people know that the queer community exists in Indonesia,” he added.

Indonesian Muslims are often categorised as “moderate” but such generalisations, favoured by Western diplomats, upset religious and other minorities who have to endure the daily opprobrium of Islamic conservatives.

In March, a regional gay and lesbian conference was forced to cancel when scores of Islamic radicals stormed the venue and reportedly went from room to room hunting participants.

A month later, Islamic vigilantes burst into a civil rights awareness session for transsexuals held by the National Commission for Human Rights and sent the participants fleeing in panic.

Homosexuality is technically legal in the country of 240 million people but it remains a taboo, especially among the 80 percent of the population who are Muslims.

Lawmakers in deeply Islamic Aceh province last year voted to make homosexuality punishable by up to 100 lashes under local religious bylaws which the provincial government has refused to approve.

Communications Minister Tifatul Sembiring, chief of an Islamic party, in June implied a link between pornography and HIV-AIDS, and questioned whether state funds used to fight the disease could not be better spent.

“The country has dispersed Rp180 billion (US$20 million) to curb HIV-AIDS. The budget should actually be reduced so the money can be allocated for other things that are beneficial for the country,” he told reporters.

Despite these attitudes, communications ministry spokesman Gatot Dewa Broto said the central government had given its assurances that the Q! festival could go ahead.

“We have no objections. As long as the content is not too sexually explicit, not too vulgar, we’re OK; we can tolerate it,” he said.

“This festival has been taking place for many years already. I’m sure the organisers know the do’s and the don’ts and consider the ethical and normative nuances in Indonesia,” he added.

Organisers are not taking any chances and have taken steps to ensure the festival takes place without incident.

Screenings, which are free, will be held in private clubs and foreign cultural centres in six cities including Jakarta and Yogyakarta, and Bali from October 13-17.

International backing also provides a protective umbrella and cosmopolitan legitimacy that radical fringe elements would be reluctant to challenge, Badalu said.

“Funding for the festival comes from foreign groups. We hold screenings at foreign centres. The radicals won’t dare to attack us. If they do, it’s like attacking several countries at one go,” he said.

He said Indonesia’s “double standards” on issues of sexuality, morality and privacy left space for events like Q! and what organisers jokingly refer to as the “Q-munity.”

“Indonesians are generally tolerant towards gays because you see, people have double standards. Some claim to be religious but surf porn websites at home; some say no to piracy but still use pirated goods,” Badalu said.

“Anyway, whatever happens, we’ll still be around. We can’t disappear just like that.”

The spirit of Bali is celebrated in a new exhibition of evocative photographs soon to go on show at Ganesha Gallery, at the Four Seasons Jimbaran. Internationally acclaimed photojournalist John Stanmeyer is showing a collection of black and white photographs in the exhibition, which opens on December 9.

Stanmeyer’s work has appeared in National Geographic and Time magazine, mostly over the 12 years he lived in Asia, five of them in Bali. He now lives in Massachusetts, on the American east coast.

His Ganesha exhibition, Island of Spirits, will showcase a series of black-and-white photographs that also feature in his new book of the same name, which he will launch at the exhibition opening.

Stanmeyer, born in Illinois, is a founding member of VII photo agency.

Over his 12 years in Asia, Stanmeyer witnessed throughout that time nearly every major historical event in Asia, photographing the rapid changes taking place throughout the entire region.

Working globally, he has focused on the plight of refugees from the Ugandan civil war, spent months chronicling the effects of the 2004 tsunami and documented the mental healthcare crises in Asia.

Before he moved to Hong Kong in 1996, Stanmeyer covered the conflict in South Sudan, Eastern European social change after the fall of communism, as well as numerous visits to Haiti to record the endless social tragedies plaguing that island nation.

For more than eight years he has documented the spread of HIV/AIDS through every country in Asia. Stanmeyer’s focus is on social injustices, eradication of global poverty, human rights and raising awareness for the sustaining vanishing cultures.

Working regularly for National Geographic Magazine, on contract with Time magazine for over 10 years and photographing for numerous other global publications, Stanmeyer has been the recipient of numerous honours including the Robert Capa award. He has been Magazine Photographer of the Year, been awarded numerous World Press, Picture of the Year and NPPA awards and, in 2008, received the National Magazine Award for this in-depth essay on the global malaria epidemic.

Stanmeyer’s latest book is a journalistic/anthropologic look at Balinese culture documented over the five years he lived in virtual seclusion on the island, was published in November 2010.

Stanmeyer visited remote corners of the island to document esoteric rituals and dances. In order not to “produce yet another lovely colour book on the island of the Gods,” he chose to use black-and-white film and perhaps the world’s simplest camera – the US$25 Holga invented in China in 1981 for the mass market that has become iconic among those who wish to return to the roots of photography and rebel against the digital revolution.

The resulting photos are reminiscent of early photographs before the invention of razor-sharp lenses and high-speed film. Stanmeyer, in spite of his homage to the ancient past, makes no attempt to cover up influences from the post-modern world.

Thus in Cleansing, the supple backs and legs of the young men bathing in a river are tattooed. Intriguingly, at first, the soft focus evokes the impression that the tattoos could be the silhouettes of leaves from the canopy above.

The compositions of the photos are asymmetrical. In Melasti we see only the forearms and wavy blades of two brandished kris against a moody sky.

In Ubud Cremation a lone hand points to the far away peak of a cremation tower carried on the shoulders of a crowd of agitated men. One face juts out firm and steadfast in the chaos.

The collection of photos has also been published in a book produced by Afterhours publishing of Jakarta.

By Hector

THE folly of the Kuta Cowboys imbroglio deepens daily. For the police, who really have more important things to do, the task of the moment appears to be filling in enough forms to ensure they can declare the Singaporean filmmaker a suspect for having failed to obtain a licence to film. That, they say, is secondary to the thorny question of whether they’ll actually be able to arrest him.

Last week’s Editorial put the counter argument with exceptional clarity. On top of that, while there is an extradition treaty in place between Indonesia and Singapore – where the gentleman concerned happens to live – it is not enforceable because Indonesia’s legislature has held up ratification. Perhaps neighbouring Singapore is seen by legislators as too convenient a bolthole to be suitable as an extradition partner.

Meanwhile, in the wake of this silly row – and while police patrol nightly to ensure that the sex trade can carry on unmolested in the Kuta party precinct – all sorts of foolish bit players are getting caught in the mesh. Even Ketut Suardana, confused spouse of “queen of Ubud” Janet De Neefe, has got into trouble. He says, so reports put it, that handycam filmmaker Amit Virmani told him he wanted to talk about HIV/AIDS. But some pretty basic research might have forewarned the good Ketut about the likely real purpose of the interview.

There is, from The Diary’s perspective, nothing particularly wrong with gigolos. They provide – generally without the stone-blind commercial purpose of a female prostitute – companionship and consensual sexual services. It may not be moral, but frankly in today’s world, a lot more is even less so. Indonesia makes a huge song and dance about sexual morality, but it’s no more enforceable here than anywhere else.

Women nowadays are much more open about sex. Young (and not so young) women actively seek sexual encounters, hopefully protected by common sense, especially when out of their home environments. The gigolo market exists chiefly for the Shirley Valentines of this world, those seekers of special comforts who – to put it at its most basic – are no longer lamb but mutton. If it is a crime it is victimless one.



Party Hard!

EXCLAMATION marks are best avoided. Sensible publishing circles regard them as things to be used with extreme rarity. They are known to those in the trade by an indelicate slang term for the male canine endowment. And it’s really not good to make a dick of yourself.

On the face of it, then, it is surprising that the bimonthly glossy Fine Restaurants and Villas has had an appendicktomy, apparently in the course of adding Travel to its masthead. We wonder whether FRV Travel! (Sic) is having some sort of identity crisis. Perhaps chief editorial adviser Stuart Wilford, who also oversees FVRT!’s stable mate, The Beat, but not holding the sort of office from which as Nero showed us it is possible to make one’s horse a Consul, has opted instead for a typographical expression of equal if not equine utility.

It may be that things are not so good at the glossy end of the property market, at least so far as those no longer with the readies to spend in the look-at-the-lovely-pictures advertising sector are concerned. And as for the compliant words that wrap around these extravagances, well there’s only so much you can say about buildings and their contents, even if you do only publish once every two months.

Anyway, it’s something to have a good yak about.

Kampai (Just)



JAPAN Airlines has been a fixture in Bali’s skies – and those of many other destinations – for many, many moons indeed. It is sad, therefore, that from September 30 JAL will not be gliding in – company practice – to Ngurah Rai International Airport.

The pride of Nippon has fallen on very hard times; that this is largely its own fault is no consolation. Its corporate shemozzle (it filed for bankruptcy protection this year) comes at a time when Japanese tourist traffic to Bali is having something of a slump itself. But it will miss the opportunity to capitalise on its eventual return to growth.

JAL announced last October that it would be making swingeing cuts to its services and route network. It wasn’t publicly announced at the time that Bali – a prime destination – would be one of the casualties. But Ngurah Rai’s management was told at the time (setting a first along the way by managing to keep this confidential; unless of course they clean forgot about it or decided it was too early to bother with).

Hopefully, in the months between the private announcement, public acknowledgement and suspension of service, other airlines have been preparing to take up the slack. Garuda comes to mind. Well, sort of. For that matter Japan’s second major airline, ANA, is expanding. Maybe – just maybe – All Nippon’s livery will grace the runway and taxiways of Ngurah Rai some time. That would be nice.

Fair Go

YOU’RE forgiven if you hadn’t noticed – these “special days” are two a penny nowadays – but tomorrow ( May 8 ) is World Fair Trade Day. If this sounds like an oxymoron, or an unreachable dream, remember that since Don Quixote, tilting at windmills has been all the rage.

It is of course a good idea to think about fair trade. The inventively acquisitive tax and excise departments of many countries – Indonesia’s among them – could pause for thought, and wonder how they can learn to lie straight in bed. In the private sector, the rapacious gougers who run import operations on the wharves in Surabaya and Tanjung Priok could similarly seek a Pauline conversion. Customs officers might get off their ass in the same places and enforce the law rather than making things up as they go. We shan’t hold our breath.

Most of the hot air about free trade comes for politicians (who are seeking to avoid any actual impact on the rent-seeking objectives of their paying constituents in the business community or among farmers, who worldwide are notoriously the worst special pleaders of all) and poor Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organisation. He holds the global prize for getting the biggest hospital pass ever. Doh, Ha.

It is the ubiquitous NGO (non-government organisations) sector that gets most of the popular media on matters they declare to be of seminal importance. Who would really give a fig, for example, about the Japanese spending chilly summers just off the Antarctic ice shelves in pursuit of meat from inoffensive and wondrous sea creatures were it not for the loonies of the Sea Shepherd sort who ignore maritime law and the sensible prohibition of piracy, and make high-profile clowns of themselves?

Thus, this weekend, the energetic crew at the Pekerti Foundation, an organisation that bills itself as concerned with development through fair trade in Indonesia, will join in global celebrations of World Fair Trade Day.

Its event will be held at a property at Tampak Siring – the Gianyar hill town that just last month starred as the centre of Indonesian internal summitry – to showcase its suggestions for reducing poverty and controlling climate change. The place is owned by a relative of Pekerti’s long-time handicraft producer, I Made Sujana.

We hear a tree-planting activity will take place to add to the more than 300 albasia trees Pekerti has already planted on the property. This planting, we also hear, is additional to Pekerti’s promise to plant one tree for every US$1,500 in orders received for its producers.

The tree-replacement campaign helps to replace wood used by Pekerti’s producers during handicraft production, encouraging sustainability in Indonesia’s trade industry.

It Never Reines

NORMALLY the ins and outs – such as they are – of the Australian glossy mag world would rate an interest level significantly likely to be outpaced by the attractions of watching paint dry. But from time to time a little gleam of light flashes from heaven, where the denizens of this overhyped medium apparently believe they live and work, and is worthy of comment rather than just another sigh. These are the people who bring us interminable – and frequently wrong – tales of the desperate straits of ‘lil Aussie convicts in dreadful places like Indonesia.

It is a fearsome world of huge competition to see who can produce the most ennui per edition. It is enlivened, in the Odd Zone, by the fact that some of these regrettable publications are within the Rupert Empire and some are not.

Thus we read with interest this week a veritable pool of poison from Ros Reines – unknown personally to The Diary but notable for having once been married to a good friend from many years ago and another continent – in the Rupert Empire’s Sydney tabloid, the Daily Telegraph, about the overreaching demerits of Woman’s Day editor Fiona Connolly. It was Connolly and her mag – it’s jocularly known as Womb & Sty, from how the title sounds in the keep-your-mouth-shut-the-flies-are-coming Australian dialect – who recently brought us the fictionalised version of Schapelle Corby’s impending life-threatening move to a prison facility in East Java. (She isn’t moving.)

Who cares? Well, no one really. Corporately inspired spats between scribblers for rival media empires are tedious. But Reines, a Rupert princess, is no stranger to the eggbeater, either. Connolly, who not at all by coincidence crossed the Rubicon (well, the Rupert) some time ago, might be queen of the trash magazines. But Murdoch tabloids are haemorrhoidal.

Members of the United Nations High-Level Panel (UN HLP) of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda issued a Final Communiqué that they described as an “ambitious yet achievable framework” in their meeting in Bali, Indonesia, recently.

Co-chaired by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the fourth HLP meeting held on March 25-27, 2013, discussed how to build a global partnership and means of implementation for the development agenda.

British Prime Minister David Cameron, another co-chair of the Panel, was absent in the meeting, but he was represented by British International Development Secretary Justine Greening.

Prime Minister Cameron in his video messages in the Bali meeting encouraged three points, namely private sector partnership, getting a global compact, and introducing new development goals.

“First, as we think about the partnerships we need to foster, I hope we support a greater role for private sector investment as the best route to sustainable growth,” the British leader said.

The Bali meeting was crucial because it discussed the eighth Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which is “Developing a global partnership for development”, which has been considered of being neglected and overlooked so far largely because it lacked specific indicators that could be used to hold leaders to account.

The MDGs, agreed on by world leaders at a UN summit in 2000, has set specific targets on poverty alleviation, education, gender equality, child and maternal health, environmental stability, HIV/AIDS reduction and a “Global Partnership for Development”.

After hearing reports from various stakeholders that included women, youth, businessmen, academicians, civil society, and parliamentarians, the HLP agreed on the need for “a renewed Global

Partnership that enables a transformative, people-centered and planet-sensitive development agenda which is realized through the equal partnership of all stakeholders.”

Such partnership should be based on the principles of equity, sustainability, solidarity, respect for humanity and shared responsibilities in accordance with respective capabilities, according to the Panel’s Final Communiqué.

By Anand Krishna

For The Bali Times

Mulat sarira, an expression oft quoted by the Balinese, has been chosen as the theme for this year’s Bali Arts Festival. Meaning self-introspection, mulat sarira is not just a concept, religious dogma or doctrine, but a call for all human beings irrespective of their religious, social, racial, political and economical backgrounds to “go back to the roots and find yourself.”

Unlike any religious call, this is not a call to turn to God. This is not a call to face Kashi, Kaba, or Yerusalem – but to “go within” and find your “self.”

Indeed, this is no ordinary call. For when you turn to God, allegedly all love and all compassion, you may have some consolation. But turning within to find your “self,” you may not find any love or compassion. You may, instead, find hatred and selfishness.

When you pray to All-Hearing God, you expect Him/Her/It, whatever or whoever, to hear your cries and pay heed to your plight. But when you turn within, you are turning to your very “self” who is in plight. There is no consolation; in fact you find your “self” in utter nakedness. You get to see your “self” without any covering, without any dressing. You get to see your “raw” self.

When you do so, do not jump into any conclusion. Do not go within with a heavy burden of your previous conditionings, such as “God is within you,” or “You are essentially God.” Go within with an open mind and open heart. Go within without any expectation, and only then you may find your “self,” your “true self.”

This “process” of going within is “meditation.” Buddha called it vipashanaa. The Buddhists added a set of exercises. Buddha himself never described, or rather prescribed, any exercise. His was a generic call, “Go within,” mulat sarira. No exercises, no initiations – just carry your “one pointed intention” to go within. Just carry your “intense desire” to go within. Carry your “willingness” to find your “self” in its utter nakedness.

There are people who connect vipashanaa or meditation with health, healing, emotional balance and so forth. That would not be mulat sarira; that would not be vipashanaa; that would not be Going Within. You do not go within to heal; you do not go within with any expectation. You go within without any expectation. How can you go within with an expectation to heal, if in the first place you do not even know if you are healthy or not? You may not be in need of any healing. You may be imagining your poor health or emotional condition.

So, once again, go within without any expectation.

And be thankful, be grateful, for whatever you find. It may be love, or it may be hatred. It may be compassion, or selfishness. It may be humbleness or arrogance. It may be wisdom, righteousness, or ego and jealousy. Whatever you find, that is “you.” Once you find your “self,” the next step becomes easy.

Delve into your finding; be true to yourself and what do you want to do with it. Be honest to yourself if you are satisfied with your finding. If the answer is positive – “yes” without any doubt – then nourish it. But if the answer is “no,” then transform it to what you consider as your ideal.

So there are, actually, two aspects to mulat sarira. The first is that of finding your “self,” and the second is what you want to do with it.

Unfortunately these aspects are often forgotten. We understand the phrase, but we do not practice it. It is like having a medical prescription at home from a very good doctor, but not taking it, not consuming the drugs prescribed. This has resulted in a pitiable condition of our society.

Bali, the island of Gods, has more deaths by suicide than any other part of Indonesia. Bali also has the greatest number of HIV infections than any other island in the archipelago. Many would like to blame outside factors for conditions like this. I would not. I would rather do some mulat sarira, some self-introspection, some vipashanaa, some going within to find the root cause of our problems. Where have we gone wrong?

It is easy to use mulat sarira as a slogan, but it is very difficult to practice it. For when I begin to practice it, I find so many faults within me. The number of deaths by suicide, the number of HIV-infected Balinese, the number of robberies and other crimes – all of them are directly connected with me. Scary!

I am turning materialist, in the sense that I can no longer see energy as the source of all and everything. I have begun to believe in the immortality of matter, rather that of energy. I had forgotten, though Einstein reminded me, that matter and energy are relative, yet when it comes to non-ending and non-perishable, they are qualities of energy.

When I went within, the very first lesson I learned was that of the need to find the source of all things, to see things as they are. Having done that, having gone within, I turn to the prophet from Arabia and I found him repeating the same line: “One who knows self, knows God.” I heard the seers of ancient Greece echoing, “Know thyself!” And, I heard Krishna singing to his friend Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, “Your ‘self’ is your best friend and enemy too.”

Mulat sarira is a call to stop relying on all outside factors and begin to rely on oneself. Friends, we are on the journey now. Next week, I shall continue this. I hope, I pray, that you will accompany me.

Bali Province won an award from the Ministry of Health as it has allocated substantial funds in the budget for the health sector and occupied the second best predicate in Indonesia.

“The health sector is a priority in Bali Mandara program. Within the last five years we provide a quite large portion of the budget in line with the implementation of Bali Mandara Health Insurance (JKBM) program since 2010,” said Deputy Governor of Bali, Ketut Sudikerta, in Denpasar.

Sudikerta said that the award has been handed over by the Minister of Health Nafsiah Mboi on the sidelines of the National Meeting of Health for Central Region in 2014, located in Nusa Dua, Badung regency.

“The budget allocation for the health in Bali reached 15.69 percent of the budget last year or second after South Kalimantan that is allocated health budget by 15.78 percent,” he said.

Ketut Sudikerta added that with the support of various components including regencies/ city, the JKBM program benefits are increasingly perceived by the public. Going forward, the provincial government committed to continue to increase the share of the budget for the health sector in line with the extent of the budget.

“Currently the budget of Bali reached Rp4.4 trillion and in 2018 is targeted to reach Rp10trillion,” he said.

In addition to health services through JKBM, said Sudikerta, Bali does not ignore any promoting and preventive efforts. Various breakthroughs done by Bali in the field of health make encouraging results.

“It is shown from the decline in maternal mortality from 95.33 per 100,000 births in 2012 to 72.1 per 100,000 births in 2013. This rate exceeds the national average, which is 102/100,000 births,” he said.

Increasing life expectancy is also an indicator of the success of health development. In addition, Bali also achieve a series of national achievement in 2013among other the highest rate of safe deliveries helped by medical personnel, the best nutrition programs and best health center nationwide.

As for the non-transmitable disease prevention and management of HIV/ AIDS, Bali achieved the second best nationally.

“It’s more a reflection of the good level of public health. For us, it is a motivation to work harder, smarter and agile in handling the health sector in the following years,” said Sudikerta.

Big Plans: Sanglah chief Dr Wayan Sutarga.

With a rabies toll of 26 since the outbreak began on the island last year and dengue fever on the rise, many westerners are hesitant to get treatment in local hospitals. Dr I Wayan Sutarga, the new head of Sanglah Hospital, spoke with Carla Albertí de la Rosa about the hospital’s plans to meet international standards.

Sanglah authorities said last year the hospital was going to be renamed. Is it?

I don’t think so. Sanglah is good enough and everyone around the world knows us as Sanglah Hospital.

How has Australian funding affected the running of the hospital, in particular the new international wing, and the eye unit?

The Australian government works very closely with us and supports us very much to help us develop this hospital.

They developed the Integrated Intensive Care building. It’s composed of the cardiac intensive care unit and the burn unit. They also support us with training. They have given scholarships for staff at Sanglah Hospital to do master degrees. Seven of our staff have already joined a master degree programme in Australia. Shortly they will come back and help us develop this hospital.

The Australians have also given funds to the Bali government to develop the Australia Bali Memorial Eye Centre (AMEC) and Sanglah will be part of the programme. In the last meeting, AMEC and Sanglah agreed to develop a system where AMEC will be the secondary hospital and Sanglah will be a tertiary hospital. The budget will be distributed depending on what area of services to develop in AMEC and what area of services to develop at Sanglah Hospital. AMEC and Sanglah will work very closely to improve the quality of services.

Is there ongoing cooperation between the Australian government and Sanglah Hospital? And if so, what?

I really want this to happen. But the regulation is only between Canberra and Jakarta. But personally, we have very close contacts with people in Australia who give us advice and ideas. Most tourists in Bali are Australian and Sanglah Hospital wants to be a good hospital to support tourism.

We want to make sure Bali’s tourists are safe. We already work with the Australian hyperbaric association for our services to meet international standards. I will promote cooperation in Jakarta.

Sanglah celebrated its 50th anniversary last December. What have been the milestones in that time?

We launched the Cochlear Implant program. The cochlear bone is in the ear. We’ve found about 24 babies in Bali that did not have a good cochlear bone, so they were deaf. We replace the bone with an artificial bone so the baby can hear again.

Another highlight has been the integration between education and medical services. A teaching hospital is the best type of hospital. But in Indonesia, some teaching hospitals are not as good as non-teaching ones. So there’s something wrong. Teaching and medical services should be integrated, because good services will lead to a good teaching process and a good teaching process will also affect the medical services.

We are a teaching hospital and we will be the best one in Bali.

What are the main health issues affecting Bali now?

We’re still struggling with infectious diseases. Dengue is still a problem as well as some new emerging disease such as swine flu, bird flu, and since last year we’ve been fighting against rabies. Bali never had rabies, but in the last year it’s already infected [nearly] all of Bali.

An island-wide alert has just been issued over dengue fever. How many cases has Sanglah had recently?

Around 20 cases. They will increase with the rainy season.

What is the best way to wipe out rabies in Bali?

It’s very simple: control the dogs. Also, if someone is bitten they must be vaccinated.

Aren’t people controlling their dogs?

Balinese people love dogs very much. They are part of our lives. But if you love someone you should be responsible and look after them. They should give them vaccinations and have them under control so they don’t bite anyone. If a dog bites someone, the owner should be held responsible for it. But many people don’t see it like that.

I understand that it’s the first time this (a major rabies outbreak) has happened in Bali and we need time to make people respond.

As a regional government-funded hospital, Sanglah accepts patients from as far as the outlying islands in East Nusa Tenggara province. What percentage of your in- and out-patients are people not living in Bali? And what are they suffering from?

About 10 percent. They suffer from very serious conditions such as cancer or heart attacks.

Many Westerners living in Bali are fearful of being treated in local hospitals and either attend international clinics here or go abroad, to Singapore for example. Are their fears of lack of medical expertise and equipment at local hospitals justified? How does Sanglah measure up internationally?

Some of our areas don’t meet Westerners’ standards. But even though customer service is not as good as in the West and needs to be improved, just like our teamwork still needs to be strengthened, some areas are above the standards or at least meet them. The international wing or our surgery and nursing meet these standards.

The image of our hospital also plays its part. Westerners think we’re the same as 20 years ago, but things have changed a lot. That’s why we need to work on our website, to show how good we are.

As the new head of Sanglah Hospital, what are your aims? What do you hope to have achieved during your time at the helm?

Our aims, not just mine. We want this hospital to have fully attained international standards in the next five years.

I personally want everybody in the hospital to work hard and to contribute with a maximum performance to achieve our dreams.

In five years, Sanglah won’t be as sophisticated as the Mayo clinic or some other sophisticated clinics in America or Europe. We want to meet international standards, but Sanglah will still be a Balinese hospital.

To make that happen we will strengthen our internal business process. All the procedures and management in the hospital will be improved as much as possible.

We also want to improve the medical and nursing education in the hospital and reorganise our research. We have done so much research, but it hasn’t been properly organised or published. We want to publish our research through our website for the world to see. We hope scientists from abroad will join us in our research and that we can join the international research effort.

The Bali government’s newly launched free Mendara healthcare programme doesn’t cover people with HIV because they have to take anti-retroviral drugs throughout their lives and it’s too expensive. What are you going to do to improve the lives of the 2,400 reported citizens that are affected by the disease?

The scheme doesn’t cover antiretroviral drugs but they still cover the disease. People with HIV can have tuberculosis; it still takes care of that.

Antiretroviral drugs will be donated by the Jakarta government.

Many parts of Indonesia are risk areas for malaria. However, because of its sea breezes Bali is said to be free of the disease. Is this true?

I don’t want to comment on that. I can just say that I hope so.

“I am Sad that I Have to Move to Another Country. I Love Indonesia” - The Bali Times,"I open this note with the statement of John Locke from his famous book The Second Treatise of Government in 1690 : “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any supervisor power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law …",,2013-02-25T06:45:35+00:00,"“I am Sad that I Have to Move to Another Country. I Love Indonesia”

I open this note with the statement of John Locke from his famous book The Second Treatise of Government in 1690 : “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any supervisor power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for this rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth, nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it.”

This statement clearly stated that human being is not under the domination of other human beings. We are free and equal in a natural way. But on the contrary, there is a restriction of rights and different treatments are legalized in our social life. Sexual minority groups (gay, lesbian, and transgender) seen as a deviant and immoral people. Thus they have big tendencies to be stigmatized.

Starting from the idea that the Victorian era has found a central place in popular culture as a period of excessive sexual austerity, repression and prudery, homosexuality is placed as “out of margin” and “out of history”.

A “real” women and a “real” man are showed as a perfect relation in order to do procreation. Some autocratic countries impose sanction to homosexual groups. But the case of Indonesia is something unique. Indonesia does not have some detailed regulations to give a sanction to them. But Indonesia is likely to have an authority to punish them. Homosexual groups are considered as a “Pesakitan” or prisoner. They continuously are punished, discriminated, and even criminalized.

Thus as a “Pesakitan”, instead of they stay in Indonesia and hide their sexual orientation as a hidden homosexuals, what are they doing? Or one question that should be appropriate is what should they do? This simple question invites me to know of their existence outside of Indonesia, not those who move between provinces in Indonesia, but those who move overseas. This opinion is based on my ongoing doctoral dissertation about Indonesian gay that moves to Paris and their interactions with their families in Indonesia within the analytical framework of the provision of social support.

The silencing of gay peoples in Indonesia became a fear for them. Silencing is not only unable to express their expression and opinion, but more than that. Physical and psychological discrimination often happens thus they became stressed and depressed.

One of the effect of globalization is migration that not only an activity to move from one city to another city, but from one country to another country. Globalization seemed to give permission to lose all the processes, for example the international division of labor and global, the emergence of a global culture, global finance and capital movements, global flows of images, commodities, people as refugees, tourists and travelers, global social movements, global civil society and citizenship, multiple and fluid identities, global risks, pandemics and also organized crime. Globalization makes all the elements such a ‘’borderless world’’.

Obviously for gay peoples migrate to other cities or abroad apparently not an option but a necessity. Migrated to Paris is a kind of big dream for them. Some queer cities like New York, Paris, Sydney, London, Amsterdam, etc. are the main attraction (pull factor) as a destination for migration. But I found that for gay peoples in Indonesia, pull factor and push factor are not two factors that should be taken one. The explanation is that push factor encourages them to immediately go abroad because of the limitations of expression in the country of origin. On the other side, pull factor is a driving factor in looking at the targeted country as a country that upholds the freedom of gay peoples.

Binnie said that migration represents a key way in which space and place play a significant part in the formation of sexual identities, cultures and communities. These formations are not only the freedom from restrictive laws, but also the freedom of become something and someone else. Thus in order to survive and to produce an identity, they need to migrate to a big city (where they can express their expression) in the first place.

As my respondent, I met 40 indonesian gays who have at least three years living in Paris. They came for many reasons, just for a vacation, looking some jobs and to study, accompanied by a very similar experience; accidentally met a French gay, fall in love, extend their stay in Paris, and ended up with living together.

I found that initially they do not know anything about how to life in Paris. For them, Paris is a romantic city; Paris has Eiffel tower, Paris has a museum of Louvre. And in addition, French men are very romantic. My respondents did not mention the representation Paris as a fairly permissive to homosexuals. However, this is not very surprising since Paris is not an ideal city as a place to stay for them. In contrast to the Netherlands as an ideal country to be used as a home for them because it cannot be denied that historically, a kinship relation on the basis of colonialism still cannot be removed.

All interviews ends with a sadness feeling. From the bottom of their hearts, they do not want to migrate to Paris. They prefer to live with their nuclear family in Indonesia. For them, surviving in a foreign country without or lack of social support from their nuclear family, a life of course is not still perfect.

Whereas in the 1980’s, precisely in 1982, the first organization that has a focus on the discourse of homosexuality, Lambda Indonesia, successfully established by Dede Oetomo. This organization has an aim to introduce homosexuality lightly through mass media. One big case that has a great contribution in changing the perspective of thinking about homosexuality is increasing a HIV/AIDS virus as a sexually transmitted disease that was allegedly caused by homosexuality. Since then, they are labeled as a “Pesakitan”; a person who sinned against nature.

What my almost all respondents want is that they wanted to return to Indonesia and hanging out together with their nuclear family, but the situation does not seem to allow them to return to Indonesia. That they were born as a homosexual is not there desire. The situation is the same one with those who were born as a women and men. Did they ask to be born as a women and men?

Being a women, men, gay, lesbian, and transgender, for me personally, is not a big deal. How do we honor them, is to look at their contributions to the state, rather than their physical appearance. Their migration to another country from their country, as in my dissertation, is not absolutely their fault. The issue that they move, intentionally or even unintentionally, is due to concerns about their existence as a gay people. If the state does not engage the practice of discrimination, they will never move to another country.

To close this little note, It becomes interesting when French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau through his masterpiece, Social Contract, said that every man must be free of any unimpeded, although in the end there should be a social contract. But it must be understood, and agreed together to create security, freedom and equality of mankind to achieve sovereignty. And also interesting to understand the statement of John Stuart Mill in his masterpiece, De La Liberté, that happiness will never be able to walk without the freedom of the individual, and to get it, we cannot impose a single model.

Tourism Moratorium Should be Part of Bali Planning - The Bali Times,"An economy observer Dr I Gde Made Sadguna encouraged that moratorium of tourist accommodation becomes an integral part of construction planning in Bali. “For me, moratorium is not only for South Bali, but also a part of the island planning as a whole so it could synergy and support each other,” he said in Denpasar. …",,2013-07-22T03:30:29+00:00,"Tourism Moratorium Should be Part of Bali Planning

An economy observer Dr I Gde Made Sadguna encouraged that moratorium of tourist accommodation becomes an integral part of construction planning in Bali.

“For me, moratorium is not only for South Bali, but also a part of the island planning as a whole so it could synergy and support each other,” he said in Denpasar.

He thought that there is no clear blue print on Bali development, so moratorium appeal delivered by the Governor Made Mangku Pastika several years ago is very relevant.

“However, it should not only stop but think to prepare a good planning,” he said.

After that, he added, it should be analyzed properly on its advantage and disadvantage, then a decision should be made to continue the moratorium or open a new tourist accommodation opportunity.

“Because if it is without analysis, so it just only a construction without a good planning,” he said.

Sadguna hoped that all parties have commitment to think Bali development as a unity (one island management) and immediately meet so it’s not only rhetoric.

“It’s all people responsibility, not only regional government, including important role of community and figures of local community,” he said.

On the other hand, regarding to reclamation in the area of Benoa Bay that is planned to build tourist accommodation, Sadguna has concern that it will cause various social impacts.

“Not only environmental impact, but also social culture and economy impacts. I suggest people could take the opportunity,” he said.

If it is unprepared, he said, so Balinese people only become a spectator. “Other people will take the opportunity but we only get the trash or negative impacts,” said Sadguna.

Meanwhile, the Vice Chairman of Bali Parliament Ida Bagus Putu Sukarta said that the plan of Benoa Bay reclamation in Badung Regency should be stopped.

“The executive should take Balinese people aspiration. We disagree with the reclamation. Let’s take our people aspiration into account. Just stop the reclamation,” said Sukarta in Denpasar.

He hoped that the executive absorb people aspiration and respond to their objection on the reclamation. Don’t force the reclamation as it will harm the community more. Don’t just think about reclamation and establishing tourist accommodation.

“Let’s absorp and listen to Balinese people aspiration and be courageous together. Stop the reclamation plan since it harm pBalinese eople more,” he said.

The politician from Sanur also asked all components of community to understand the purpose of big investors behind the reclamation plan, because marine reclamation is only for business purposes not environment preservation.

“We should think dynamically but the structure of environment and culture should not change fundamentally,” said the Chairman of DPD Gerindra Bali.

Sukarta further said that the reclamation will bring negative impact on social culture structure. The behavior of Balinese people will change and accelerate in higher life competition.

He took example of Serangan Island reclamation in Denpasar that changed the social culture pattern of the local people. The crime is higher as around the location are cafes that employ women, as a result there are cases of HIV/ AIDS. Physically, Serangan Island reclamation made beaches in Sanur, PAdanggalak, and Lebih (Gianyar) got abrasion due to the change of sea stream.

“So, dn’t let similar condition happen due to reclamation in Benoa Bay. Besides, the economy and business activities will be focus on Southern of Bali, thus the balance and equality of economy and development will not come true,” he said.

JAKARTA

UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Executive Director Yury Fedotov has offered UNODC’s support to Indonesia to fight transnational crime and corruption, particularly as they relate to environmental crime.

“UNODC and our partners are ready to continue the excellent working relationship we have established with the KPK and we will continue to support the national efforts in corruption prevention and eradication,” Fedotov said at Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), according to the United Information Center Jakarta Office in a press statement received here.

He stressed the importance of a national anti-corruption strategy and the work done by KPK and praised the country’s efforts and the commitment of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to independent anti-corruption agencies.

“UNODC recognizes KPK’s work in devising and implementing the National Strategy on Corruption Prevention and Eradication. We reaffirm UNODC’s commitment to supporting KPK’s strategic plan,” he added.

Fedotov highlighted in particular UNODC Indonesia’s pioneering work on supporting the government’s efforts to combat emerging threats such as corruption, illicit drugs, transnational organized crime, and wildlife, forest and environmental crimes.

In particular, he stressed the unwelcome links between corruption, the criminal justice system and forest crimes.

Fedotov made his comments during a press conference with reporters at a joint session with KPK Chairman Commissioner Abraham Samad.

The session entitled “Challenges and Opportunities in Tackling Corruption in Indonesia” was held at KPK to promote activities planned throughout Indonesia for World Anti-Corruption Day, on Sunday 9 December 2012.

The KPK event took place during the second day of Fedotov’s four-day mission to Indonesia, the concluding leg of his five-country, 12-day inaugural visit to Southeast Asia to engage both with government counterparts and civil society partners.

Prior to Indonesia, Fedotov visited Thailand, Myanmar, Viet Nam and Lao PDR where he exchanged view with regional leaders on the human security challenges facing the region and how the United Nations could respond better.

Indonesia is a critical regional hub and is consequently home to the largest single UNODC country programme in the region. The UNODC programme in Indonesia provides support to anti-corruption efforts by the Supreme Court, the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), the criminal justice system and law enforcement generally.

It also involves civil society mobilization to better combat emerging threats such as corruption and linked deforestation.

“Transnational organized criminal syndicates operating in Indonesia and the region play a role in illicit resource extraction ¿ like protected natural resources, timber, fish and other wildlife ¿ and crimes which harm the environment. They are a threat to public health and society’s well-being”, he said, adding “Let’s put them out of business!”.

Following his arrival, Fedotov also met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. R.M. Marty Natalegawa, the Minister of Health Dr. Nafsiah Mboi, the Vice Minister of the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) Dr. Ir. Lukita Dinarsyah Tuwo, and other key government officials, such as Gories Mere, the head of the National Narcotics Agency (BNN), and Police General Timur Pradopo, the Chief of the Indonesian National Police.

In his meetings, Fedotov emphasized that UNODC, in partnership with the Indonesian government, is dedicated to strengthening the rule of law and improving the capacity of anti-corruption institutions, fighting transnational organized crime, terrorism, implementing prison reform; and in particular, combating environmental crime, corruption, drug use and HIV.

DENPASAR

Starting from bitter experience in the past, a woman from the United States was committed to provide solutions for other women. Previously she had lost a friend who works as a midwife, died in childbirth. In fact, she also had lost a sister and a baby due to complications during the third pregnancy.

About 22 years ago, a woman who’s the real name is Robin Teresa Jehle with her husband William Joseph Hemmerle Jr. finally decided to leave the country and settle in Bali for the sake of mission how to deal with pregnant women and their babies to be born.

At Banjar Nyuh Kuning, Desa Mas, Ubud, a midwife who is better known as “Ibu Robin Lim” is devoting his life as a midwife in prenatal care at the same time offering safe and healthy childbirth assistance for women for free.

Her goal is simply to save women, particularly reducing maternal mortality and infant during delivery, which is still relatively high in Asia, including in Indonesia.

According to Lim, maternal and infant mortality is still high and alarming, recorded maternal mortality rate has now reached 359 per 100 thousand live births, while the results of the survey of 2012 was only 228 per 100 thousand of live births.

According to a woman who was born in November 24, 1956 the management of deliveries in Indonesia are mostly still very bad and very expensive. Therefore Lim together with 10 midwives and 3 doctors who helped at the clinic called Bumi Sehat emphasize the principle of “Gentle Birth “, the birth process that lasts a quiet, safe / healthy and affectionate.

According to Lim, her team has special procedures and equal treatment for every pregnant woman. Although she is a celebrity, expatriates, foreign tourists, mothers of poor family’s even women of prostitutes and even HIV / AIDS still get privilege or VIP.

“There is no class distinction for any pregnant women who come here to ask for our help, they are the same for us,” he said.

Through her clinics in Bali and Aceh, that mother of 8 children seeks to carry out humanitarian missions and rescue of women by targeting disadvantaged areas or affected as when the tsunami in Aceh in 2004 and the typhoon in Philippines.

Various awards have been successfully achieved. Robin Lim was judged to have chalked professional dedication services for the birth and women in Indonesia even in the world. Therefore, in 2011 she was awarded as a CNN Hero of The Year.

Intending visitors to our island had even more cause to worry about their holiday this week when alerts were issued over a potential new health outbreak: Legionnaire’s disease, a bacterial infection that can be fatal and that has reportedly struck down 10 Australians who became ill after returning home from Bali.

Health chief Nyoman Sutedja told the Australian authorities this week, following a request from the Australian Consulate-General in Denpasar, that so far there was no evidence of Legionnaire’s in Bali but that further checks were being carried out, with suspicion falling on hotels in Kuta that are failing to maintain adequate sanitary standards.

That wasn’t enough to prevent the Australians from issuing a travel alert for Bali to its citizens, saying: “Indonesian health authorities and the World Health Organisation are aware of the problem and are investigating possible sources of outbreak.”

It is of particular concern that Legionnaire’s, identified in the US in 1976, develops in warm-water environments such as plumbing and air-conditioning, and is contracted through inhalation; the mortality rate can be as high as 50 percent. Many low-cost “Melati”-class establishments in Bali provide substandard facilities including bathroom services. Tap water in Bali, and indeed around the country, is not suitable for human consumption – too many visitors can testify to this inadequacy, alas – but beyond that, failure to service and clean water systems is a major health issue, not only for Legionnaire’s disease but also for endemic diseases such as dengue fever, whose virus resides in water-hatching mosquitoes.

The Health Department must immediately launch a check of all small-hotel operators in Bali, particularly around the Kuta area, a favourite of budget-holiday Australians. It must ensure that those who are in breach of hygiene regulations are forced to close if they do not immediately – to a near deadline – act to ensure the health and safety of their guests. The Bali Hotels Association, which represents primarily the international sector of the industry, is taking steps of its own to ensure adequate maintenance is done and world-standard checks applied.

Bali is in the midst of a virulent outbreak of rabies that has claimed more than 120 lives in two years. Amid a disastrously hopeless campaign to vaccinate the primary carrier of the virus, street dogs, instead of drastically cutting back their massive numbers, human deaths will continue, thus causing immense harm to Bali’s international reputation.

On a more local level, Governor I Made Mangku Pastika has ordered the closure of illegal roadside bordellos operating under the guise of cafés and frequented by Balinese and other Indonesians as Bali’s HIV infection rate soars, placing our island among the top AIDS regions in the country. This directive must be enforced by the authorities to ensure they are made to shut down.

We have been hit by serious global health crises in the recent past, among them SARS and swine flu. Our current emergencies are peculiar to Bali, and that should make them eminently easier to deal with. Failure to act could result in a swift downturn in visitor numbers at a time when they are at a record high.

Being a Hindu yogi once meant renouncing worldly pleasures for a life of solitary meditation and wandering the jungle in search of union with god, but today’s new-age yogis wander the globe from one retreat to another, stay in luxury hotels and preach to the converted masses through a headset microphone, writes Angela Dewan



At the BaliSpirit Festival last month, yogis sold their take on life – along with complementary DVDs – as visitors from as far afield as the United States, Australia and Europe lapped up expensive yoga apparel, mats and mala beads. Just stepping through the festival gates cost US$100 a day.

“I bought a gold pass for $500 and I find it hard to get $100 worth of yoga a day. At the same time, all the classes have been amazing, so in the end I’m happy to have paid that,” said Australian Jean Cameron, 39.

A 2008 study published by the Yoga Journal valued the yoga industry in the United States alone at almost $6 billion a year, with some more recent estimates for the global industry rising to $18 billion.

Bali is an obvious hub for yoga fanatics. The Balinese are Hindu, the island is rich with natural beauty and the government supports spiritual tourism including temple tours and visits to traditional healers.

Demand for such experiences spiked recently with the publication of Elizabeth Gilbert’s bestselling memoir Eat, Pray, Love – a romantic journey of self-discovery featuring a mystical encounter with a Balinese soothsayer.

Uma Inder, a Hatha yoga teacher, has witnessed the radical transformation of yoga in Bali. She moved from England to the island 22 years ago, spending her first seven years practising yoga alone in the jungle.

“In those days you didn’t talk about yoga and no one really knew about it. Nowadays, it’s a social buzz. It’s now talked about; it’s paraded; and it’s very much about entertainment,” Inder said.

Festival organiser Meghan Pappenheim makes no apologies for the commerciality of the event, and sees it as a positive way to draw more people to yoga.

“I’m the first to admit I’m an entrepreneur; I’m a capitalist. This event has a target market, and those are the people with the money who can go home and make a difference,” the New Yorker said.

“My philosophy is that you make money and then you give it away. You make enough to buy a phone and a nice car, and you give the rest away.”

Only four years old, the festival itself has yet to turn a profit. But Pappenheim and her Balinese husband, Kadek Gunarta, say they have used the yoga boom to raise $36,000 for charity through various events.

The festival has a sponsor, Fiesta condoms, which donated $25,000 for an HIV/AIDS outreach programme for Balinese high school students.

So far, Pappenheim and her husband have funded the festival from money they make from a collection of businesses, which include a yoga centre an art gallery, an eco-friendly furniture studio and a cafe.

Pappenheim is optimistic that the festival too will become profitable as attendance numbers double annually. This year, she estimates 4,000 people participated.

Indonesians have an extremely low percentage of rhesus-negative blood compared to others – almost none. With two million foreign visitors arriving in Bali each year, scarcity of rare blood might not meet demand and in some cases transfusions cannot be carried out. Carla Albertí de la Rosa spoke with Dr A.A. Gede Sudewa Djelantik, director of Sanglah Hospital’s blood bank since 1973 about the need for blood and the importance of donations from tourists.





The Red Cross Unit at Sanglah sends donates blood outside Bali. What percentage of donations are sent out and where to?

We send blood all around Indonesia, and sometimes Singapore. Especially rare blood. We send less than one percent outside of Bali.

How do you cope with blood requirements for locals and foreigners in Bali and how much is needed compared to how much is given?

For our people in Bali we don’t have any problem. In Bali we have an organisation of blood donors, PDDI.

The problem is that in Indonesia we don’t have rhesus-negative blood. Indonesians are 99.9-percent rhesus positive. In other countries they have 10-percent rhesus negative. Bali is a tourism area and if foreigners need rhesus-negative blood it’s very hard to get it.

We also have the rare blood organisation donor, so we organise expats who work in Bali. If they have rhesus negative, we take their name, address and telephone number and if we need their blood we just contact them.

In one donation they give 300ml. We have enough blood. That’s why we can send it outside sometimes. But the problem is that sometimes there’s an emergency. We tell expat donors to keep the blood in their body until someone needs it.

What kind of screening is done by blood banks in Indonesia and do all follow similar standards of screening and storage?

We follow the standard of the World Health Organisation (WHO). We screen for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, for syphilis. We can keep the blood in the blood bank in good condition for up to five weeks, but it’s normally used after two weeks. It is kept between 2 and 10 Celsius.

But in the rest of Indonesia, it’s not like that. They must follow the recommendations of WHO; they try but not all follow them.

Is there a centralised information centre in Indonesia that can tell which blood bank has what stocks, so that in an emergency this information can be used to procure blood and save time? If not, what would it take to have one?

In Bali we have it. It’s at Sanglah Hospital. We are the centre and get information from the districts, to know how much they have and how much they need.

But in the rest of Indonesia it’s not like that. We keep pushing the Indonesian Red Cross in Jakarta to have it.

How has technology helped blood banking?

Before, they extracted blood and gave it to the patient directly. Now, we screen and, for example, if somebody is ill and they need only the red blood cells, we don’t give them the plasma but only the red blood cells.

What type of blood is most needed and how many blood banks are there in Bali?

O negative, like everywhere else. There are nine blood banks in total.

In places like Bali, where healthcare is not the ultimate and where some foreigners fear getting treatment at local hospitals, how can you promote blood donation, and is it a safe practice?

In Bali we have PDDI. We ask members to spread information and we also give information to donors who come here. We put signs in hotels and we go to the hotels to collect blood, only if it’s rhesus negative. We need help for rhesus-negative blood. We ask people who come to Bali to visit to please give blood. It’s very important for us. Many people are scared but it’s perfectly safe.

Why does former vice president Jusuf Kalla, now head of the Indonesian Red Cross, say the Sanglah unit is a “model for the country”?

PDDI is the organisation of volunteer donors that has 400 units of organisation in Bali. In each unit they have a certain number of fixed donors. There are 23,000 regular donors in Bali. Every day we have around 70 to 100 people donating. We are very well organised.

Is there a difference between blood-donation requirements of foreigners and that of Indonesians?

No, there isn’t. We use international standards for everyone, although foreigners are generally bigger than Indonesians and they can give 500ml. But we still collect 300ml. The only difference is that if someone comes on holidays, then we are more flexible if they want to donate, as we can go to the hotel to extract blood.

Some foreigners in Bali have told this newspaper that they would like to donate blood regularly – say, every month, because they do this at home and would like to keep up the practice. Is this possible?

If they are rhesus negative we ask them to keep the blood in their body until we need it. Wait for us to ring. Rhesus positive can give their blood every three months. But it’s better for people to give when we need it because we can only keep blood for five weeks.

For what kind of accidents and illnesses do foreigners require blood transfusions?

Traffic accidents are very common. But also people with thalassemia, leukaemia, anaemia or when a mother has a miscarriage.

Are there some cases where blood supplies are simply not available and the patient can’t get a transfusion?

Sometimes it happens because in one day everyone needs the same type of blood. Then we contact PDDI and tell them what we need. For example at Galungan, no one gives blood so we might not have enough.

What have been the most challenging times for the Sanglah unit?

Even if we have a challenging moment like during the Bali bombings in 2002, we still have good communication with PDDI, and we receive more donations. We are just very busy collecting blood.

The problem we have is finance. Some donors have to pay. If government helps then it’s not necessary, but screening costs money. If they’re poor people they don’t pay.

Looking ahead, how do you see the Red Cross in Bali developing?

We have to move together, cooperate with the Red Cross and PDDI. We will continue developing our good organisation and have good communication. We just need to keep informing foreigners about the shortage of rhesus negative. If you live in Bali and you want to help people who need it, give us your details we will contact you when we need your blood.

By Gemma Baker

For The Bali Times

MOMBASA, Kenya ~ I returned to Kenya three weeks ago, this time independent of the volunteering agency I had been with previously. After seeing what was unfolding on the news, I knew I had to come back to help.

My first day back was heart wrenching I walked around Mombasa with tear-filled eyes; I was so sad to see the usually happy Kenyan people looking more subdued and contemplative.

There is a certain tension in the air, but the Kenyan people are still so welcoming to volunteers and tourists, with their big smiles and swahili greetings of jambo! and karibu! (hello! welcome!). I have found the experience this time to be just as rewarding as the few months I spent here before Christmas.

I have not seen any skirmishes, only evidence of demonstrations in the streets. The school where I work is in the area where most of the riots took place; there is ash and the smell of burning where little wooden and corrugated-iron makeshift homes and prized food stalls were erected.

While the politicians dispute, and locals and security forces battle on the streets, it is the children who have the most to lose, so it was good to see the schools reopen last week, and I was there to greet them.

A few of the children did not return as their family homes and businesses had been burned down. They were in displacement camps elsewhere or otherwise they could not return as their parents were unable to afford the fees due to lack of employment.

Mombasa relies heavily on tourism. Itâ€™s the backbone industry here, and a lot of the hotels have had to let their staff go due to the decrease in visitors, and the slowdown has had a knock-on effect on local businesses. The locals keep telling me to go home and tell everyone that Kenyans are a “peace-loving” people, and that it’s the thugs causing all the problems.

The first day back at school was full of the cheeky and loveable faces that I had tearfully said goodbye to on the last day of term last year. These children are so keen to learn, with their dog-eared books, torn clothes, dirty bare feet and skeletal bodies. They were happy to return to school. The school I work in is a long mud hut made up of three classrooms, with catering for 160 students ranging from 3 to 16 years old. Last year I taught alongside six other volunteers, and two skilled African teachers. This year I am the only volunteer. The work is hard. It’s hard to keep the studentsâ€™ concentration up with so little staff, and especially for those children who have not eaten a meal, and fall asleep on the desks or mud floor in the afternoon.

When a mango from the tree outside hits the corrugated iron roof of the mud hut, all the children race out of the classroom and scramble for the fruit that has fallen. The winner takes the first bite, but usually shares it with his friends. It’s amazing how generous the African people can be – I was even offered a bite of a mango from a grubby-handed child the other day. Most of these children are starving and have limited access to water. I saw one of them eating the shavings from my pencil the other day.

Teaching in a mud hut with very small windows and no fan is like trying to work in a sauna. I am constantly wiping my brow, and I am worn out by dayâ€™s end. My job is to teach English and maths (every evening I have to go over the next dayâ€™s class and become reacquainted with the likes of long division and fractions). Thankfully I am not responsible for teaching the older students. There are no toilet facilities – I usually have to plan ahead and hike 10 minutes to the nearest one – and the children go in the local dump next to the school, which means there is always a foul smell in the air.

Last year there were no textbooks, but thankfully, due a generous donation from my employer, Vodafone, I was able to fill a cupboard full of textbooks for the various different grades in the school, and pay for all the students to complete their end-of-year exams. Students who don’t complete them don’t advance to the next grade, so therefore students from very poor families were repeating the same kindergarten class over and over, with children half their age.

I also purchased an extensive first-aid kit as the children were walking around with the biggest gaping wounds, burns and grazes. The only problem with that is, the children without bandages were insistent on getting bandages too, so I had queues of children wanting to have a pink plaster on their little black limbs. Today I was advised to get a HIV test, as some of the children have the virus. I get the results on Monday.

Last year, thanks to donations, I was able to contribute to every class in the school going on a day trip to either a local wildlife park or the beach for the day. Even though these children live next to a paradise of beaches and in the midst of the best safari parks in the world, they very rarely get to see anything more than the area surrounding their homes.

The children are a pleasure to teach, and insist on me assigning homework at the end of each day – they won’t go home without it. The homework is completed in their small wooden or mud huts before sunset or by the light of a kerosene lamp. Most of the children work very hard when they get home. I have seen them sitting in the front of their huts washing the family clothes, fetching heavy loads of food or fuel and even sometimes cooking.

I have lots of stories to tell of my time here in Africa. Kenya and the Kenyan children will always be in my heart. I know I will return here again soon. I’ll have to start saving again when I return to Dublin. We are so lucky in the Western world to have luxuries, but what I have seen of the African people, they live day to day, food to mouth and have no savings accounts, big cars, electricity, TV or hot water.

But they are happy people, welcoming and friendly, and they have a great community setup. They would all trade their existence in Kenya for a life like ours in Dublin – a muzungu (white personâ€™s) life.

The writer, based in the Irish capital Dublin, is an executive with the Vodafone telecommunications company who is on a 12-month sabbatical to help children in one Kenyan community. Her arrival in Kenya preceded the outbreak of deadly post-election violence that has ravaged the once-stable nation and brought it to the brink of despair.

KARANGASEM

A DIGGER driver at a Karagasem quarry died on Sunday after a cliff collapsed, burying him under 10 metres of rubble.

Ketut Rusdana, 45, from Sebudi Village was using the machine to move material at the quarry when the accident happened. Police believe the collapse occurred after recent heavy rain had made the cliffs surrounding the quarry unstable. Several other workers had narrow escapes from the falling rubble.

Due to the depth at which Rusdana and his machine were buried, it took police, quarry workers and local villagers around three hours to dig him out, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Police say the immediate cause of death is likely to have been a severe head injury.

Syamsul Hayat of Karangasem Police said on Sunday that negligence was the probable cause of the accident.

“Given the condition of the cliff, workers ought to have been careful. We’ve checked a number of eyewitnesses and the incident could probably be considered a workplace accident,” Hayat said, adding that police were investigating.

The Sebudi quarry was the scene of another recent fatal accident when falling rocks killed a truck driver.

Firearm Found on Foreign Boat

BENOA

POLICE and harbour officials at Benoa impounded a British-registered boat after an illegal firearm was found onboard.

According to sources at the harbour, quoted by local media, an American-made Mossberg rifle and 50 bullets were seized by police following a standard customs inspection after the boat docked last Friday afternoon.

Police have not yet revealed the identities or nationalities of those arrested.

Police spokesman I Gusti Putu Ayu said on Sunday that investigations were ongoing.

“If this is proven, then it will be a transnational crime, as the indications are that the people involved are of various nationalities,” he said.

Drugs Activist Dies

MENGWI

The coordinator of the charity IKON Bali, which worked for the rights and rehabilitation of drug users on the island, I Gusti Ngurah Wahyunda, died at Sanglah Hospital, Denpasar, on Friday.

The 31-year-old activist, himself a former drug addict, is thought to have died of complications from tuberculosis.

Wahyunda was the main leader of IKON and was instrumental in its work to build solidarity amongst recovering drug users and HIV sufferers in Bali, and to campaign for their human rights, pressing courts to order rehabilitation rather than jail time for convicted users.

The organisation also works with other NGOs on healthcare and needle exchange projects for addicts.

Wahyunda’s cremation was held at his home village of Denkayu Delodan, Mengwi, on Sunday, and was attended by many members of the IKON community.

Gung Kik, a former drug addict who attended the funeral, said that Wahyunda’s work had made him a role model for other recovering drug users.

“Through his actions and his life he made me believe that no matter how many times we fell down we would have the power to stand up again,” he said.

Wahyunda is survived by an 11-year-old son.

Illegal Arak Seized

DENPASAR

FOLLOWING the deaths of two men who drank tainted home-brewed arak (rice wine) last week, police raided several retail premises in South Bali on Friday and seized quantities of illegal alcohol.

The men who died – and around two dozen others who were hospitalised – had bought arak in Klungkung regency, but as part of an island-wide response police in Denpasar and Badung also acted against vendors of traditional alcohol.

On Friday evening officers raided a shop belonging to Nengah Puriantini, 38, on Jl Kenyeri, Denpasar.

“There we seized a jerry can filled with 15 litres of arak made without a license,” a police spokesman said.

A later raid was conducted at another shop on the same street belonging to 32-year-old Wayan Artana. Eleven mineral water bottles filled with illegally brewed arak were seized.

Meanwhile another shop in Abiansemal Village, Badung, was raided and a further two litres of homebrewed arak seized. The shop belonged to I Nyoman Alit, 30.

All three vendors were arrested and the alcohol held as evidence.



Bird-brained Burglar

BADUNG

A JEWELLERY thief surprised by the owners of the Badung house he had just burgled as he was making his getaway on Saturday escaped after telling them that he had been in the building looking for a missing caged bird. The man was later caught by police.

Ketut Agus Adi Putra, a 19-year-old student from Abiansemal, broke into the house belonging to AA Yudi Arnawa, 53, and AA Dewi Indrayati, 50, close to his own home in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The owners were absent at the time, but returned as Putra was leaving. According to a police spokesman the couple were suspicious, but were initially convinced by the intruder’s story.

“Actually the perpetrator stole from the house while it was empty, but as he was leaving he ran into the owners. He pretended to be looking for a bird that had escaped. But once they’d checked inside they found all their jewellery had been stolen and they immediately suspected the perpetrator and reported to the police,” the spokesman said.

Gold rings and necklaces and sapphires with an estimated value of Rp123.5 million (US$13,460) were taken during the robbery. Putra was arrested later that day and remains in police custody.

THE Diary had a delightful outing the other day – a marriage ceremony in rural Karangasem that precisely demonstrated the magic of Bali and why it is so much better to live here than just visit. The happy couple – already married in the Balinese custom by virtue of an initial ceremony in 2005 – was completing the process at the bride’s home village. Their two-year-daughter was along for the ride (as well as 20-plus partygoers who travelled by bus from Tabanan for the occasion).

What made the occasion so special for The Diary (and Mrs. Diary) was that the bride was their former housekeeper, a young woman who is a friend as well as a former employee. It is these personal links that add so much to life in Bali.

The Diary’s thoughts on this occasion turned to the sterile and dismissive advice (immediately rejected) of a former short-term associate, also an expatriate who lives in Bali and does some business here, who a long time ago, observing that the young couple were friends with “visiting privileges” at their home, said he never got that close.

What a parched existence such “disengaged” expats must live. They refuse see the real value of Balinese life, will not share in the joys and sadness of it, and as a result deny themselves everything that makes the island what it is. You wonder why they’re here, really, other than to enjoy the cut-price benefits of their ersatz bling and bolly scene and to gouge some money.

Ask Not For Whom the Bell Tolls

IT TOLLS for them, apparently. Australia’s fiery tragedy in the southern state of Victoria has drawn condolences from around the world – from Queen Elizabeth (still incongruously monarch of that southern realm), from President Barack Obama, from the leaders of Germany, Singapore, Timor Leste and many other nations. And Indonesia? Well, the consul-general in Melbourne delivered a letter of condolence to Victoria’s state premier (and that’s great) and says Indonesia is preparing to send a forensic team to help with victim identification. But from Jakarta itself? Nothing heard: Not from President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono; not from Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda.

Australia’s population is 22 million. The fire toll will certainly exceed 200 lives (it may yet be many more). That’s the equivalent per capita of 2,000 people if the disaster had happened in Indonesia – a measure of the relative impact of the disaster on Australia. Even on the actual numbers, it exceeds the frightful toll from the first Bali bombing. Ding!

Incidentally, The Diary heard from a mate in Canberra the other day, a chap who runs a very successful public relations outfit in Australia’s centre of government. He was asking people to donate blood to assist hospitals cope with the large number of burns victims – noting that he used to donate blood regularly but hadn’t, for all sorts of reasons, done so in recent years. The tragedy had brought him back to the realization that everyone needs to help. The Diary would help if possible, but distance makes that difficult. But top marks, Mark Croxford, for civic thinking.

They’ll be Banning Apples Next

FRESH from their triumphant banning of yoga and not-quite-banning smoking – good luck there, guys – the luminaries who seek to remove from modern Indonesia all sorts of things (some beneficial, some not, but all elective human behavior) that offend their reading of Islam’s requirements have now set their sights on service clubs.

Specifically, they assert that Rotary and Lions – the voluntary associations that do so much charity work not only in Indonesia but around the world – are Zionist fronts associated with Freemasonry. The focus at the moment is on Bandung, the pleasant hill town in Java which, among other achievements, held the 1955 conference that started the Non-Aligned Movement as a force in world affairs. According to Athian Ali Muhammad Da’i of the Forum Ulama Ummat Indonesia, there are two Freemason-Zionist clubs in Bandung, West Java, they being the Rotary Club and the Lions Club.

He says that in 2001 the Attorney General’s Office told him these Zionist entities operating in the city raised money that was sent to America and thence to Israel. He has asked President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to reinstate presidential edict No. 264 of 1962, which outlawed the Rotary Club in Indonesia.

He adds that fatwas issued by clerics in Mecca and the Egyptian Al-Azhar Fatwa Commission stated that any Muslim who joined either the Rotary Club or Lions Club thereby became a kafir, or infidel. Here is yet another case of Indonesian Muslims being encouraged by mistaken assumptions among the more fundamentalist-minded of their leaders to adopt views from very far away that have little to do with Indonesia and nothing at all to do with common sense.

Both Rotary and Lions in Indonesia run valuable health and social improvement programs that directly benefit poor Indonesians who would otherwise not get – for example – cranio-facial surgery to correct disfiguring conditions, clean water or dental care. What next? Perhaps the Forum Ulama Ummat Indonesia will seek ban the infidel practice of growing apples for commercial profit, something else that was brought to Indonesia to the healthful benefit of the people.

Weak End at Bernie’s

BERNIE Madoff, whose headline-grabbing US$50 billion Wall Street fraud starkly demonstrates the fundamental moral collapse of American financial ethics, lists among the (unquestionably stupid) victims of his multibillion-dollar fraud top Hollywood stars (Kevin Bacon, who clearly won’t be bringing any home, and John Malkovich, who can’t be very pleased with being himself); Larry Silverstein, the man rebuilding the World Trade Center; veteran CNN talk show host Larry King; and baseball luminary Fred Wilpon, who owns the New York Mets.

The list at the US Bankruptcy Court in New York shows thousands of people invested with Madoff before his arrest in December and the collapse of his alleged multi-billion dollar sucker scheme. Other prominent victims include some of the world’s leading financial institutions: UBS, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, BNP Paribas and Citigroup. A string of museums, charities and pension funds are also listed.

Bernie didn’t just sting strangers. The 162-page list contains many of those closest to the 70-year-old Madoff. His wife Ruth appears, as do their sons and Madoff’s brother. Following his arrest, Madoff was able to enlist only his wife and brother to back his $10 million bail, which was subsequently tightened to full house arrest in Manhattan. His lawyer, Ira Sorkin, also appears on the list.

He has not yet been indicted In America these things can take a very long time. Although maybe not as long if your lawyer is smarting.



Apa Kabar, Ibu Hillary?

THE world spotlight will be on Indonesia next week when new US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visits us on her first overseas trip. Her spokesman says she wants to “reach out” to the Muslim world and Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, is “an important country for the United States.”

President Barack Obama himself, who as everyone now knows spent some of his childhood in Indonesia and has been hanging for a really nice nasi goreng ever since, has tagged Indonesia as a great place to visit. Hey, Mr. President, Visit Indonesia Year was last year! But he’ll be along shortly, count on it.

Secretary Clinton (seen in our photo practicing her Hi and Bye Wave) will meet senior officials in Jakarta on Feb. 18-19, immediately after a stop in Japan, to discuss “the close and growing partnership with Indonesia and developing matters of common interest in South-East Asia.” From here she will go on to South Korea and China.



Fancy a Sheikh-down Cruise?

WE’RE not sure whether it’s just fate making bad timing of an otherwise great idea, or if the oil-rich Gulf States really are recession-proof. But Abu Dhabi’s first international yacht show – as in, one for the mega-mega super-yachts – gets under way next month and by all accounts will a global showstopper. The promoters even ask: “Tired of the Mediterranean?” And answer their own question: “Abu Dhabi is the new hotspot for super-yacht enthusiasts.”

The show – it’s on from March 12-14 – capitalizes on massive infrastructure investment in the Gulf, of the sort that accommodates the floating gin palaces of the super rich and really famous, and spins off the area’s reputation as a place that combines history and the future. It’s a big pitch, certainly at the moment when the market in super yachts may be down just a tad as the suddenly not quite so mega rich count their pennies. But the organizers, themselves apparently refugees from the suddenly poorer Med where they also organize the regular Monaco shindig, seem happy enough to be spruiking the new show.

We hope the Abu Dhabi show is a huge success – and that the flow of investment funds from the Gulf in the general direction of Indonesia will not dry up in a rush. It would be even better if this funding fully focused on building a productive future instead of re-inventing history.

Just a thought: If things do eventually go belly-up, and the world’s super-yacht fleet is reduced to a responsible number (one or two seems appropriate), our very own Benoa Harbor might just manage to squeeze them in.



Flustered Feathers

SINCE your Diarist takes a close interest in birds – well, he would, wouldn’t he; ones of the avian variety, of course – it is disturbing to hear news that the Java hawk-eagle may be in trouble because of its well publicized endangered status and its high-profile role, courtesy of former President Suharto, who in 1993 named it Indonesia’s national rare animal. This seems to have attracted the attention not only of conservationists and legitimate collectors, but also of illegal bird traders.

Chris Shepherd, of the Malaysian based wildlife body TRAFFIC, says that over the last 20 years 70 Java hawk-eagles have been recorded in trade, most of them in recent times. It is regarded as one of the world’s rarest birds and is highly sought after for zoos and private collections. But it has never been bred in captivity.

Nisaetus bartelsi – the scientific name commemorates Hans Bartels – is clearly in need of greater protection. As Shepherd notes, raising the profile and awareness of threatened wildlife needs to go hand in hand with effective laws to protect the species concerned. In other words, the Java hawk-eagle doesn’t need a PR campaign as much as it needs real interest in its fate, coupled with official determination to ensure its survival.

Yes, Well, Just Don’t Drown

DOMINQUE Strauss-Kahn, the euphoniously named French head of the International Monetary Fund, apparently likes to be frank. Perhaps he finds it a bit of light relief, given that in his homeland the euro long since replaced that other franc.

Conceding that most nations would inevitably see an increase in public debt from measures to avert catastrophe and that the world had to deal with the crisis before addressing the recovery, he added this little bon-mot: “When you have a fire in the house, you first need to put out the fire and then you see how you evacuate the excess water.”

DSK, as he is sometimes known, is one for hot water himself, being French. Last year he narrowly escaped the otherwise likely consequences of being sprung on a one-night-stand with an IMF employee, a lady who – as that delightful old phrase puts it – was not his wife. His wife, apparently culturally attuned to la vie amoureuse francais, said she understood.

Departing Soon: Rumor Airlines

OUR eye was caught this week by a curious item in the regular Bali Update put out by Bali Discovery Tours. It said Australian aviation sources reported Brisbane-based airline SkyAirWorld was planning 14 flights a week between Darwin and Bali. We assume they meant return seven services a week. Even so, the schedule seemed, shall we say, somewhat brave, given you could just about squeeze Darwin’s entire population into Kuta on a Saturday night.

SkyAirWorld operates company charter and limited scheduled services with Embraer jets in Queensland and also flies Brisbane-Solomon Islands. The Bali Update report suggested the airline was also about to start services from Darwin to Dili in Timor Leste. Well, in relation to Bali, we shall see. Given Garuda couldn’t sell a seat out of Brisbane (city and surrounding population 2 million-plus) and had to cancel its proposed service before it started, plus Pacific Blue’s and JetStar’s existing services, it looks a little like a flight of fancy. SkyAirWorld tells us no announcements have been made.",{},"['diary', 'worlds', 'bali', 'indonesia', 'world', 'president', 'times', 'java', 'week', 'wife', 'rotary']","It is these personal links that add so much to life in Bali.
