Drug â€˜can greatly reduce risk of HIV infectionâ€™,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Khaama Press,25-11-2010,The Khaama Press News Agency,"A drug used to treat HIV-positive patients may offer gay and bisexual men some protection against contracting the virus, the authors of a new study say. Trials of the combination drug Truvada among nearly 2,500 men suggested it could reduce the chances of male-to-male HIV infection by 44%. Those using the drug regularly could further reduce the risk of infection, it was claimed. The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Pills and condoms Truvada is the trade name of a drug manufactured by the California-based company Gilead Sciences Inc which combines two antiretroviral drugs, used to treat Aids. But this new study looks at whether it could be used to prevent HIV infection in the first place. Almost 2,500 gay or bisexual men were randomly selected in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand and the United States. Half were given the pill, half were given dummy tablets. All the men were also given condoms and counselling on safe sex. What the researchers found after about a year of testing was that the drug appeared to cut male-to-male HIV transmission by 44%, when the group taking the pill was compared with the placebo group. Those who took the pill regularly were deemed to have reduced their risk of infection further, by up to 73%, and blood tests were run to confirm this relationship between pill-usage and protection levels. The research was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the federal US body, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The pills were donated by their manufacturer. NIAID director, Dr Anthony Fauci, conceded more work needed to be done, but called the results impressive. â€œThis has been done in men who have sex with men. We need to know if we get similar results in women as well as in heterosexual men, which we have reason to believe we will,â€� he told the BBC. â€œWe also need to get a long term view of were there any toxicities. We didnâ€™t see anything that was significant but we need to follow that for a long period of time.â€� Questions and concerns The trial does of course raise questions and concerns. Is it possible, for instance, that the results were skewed by greater condom use in the group that took the pill; and wonâ€™t such findings encourage some men to dispense with condoms altogether in favour of a drug? There is also the issue of prohibitive cost of Truvada, which retails in the US for around $36 a day, and which makes the drug unaffordable to many possible users. Dr Fauci argues that the two groups were fully randomised and says that drugs can only play a complementary role in the war on HIV. Condoms and fewer partners, he said, remain the first line of defence. â€œWeâ€™re hoping that if this does become a useable tool in prevention, then the associated counselling will complement the effect of the drug and stop people becoming cavalier about it and say â€˜now I have a pill I donâ€™t have to worryâ€™. â€œThatâ€™s exactly the opposite of what we want to happen. We want to add something rather than have it replace something.â€� Sir Nick Partridge, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, called the trial results â€œpotentially significantâ€�. â€œItâ€™s vital that we expand the ways we can prevent HIV transmission, particularly amongst those most at risk,â€� he said in a statement. â€œThis trial proves that HIV treatment will have an impact on prevention, but that itâ€™s not ready for widespread use yet. â€œThree major hurdles are still going to be its cost, the risks of drug-resistant strains of HIV developing and taking a drug treatment every day.â€� _____________________ Source: BBC",{},"['drug', 'reduce', 'infection', 'results', 'used', 'men', 'trial', 'risk', 'study', 'hiv', 'pill', 'greatly']","A drug used to treat HIV-positive patients may offer gay and bisexual men some protection against contracting the virus, the authors of a new study say.

Though women of other nationalities, including Vietnam, Thailand and Sri Lankans, still lead the successful sex trade in Singapore, Wang said Chinese like her had pushed many of them out of business. Jia which means (good) in Chinese language said a country woman named Wen Won, who worked as a prostitute in Geylang and Orchard rood two famous red light areas in Singapore, encouraged her to join the field. On Orchard road, the success story of Singaporeansâ€™ development, in a half dark cafÃ©, In a pinky sexy short, with a half naked body Jia is completely covered by cigarettes smoke. â€œMy first customer paid me SGD 250 to accompany him overnight. He even took me on a night tour of Santosa. The following customers were not as good as him. They treated me like a tool to satisfy their sexual desires and that made me feel terrible,â€� she said. She said her last customer paid her just to chat with her, saying that he wanted to gather information to write a book. â€œHe gave me a book and advised me to quit the job. I couldnâ€™t control myself and started crying,â€� she said. â€œI told him that Iâ€™m â€˜too dirtyâ€™ now and that my future is already gone,â€� she said. Today is international sex workersâ€™ day â€“ a day to bring attention to the more than often exploitative conditions that those working in the industry have to face. Whatâ€™s the best way to protect sex workers and prevent sexual exploitation that is a question which is very hard to governments to answer it. According to the international labor organization ( ILO) annually the income from forced labors reached the level of $ 150 billion . And prostitution business has a oily part in that income. ILO says that $150 billion in profits by 21 million forced laborers around the world. You have many countries in the world, whose population and GDP do not even match these figures. We are talking about a vast nation of hidden people about whom we are not talking enough and about whom the time has come to take strong action. Jia Wong is also a member of this huge family which is involved in prostitution business in that part of the world. She said she was misused by others and now she is victim of that business and doesnâ€™t know how to leave that field . She said she began regretting her act and she was worried that she might be infected with HIV because she said before I start that business I had no idea what is HIV and how dangerous is it for our life. As a journalist when I first came to Singapore, I was a bit confused about prostitution. I thought it was illegal based on what little I knew about coming here. We heard that Singapore has a strong government; I assumed it would be tightly controlled. However, after just a few weeks of living here and driving around at night, I soon learned the truth. Even the government is not care about how the young generation of this county is going to be in contact with HIV infected girls from poor south eastern Asian countries. â€œThe government of Singapore, a country which means the country of lion knows that, they are lions they want to do business and attract more tourist to this countryâ€� she said. There is dozens of prostitutes from several souths eastern countries in that read light district in Singapore this night, but nobody knows exactly how many chineâ€™s women like Jia have been sold into sexual slavery. Some girls like Jia are cheated by pimps and sold to traffickers. Others are abducted, raped and psychologically pummeled into submission. As music blared from the loudspeakers in the dimly-lit cafe in Gylang area Jiaâ€™s cell phone rang.

Russian president criticize ISAF over Afghan drug production,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Meena Haseeb,09-05-2013,The Khaama Press News Agency,"Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday criticized NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) over drug production in Afghanistan and said the alliance has not taken necessary steps to eradicate the production of opium in the country, which will boost drug-trafficking in the near future. While speaking during the Russian Security Council on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin accused NATO for being failed in bringing stability to the region as the coalition security forces are preparing to withdraw its combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Putin quoted by Russia Today (RT) News said, There are all grounds to believe that we may face an escalation of the situation in Afghanistan in the short term.â€� He said, â€œThe foreign military contingent, whose backbone is American forces, has not achieved a breakthrough in the fight against terrorist and radical groups as yet. On the contrary, their activity has been particularly increasing lately.â€� There has also been â€œa drastic increase in drug production in the territory of Afghanistan and the creation of stable drug-trafficking routes to other countries, including â€“ unfortunately â€“ to Russia,â€� he said. Putin also noted that the ISAF does little to address the problem, while Russiaâ€™s proposals on the matter have so far been ignored. Russia remains highly concerned about the persistant threat of terrorism and drug trafficking from Afghanistan, particularly after international combat troops leave in 2014. According to Russiaâ€™s federal drug control watchdog, heroin production in Afghanistan rose 40-fold in the past decade. In the meantime Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavros called on International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to reports on the results of its mission after its withdrawa from Afghanistan in 2014.",{},"['drug', 'afghan', 'criticize', 'isaf', 'afghanistan', 'international', 'vladimir', 'russian', 'troops', 'president', 'putin', 'security', 'production']","Russian president Vladimir Putin on Wednesday criticized NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) over drug production in Afghanistan and said the alliance has not taken necessary steps to eradicate the production of opium in the country, which will boost drug-trafficking in the near future.

Youth addiction grows parallel with drug production in Afghanistan,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Meena Haseeb,29-05-2013,The Khaama Press News Agency,"By: Noor Gul Shafaq â€œI am happy to die rather than to be alive. If you wish bad-luck to your enemy wish him to become addicted to opium or heroin, as there is no other greater punishment rather than being addicted.â€� This is what Noor Mohammad said from Kapisa Province Afghanistan . Noor has been using opium since 12 years. He is the oldest among his brothers, and is beaten and shackled several time to quit using drugs by his Youngers bother, who are now taking care of their family. â€œQuitting drugs is something out my hands now.â€� Says Noor. As Noor, nearly one million youth in Afghanistan have lit fire to their lives being addicted to Heroin, Opium and to others drugs. They go to Pakistan and particularly Iran for work, and return addicted to drugs. This young man, wearing reddish jean look clean than the others. He has gone to Iran for job, but instead addicted to opium by his friends. He is now smoking heroin, and says. â€œHis family doesnâ€™t know about him smoking heroin.â€� â€œI leaves home every day pretends I am going to find a paid job but when I come here I use drugs.â€� Mohammad Gul, from Kapisa Province , who once was not even smoking cigarettes but become addicted to Heroin at Iran by his roommates. He says. â€œA friends offered me a cigarette without letting me know it was Heroin not tobacco in the cigarettes. Since then I am addicted to drugs. I fell pain all over my body if I donâ€™t use drugs now. In Iran suing Drugs is a tradition.â€� The known reasons behind youth addiction to drug in Afghanistan are unemployment, wars, and familyâ€™s problems. Baba Jan has also left Afghanistan to Iran in hope of a good job. During work hours friends were proposing him poppy for extra energy to work extra hours and would be able to earn more money. He did so as his friendsâ€™ proposed. After returning to Afghanistan his wife noticed that her husband is addicted to drugs. She divorced and left here two children to him as well. A big number of youth have also become addicted to drugs inside Afghanistan . Sarfaraz and Rahmatullah from Helmand province. They call Helmand as drugsâ€™ capital and producing Factory. They have also become addicted in Helmand, and for drugsâ€™ introduction to youth in Helmand blaming those who have been returned from Iran to Helmand Base on a research the Deputy Chief of UNODC in Kabul Ashita Mittal says: â€œAfghanistan is producing 80% â€“ 90% of the worldâ€™s opium and itâ€™s per sure what ever country cultivate drug the residents of that country will be using it as well.â€� She adds: â€œEven though 4.6 Million refugees have been returned to Afghanistan but it doesnâ€™t mean whoever have been to other country they return addicted.â€� According to the addicted youthsâ€™ information they are paying AFN 150 for one packet of Opium. Where are those money coming from? Most people believes drugs users are thieves. One of the addicted, Baba Jan says: â€œToday I stole AFN 100 to buy opium or heroin, I just smoked it and have diminish my body pain with, and before I was stilling a blanket everyday valued AFN 1,200 from my home and was selling it for AFN 300 â€“ 400.â€� â€œI borrow money from a friend and I also work.â€� Said Gul Mohammad. Another one who did not want to be identified said. â€œNo one give us a job, so we have no others option, but to rob. I use, sell and buy heroin now, this is what I am doing as my business nowâ€�. At Kabul Drugs dealers and users are based at Bagh-E-Ali Mardan, Pul-E-Sukhta and at some others locations. They have also built their own living spaces at the desiccated parts of Kabul â€™s river. That is where they cover their faces with scarfs, using drugs and sleeping on top of garbage. Murad Khani Bridge is just about a Kilometer away from the presidential palace, last year few addicted were flood-died here. One of the drug userâ€™s brother Zabiullah says: â€œHe has treated his brother several time but he is reusing, while he sees others using it and itâ€™s also very easy to find.â€� He was criticizing the government for not being so active to prevent drugsâ€™ deals in the city. Dr. Tawfiq Mashal, Director of Drug Prevention Ministry of Public Health says: â€œThey have 105 drug usersâ€™ treatment centers countrywide and 28 out of those are located in Kabul . All those centers have the capacity of treating 20,800 persons per year. Will 105 drugs usersâ€™ treatment centers have the capacity to treat one million drug users? This might be the case people like Gul Mohammad who wants to be treated, donâ€™t even know if the centers are exists or it might not be his turn yet. â€œWhere are the drugs usersâ€™ centers located, I want to be treated there?â€� Asked Gul Mohammad Ashita Mittal, the Deputy Head of UNODC Kabul Office Said. â€œWe have conducted an assessment together with two others Organizations, UNHCR and IOM at Kabul , Parwan, Jowz Jan, Baghlan and Hearat Provinces and here is the basic result of the assessment. First 30,000 of the returnees are addicted to Heroin. Second 8,000 are using injections and out of the eight thousands 2,000 share injections witch is the key reason for HIV transmitting.â€� She says: â€œ7% of those drugs users who are using and sharing injections are affected by HIV at Kabul , Heart and Mazar-E-Shrif provinces.â€� She further adds: â€œBase on a research 10% out of around one millions addicted have access to drugs usersâ€™ treatment centers and 2.3% of under age 15 are addicted to opium.â€� During a ribbon cutting ceremony held a while ago at Jangalak area of Kabul for a 300 beds refurbished drug addicted treatment Center . Kareem Khalili the voice president of the country called youthsâ€™ addication a silent tsunami. Numbers of drugsâ€™ addicted are now under treatment in this center and Sarfarz from Helmand is one of them who had no other option but to come to the treatment center. He adds: â€œbeing under treatment in the center has given him a new life.â€� I left Jangalak to a privet addicted treatment center (Nejat). When I moved in to the building, I heard noise coming out of a room, and noticed that someone is singing and others are clapping for. When I moved closer the singer was singing (oh youth, oh youth, stop using drugs, if there are no youths who will be building this country) some of them ware clapping and the others were dancing. Talking to one of them who was pretty happy with the centerâ€™s services, Doctorsâ€™ and trainersâ€™ behaviors. â€œNow if I became sad, I am not heading to back drugs I am staying here for entertaining and learning some skills.â€� Said Peer Dil. The Doctor incharge of the center Tariq Sulaiman says. â€œWe are not only treating the addicted but teaching them some vocational skills as well, and then sending them back to their families.â€� Dr. Tariq added. â€œWe have even recruited some of the addicted after curing in the center but the most important thing before the treatment is good behaviors to win their hearts.â€� The Ministry of Labors, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MoLSAMD) authorities say: â€œThe Ministry has brought together 943 drugs users since last year by 9 drugs users collecting campaigns. They either have been send back to their families or have been introduced to vocational institutes for trainingâ€�. According to Dr. Inayatullah Mayel the Executive Director of National Skills Development Program (NSDP), there are lots of requests and expectations with limited availabilities. Eng. Zabi ullah, an Advisor to the Ministry of Counter Narcotics say: â€œFor civic Education purposes about drugsâ€™ drawbacks, we have added a subject to the Ministry of Education curriculum.â€� He also adds: â€œ90% of opium have been producing at Helmand, Kandahar, Farah and Urzgan Provinces while others 10% are coming from Dai Konde, Badghis, Nimroz and some others provinces of the country.â€� â€œYearly investment range on drugs trafficking is in between USD 65 â€“ 70 Billion worldwide.â€� Said Zabi Ullah Lieutenant general Abdul Khalil Bakhtyar, the General Director of Counter Narcotics Ministry of Interior Affairs said. â€œAround 3 million people are involved in drug trafficking across the country and meanwhile opium cultivation has been eradicated in 17 provinces and 8 out of 10 top drugsâ€™ traffickers have been arrested last year.â€� He further added: â€œCurrently, 3,000 drugs traffickers are detained at Pul-E-Charkhi prison.â€� In the Afghan society addicted have not been respected very well. People have been beating them, throwing stone at them and insulting them. Gul Mohammad is complaining from his family and Says: â€œBefore being addicted I was well respected at home, whenever I would have not liked the food already prepared at home I reject eating it and was asking my mom for a different kinds of food and she was serving it me.â€� â€œSince Iâ€™ve been using drugs no one from my family is treating me as a human beingâ€� Said Gul Mohammad. Professor Sharafuddin Azimi, lecturer of Psychology Faculty at Kabul University says. â€œDrug Users are sick, the need to be well treated by their family and if we want them to stop using drugs we should treat them with love.â€� Mohammad Hotak, had used heroin for 10 years and now he is not using it anymore and requesting the others addicted to quit using drugs because drugs disrespects peoplesâ€™ personalities among friends, families and in the society. According to Hotak, they should just come up with a strong plan and must go to the treatment center to stop using drugs. A UNODC research indicates 154000 hectares arable land estimated in 2012 for poppy cultivation and it has increased to 18% compared to the last year. 95% of poppies cultivation took place at insecure southern 9 provinces of the country. The research also shows that 64% of the worldâ€™s poppy cultivation in 2012 has took place in Afghanistan . Note: addicted people interviewed are between ages 20 â€“ 35 years.

"10,500 people die from tuberculosis every year in Afghanistan",The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Administrator,03-12-2012,The Khaama Press News Agency,"By: Ahmad Masoud According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 53,000 people contract tuberculosis (TB) every year in Afghanistan. The available figures indicate that 66 percent of new cases are women and 10 percent are children. WHO has said that more than 670 children younger than 15 were diagnosed with TB last year in Afghanistan and, of those, the majority of the cases, 465, were girls. The Afghan Ministry of Public Health has reported that nearly 10,500 people die from TB each year in the country and nearly 650 children succumbed to the disease last year. Experts believe that poor working and living conditions, poverty, traditional beliefs, lack of awareness about the disease, security, lack of access to proper medications and health facilities for an earlier diagnosis of the disease and intervention are among the reasons for the high incidence of tuberculosis. The internationally-recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS), which is believed to be the most efficient and cost-effective tuberculosis control strategy, has been used in Afghanistan with some success. The implementation of DOTS requires sustained political and financial commitment to ensure that there can be: diagnosis by quality ensured sputum-smear microscopy; standardized short-course anti-TB treatment (SSC) given under direct and supportive observation (DOT); a regular, uninterrupted supply of high quality anti-TB drugs; and a standardized recording and reporting mechanism. According to available figures, the percentage of people with access to DOTS in Afghanistan has increased from 14 to 97 percent since 2002 and the number of health facilities which apply DOTS has increased from 10 in 2000 to nearly 1,200 in 2011. Based on the DOTS successes, the WHO developed a six-point â€˜Stop TB Strategyâ€™ to address the key challenges faced by TB worldwide. The main purpose of the strategy is to lessen the global TB burden by 2015 and ensure that all TB patients and those co-infected with HIV and drug-resistant TB take advantage of universal access to high-quality diagnosis and patient-centred treatment. The six-point â€˜Stop TB Strategyâ€™ includes sustaining, improving and accelerating quality DOTS expansion; addressing TB-HIV, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and other special challenges; contributing to health system strengthening; engaging all care providers; empowering patients and communities; and enabling and promoting research. Keeping in mind the current threat posed by TB in Afghanistan, experts suggest that more priority should be given to a carefully-designed national TB communication strategy based on the six-point â€˜Stop TB Strategyâ€™ in Afghanistan. The communication objective should be clear whether it wants to raise awareness about the danger of TB; promote TB safe behaviour among those who are aware of the dangers of TB or promote TB safe behaviour among a group of people who are at particular risk. The comprehensive communication strategy needs to be based on the results of well designed research, using Knowledge, Attitude, Practices and Beliefs (KAPB), Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) research methods. Specials attention should be given to rural areas where the majority of the population live and where the level of understanding of TB is very low. An overall majority of people in Afghanistan do not know the early signs and symptoms of TB and think that it is an incurable disease. Meanwhile, any research to be conducted in the country will need to pay special attention to women and girls who make up the majority of the TB cases in Afghanistan and are traditionally responsible, in certain parts of the country, for working in some unhygienic environments such as stables, pens, backyards, and collecting and bringing home firewood, bushes and animal droppings. They are also responsible for cooking, washing and taking care of other household chores and all these could make them more prone to the disease. Despite TB eradication efforts, Afghanistan has remained one of the 22 TB high-burden countries in the world. The alarming figures indicate that Afghanistan has a long way to go before getting rid of this preventable disease.",{},"['research', 'tb', 'afghanistan', 'die', 'strategy', 'sixpoint', '10500', 'stop', 'tuberculosis', 'disease', 'majority', 'dots', 'health']","By: Ahmad MasoudAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 53,000 people contract tuberculosis (TB) every year in Afghanistan.

"Girl, 8, married to 12-year-old boy against $2000 in Balkh",The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Ahmad Shah Ghanizada,31-08-2014,The Khaama Press News Agency,"By: Mirwais Jalalzai At age 8, Mina married to 12 -year-old Sardar in a rural village, making her only one of more than 10 million underage girls who are being forced to wed worldwide. The secret wedding ceremony of Mina and Sardar took place in Sholgara district of northern Balkh province in the border with Tajikistan. Child marriages, which are currently, practiced in several third world countries including Afghanistan, the government passed strong resolution to stop this phenomenon. United Nations designated October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child to forced governments to take strong steps against child marriage. Last night Afghan media broadcast series of heart-breaking photos depicting girl as young as eight years old being married off to a underage boy . In the district of Sholgara of Balkh province, a father named Abdul Momin gave away his eight-year-old daughter Mina to wed a 12-year old boy because he could not support having his daughter live with him. According to reports the groom family paid 2000 USD to brideâ€™s father as the girlâ€™s price (Mahar). Afghan experts agree that early marriage prevents the girls from education opportunities and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by growing responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. Mina, the 8-year-old bride from Balkh province who was married off on Friday, was forced to drop out of school, giving up on her dream of becoming a teacher one day. In several part of Afghanistan fathers often remove their daughter from school even before they are engaged to limit their interactions with boys. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. The local Mula Imam (religious leader) who was attended in Nekah ceremony said both families mutually agree and enter into this contract; both bride and groom have the liberty to define various terms and conditions of their liking and make them a part of this contract. â€œThere is no ban for under age marriage in special conditions in Islamâ€� he said. The forced marriages of girls to under or middle-aged men are not only common in Afghanistan, but also other countries like India and Ethiopia (South-Asia and sub-Saharan Africa more broadly). Every year, 10 million girls around the world are forced into marriage before they turn 18. Girls who marry young â€“ as well as missing out on education â€“ are more likely to suffer poverty, domestic violence, malnutrition, maternal and infant death, obstetric fistula and HIV infection. Mina was just a little girl. She probably enjoyed playing outside with her siblings. She probably loved her parents â€“ and did not understand why they sold her into marriage. A marriage that turned out to be her death, and at best would have still meant the end of her life as she knew it. Almost 39,000 girls around the world face the same possible fate as Mina every single day. Thatâ€™s 39,000 tragic weddings that are far from a fairy tale. Although child marriage is against the law in many countries even in Afghanistan, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimates that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret. In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 per cent of girls wed before the legal age of 16 according to UN investigations.",{},"['afghanistan', 'girl', '12yearold', 'forced', 'world', 'girls', 'marriage', 'age', 'married', 'province', 'boy', 'mina', 'balkh', '2000', 'young']","The secret wedding ceremony of Mina and Sardar took place in Sholgara district of northern Balkh province in the border with Tajikistan.

UNODC chief met President Karzai on counter-narcotics action,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Sajad,29-05-2012,The Khaama Press News Agency,"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) following a press release on Tuesday announced, Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of UNODC and Afghan President Hamid Karzai today discussed plans to boost national and regional counter-narcotics efforts, as well as ways to stem drug production. The source further added, stressing the principle of â€œshared responsibilityâ€� as the only effective answer to the global menace of Afghan opiates, Mr. Fedotov highlighted that the Afghan Government and provincial governors had a crucial role to play. Strong, sustained political will at all levels of the Afghan leadership would be an essential part of the solution. Mr. Fedotov said, â€œI welcome the fact that the government is working hard to counter the narcotics trade in the country, but there is also a need to do much more. We must build the necessary political commitment, as well as practical action, to have tangible successes against the criminal networks that traffic in death and misery.â€� Afghanistan produces some 90 per cent of the worldâ€™s illicit opiates. The UNODC Afghan Opium Survey 2011 pointed to a dramatic 133 per cent increase in the farm-gate value of opium compared with 2010, higher prices for the crop and a flourishing drugs trade. Having launched a new Country Programme for Afghanistan (2012-2014) while in Kabul, Mr. Fedotov assured President Karzai that his Office remained committed to ensuring continued and tailored support to Afghanistan. Mr. Fedotov underscored the timeliness of the UNODC Country Programme, which was aligned with handover of power by the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF). The Country Programme represented a concrete step towards strengthening the capacity of the Government to fight illicit drugs and crime, which would pave the way for long-term development, he said. Its focus would primarily be on providing alternative livelihoods to households dependent on illicit crop cultivation; drug demand reduction; and drug-related HIV prevention and treatment. Simultaneously, the Country Programme would contribute to the wider objectives of the Regional Programme for Afghanistan and Neighbouring Countries 2011-14, a strategic framework for UNODC and multilateral partners to respond effectively to drug trafficking and organized crime.",{},"['drug', 'illicit', 'afghan', 'country', 'chief', 'fedotov', 'drugs', 'counternarcotics', 'unodc', 'crime', 'action', 'karzai', 'president', 'programme', 'mr', 'met']","United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) following a press release on Tuesday announced, Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of UNODC and Afghan President Hamid Karzai today discussed plans to boost national and regional counter-narcotics efforts, as well as ways to stem drug production.

World Population Tops 7 Billion,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Administrator,30-10-2011,The Khaama Press News Agency,"KABUL, 31 October 2011 â€“ The United Nations has predicted that the world population will reach 7 billion today. This global milestone is both a great opportunity and a great challenge. The challenges confronting humanity as the worldâ€™s population reaches 7 billion are presented in a new report by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund launched worldwide on October 26th. The State of World Population 2011: People and possibilities in a world of 7 billion shows that actions we take today could determine whether world population will grow to 10 billion or 16 billion by the end of the century, and could ensure that our future is more equitable and environmentally sustainable. â€œWith planning and the right investment in people now â€“ to empower them to make choices that are not only good for themselves, but also for our global commons â€“ our world of 7 billion can have thriving sustainable cities, productive labour forces that fuel economies, and youth populations that contribute to the well-being of their societies,â€� says UNFPA Executive Director Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin in the foreword of the report. This yearâ€™s State of World Population report, People and Possibilities in a World of 7 Billion, looks at the dynamics behind the numbers. It explains the trends that are defining our world of 7 billion and documents actions that people in vastly different countries and circumstances are taking in their own communities to make the most of theirâ€“and ourâ€“world. It is mainly a report from the field, where demographers, policymakers, governments, civil society and individuals are grappling with population trends ranging from ageing to rapidly rising numbers of young people, from high population growth rates to shrinking populations, and from high rates of urbanization to rising international migration. The countries featured in this report are China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, India, Mexico, Mozambique, Nigeria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The State of World Population 2011 report shows that the issue of population is a question of human equity and opportunity more than space. While our world of 7 billion presents a complex picture of trends and paradoxes, there are some essential global truths the report observed. It is relevant to note that educating and empowering girls and women allow them to have fewer children than their mothers and grandmothers did, and they choose this path whenever and wherever they can. It is also generally observed that boys and men must be consistently involved, for they are the critical partners for health and development. UNFPA Report states that additional investments in youth are needed. Of the worldâ€™s 7 billion, 1.8 billion are young people between the ages of 10 and 24. As parents and teachers of the next generation, their choices will determine future population trends. Investing in the health and education of youth would yield enormous returns in economic growth and development for generations to come. â€œIn Afghanistan people less than 25 years old make up almost 70 percent of the total population. Investing in adolescent girls is one of the smartest investments a country can make. With health, education and opportunities, girls and women can contribute fully to their societies and help break the cycle of poverty. To celebrate the 7 billion possibilities behind the 7 billion people of this world, UNFPA stands close to Afghan womenâ€™s right to a safe and healthy motherhoodâ€�, said Arie Hoekman, UNFPA Afghanistan Representative. The report includes selected demographic, social and economic indicators monitoring the progress made on the internationally agreed upon goals during the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, Egypt â€“ September 1994). Population dynamics in Afghanistan are described by the following numbers: â€“ population growth 3.1% â€“ urban population 23% â€“ total fertility rate 6.0 â€“ life expectancy at birth for male and female is 49 â€“ population using an improved sanitation facility 37% â€“ maternal mortality 1400 per 100,000 live births â€“ births attended by skilled health personnel 14% â€“ contraceptive prevalence rate any method 23%, modern method 15% UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is an international development agency that promotes the right of every woman, man and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity. UNFPA supports countries in using population data for policies and programmes to reduce poverty and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV/AIDS, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect.

Afghanistan: quite off track of MDGs,The largest online news service for Afghanistan,Khaama Press,04-07-2015,The Khaama Press News Agency,"Author: Ghulam Rasool Folladwand 2015 is an important year and full of agendas for those who are dealing with development issues: in July world leaders are gathering in Addis Ababa to discuss new financing for development and constitute the implementation of post 2015 development agenda, more importantly in September the new Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are going to be discussed and agreed in New York. Addis gathering is to track progress made in the implementation of Monterrey and Doha Declarations, addressing the current international development cooperation landscape and reinvigorate the process of financing for development[i]. The eight MDGs were set in 2001 with ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015 but all goals does not seems to be reachable except poverty which is somehow mainly due to Chinaâ€™s fabulous growth. Itâ€™s not clear yet either will be more goals included or will it remain the same but, circumstances in the world has much worsened than before, considering the fact the past problems are still in its place, world is less peaceful and much insecure than before while climate change and its side effects is appearing stronger than ever. New York will host one of its important gathering this September. MDGs are eight in numbers starting from eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, to universal access to primary education, promote gender equality & women empowerment, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, environmental sustainability and global partnership for development followed by subsequent targets and indicators. Governance might emerge a new insertion in the New MGDs; in respect to the context of Afghanistan security and measures to improve the security situation has already been marked by United National Development Program as MDG9[ii]. After major withdrawal of International troops lead by United States, despite 350,000 Afghan armed forces, the country is experiencing deteriorate security situation mainly threaten by Taliban and newly arisen Islamic State branch in Afghanistan. Future is very unclear and nobody knows what new measures and how will it contribute to bring peace in the territory. A part from that, sustainability in financing those forces in a country with 35% poverty rate and hugely dependent to international aid is a matter of concern. Government has a large deficit and can only finance 60% of its operational budget, the rest 40 and the entire development budget is on the shoulder of donors while donors, mainly westerns are scrimmaging with the aftershocks of devastating 2008 financial crisis. Poverty Despite the fact that for the past decade Afghanistan was the core of international donors allocation, poverty still remained very high and a major challenge ahead. According to World Bank estimates, approximately 35% of population or over 10 million Afghans are not able to meet their basic needs. Considering the extreme poverty exist there, the country spends half of its budget to its military with rising questions on military contracts with corruption. Afghan president Ashraf Ghani who served as senior World Bank advisor, in a recent memo a part from welcoming Ramadan, he is seriously concerned for this poor country and its huge military spending. War and military spending will cause not to pay attention to poverty and exclusion which are the main enemy of Afghans. Looking to the rough figures on poverty it requires that measures should be doubled in order to half extreme poverty but thatâ€™s not the case, situation is getting worse than ever before, donors increasingly cutting funds, hundreds of projects are closed and people are losing their jobs. This has caused thousands of more people to drop under poverty line. There has always been lack of data in almost every sector in Afghanistan but in the job market each opening viewed by more than thousands of applicants looking for job. According to Afghan Journalist Shahhussain Murtazawi, for the recent 38 new openings in the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) over than 6,000 candidates have filled job application form. The economic growth has sharply and largely slowed down. World Bank recent reports states that growth declined from an average of 9 percent during 2003-2012 to 3.7 percent in 2013 and 2 percent in 2014 which is mostly the result of protracted political transition in 2014 and slow pace of reforms. The report furthered, â€œthe growth outlook for 2015 remains weak: unfavourable weather conditions for agriculture production and lagged effects from last year could continue to undermine economic recovery.â€� The so called â€œpolitical transitionâ€� has had devastating prices for Afghans; according to ex-authorities of Ministry of Finance; election and political transition caused $5 billion loses for the economy and $6 billion capital flown out in 2014. Thatâ€™s still going on and is a situation of extreme stress it will very soon change to crisis if there not enough attention paid by the players. Education In each conference one of the most flourished parade exercised every time by both international community and Afghan government is education. Over the past decade significant achievements have been made. According to statistics released by Ministry of Education more than 8 million children are enrolled at schools of which girlâ€™s enrolment rate which was almost zero in 2001 reached to 42%. The figures have been questioned by new Minister of Education in a parliament session and by US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) John F. Sopko in a letter to USAID Afghanistan stating that former authorities in the Ministry of Education provided false data to the government and donors claiming more schools in the country than what actually is the case in order to obtain more funds. But this is not the first time, United Nation Office on Drug and Crime in a joint research with Afghanistan High Office of Oversight and Anticorruption titled â€œCorruption in Afghanistanâ€� declared that the cost of corruption reached to $3.9 billion in 2012 of which most of them are paid in bribe in health and education sectors. School enrolment rate for girls reached 42% since 2001. Statistics are moving quite well, in Kabul the capital city hundred of private education centres are established. Jogging around in the streets you would probably end up in almost each street signboards tagged X and Y institute providing education services to pupils. But less attention has been paid to quality. Private education centres are less controlled, less organized, strict and standard roles about didactic materials does not exist, generally speaking it looks more an earning money business as Hamid Karzai ex-president pointed out â€œIn Britain, the United States, India and elsewhere, private education standards are very high. The same level of standards can also be achieved in Afghanistan but unfortunately right now some of these institutions are only there to earn money.â€� [iii] He furthered â€œDear brothers and elders, who have opened institutes for personal gain and business, please go and earn your money by other means, but donâ€™t dupe our children with bogus certificates.â€� As the president and the kind of authorities he had this is not supposed to be the way to act, he could set very strict rules targeting quality in the education sector; those who are fit could have stayed, and the rest had to be taken out. This does not need funds or advisors: it can be done within his team in few months but nobody did it. Afghans are hungry for education, last year over 246,000 pupils registered for kankor exams whom only 54% (117,000) have been accepted in higher education institutions mainly due to lack of capacity. For the rest and majority (56%) seems nobody cares about. this is fundamentally important and has to be paid attention to otherwise could be a driven force towards more insurgency in this fragile situation and might easily be recruited in this particular circumstances where ISIS is recruiting in the country. Despite significant progress access to education still remained very low; approximately 42% of 12 million school aged children do not have access to education. Literacy rate still remained lower comparing to other countries in the region (38.2%) where female are considered the lowest. Over five thousand schools have no usable building or retaining walls while 73% of teachers lack the minimum required qualification of grade 14 graduations which is a need of professional development. A lot has been done but still dozens of challenges exist. Global Partnership for Development Afghanistan with the strong support of international community in particular United States has managed to establish a unique partnership with donors in the last decade. The peculiarity of this partnership and its uniquety would not be easy to find example in the whole history of the country, or to exaggerate a bit â€œeven in the worldâ€�. Looking to the trends of leading donors from 2002 to 2014 Afghanistan remained a high priority in their foreign policy and development assistance. According to recent SIGAR quarterly report to US congress published in April, the United States had appropriated approximately $109.78 billion for relief and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan since fiscal year (FY) 2002, followed by Japan, Germany, Britain and multilateral institution as World Bank, European Commission and Asian Development Bank as major contributors. SIGAR come out with another calculation stating that this money is more than what US provided for Europe after World War II as Marshal Plan. It looks a bit puzzling but considering all other factors constant, the money in terms of its real value is more than what had been provided to the whole Western Europe. The contribution and generosity of donors and tax payers has to be well appreciated, off course, they did fabulous jobs and undertook many sacrifices that cost them money and lives. But the aid has been less effective in terms of Aid Effectiveness Principles agreed in Paris as Paris Declaration (2005). According to Oxfam Facts on Aid to Afghanistan 2008[iv], â€œan estimated 40% of aid goes back to donor countries in corporate profits and consultant salaries, profit margins on reconstruction contracts for international and Afghan contractor companies are often 20% and can be as high as 50%, most full time expatriate consultants working in private consulting companies cost $250,000â€“ $500,000 a year and, over half of aid is tied requiring the procurement of donor-country goods and services.â€� Now the scenario has changed a lot, in a full collaboration Afghan government and International Community following the two conferences in Kabul and London(The Kabul Process) has created 21 National Priority Programs (NPPs) in five clusters[v]: Security, Governance, Human Resource Development, Agriculture and Rural Development, Infrastructure Development and, Private Sector Development with a particular monitoring mechanism managed by government and International community through JCMB(Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board) chaired by United Nation Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). At this time where almost all procedures, better and transparent mechanisms are in place, unfortunately funds are diminished huge which made the situation tougher than it is. In the case of US for 2014, Lawmakers allocated $1.1 billion for assistance to Afghanistan, the 50 percent of the $2.1 billion Obama administration sought, which would have kept spending at the same level as last year. In the case of US assistance to Afghanistan a sudden 50% reduction is a shock!! It came mainly due to refusal of signing Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) by Ex-president Hamid Karzai that would keep US troops and funding in Afghanistan beyond 2014. The ups and down in the relationship with the United States and ex-president Karzai has cost the country a lot: international community were left in a situation of unknown and the funding which supposed to approved by their parliaments were left as draft papers, as a result most of the development projects stopped, thousands lost their jobs, billions of dollars out flowed to gulf countries and the country and people were left in a situation of stress and extremely concerned which further tracked off the country to achieve its targets in Millennium Development Goals.

Curious about HIV/AIDS? Just Ask Marlo,A new online chat platform is the latest innovation that tries to raise public awareness about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-22,The Jakarta Post,"A new online chat platform is the latest innovation that tries to raise public awareness about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The platform called Tanya Marlo (Ask Marlo) features a character named Marlo who constantly reminds and informs users about HIV/AIDS. â€œLetâ€™s take a HIV test!â€� Marlo says through the platform, which is integrated with the LINE application. Wearing a yellow shirt under a blue sweater, the bespectacled man encourages anyone, especially those who are sexually active, to take a HIV test at least once a year to maintain a healthy sex life. HIV is preventable, Marlo reminds users via the platform. The earlier the virus is detected, the earlier treatment can be administered, not only to improve the health of patients but also reduce or even eliminate the risk of transmitting it to their sexual partner. Therefore, taking a HIV test matters. It is estimated that 48 percent of the 640,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia are aware of their status, according to the Health Ministry. People who do not have HIV also need to understand HIV/AIDS to prevent them from discriminating against or stereotyping people with the condition. Being the subject of unwanted rumors is one of the reasons why many people are reluctant to take a HIV test. With many people in the country yet to fully understand HIV/AIDS, Marlo is ready to serve anyone who wants to seek information about it confidentially. He is aware that people with HIV/AIDS face stigma and discrimination in Indonesia, where talking about sex is deemed taboo. He therefore guarantees that any conversation with him is confidential. â€œDo you want to contact me through LINE or WhatsApp?â€� Marlo asks. The United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and developers Nimbly Technologies and Botika are behind Tanya Marlo. Together, they officially launched the platform last December. â€œTanya Marlo is a mobile chat platform that is friendly and for people who need information about HIV/AIDS. We present Tanya Marlo to answer all challenges faced by people with the condition in Indonesia. We utilize digital technology as a new way to interact with the young who might not be able to access information about HIV/AIDS,â€� UNAIDS Indonesia country director Krittayawan Boonto said. Tanya Marlo is the worldâ€™s first chat-box about HIV/AIDS. To make friends with Marlo, a user first has to install the LINE app on their mobile phone. Then, users need to add @TanyaMarlo to their friends list. After that, they will see four features on Tanya Marlo; Consultation, HIV Test, HIV Info and Quiz. If users click the Consultation feature, they can chat to trusted counselors through LINE or WhatsApp. If users choose the latter, they will have access to the WhatsApp number of a counselor to communicate with him or her confidentially. The counselor will be a friend. This is why users do not need to feel embarrassed about asking anything, including questions that people generally deem taboo. Users, for example, may ask whether it is fine to have unprotected sex if they and their partner are HIV-positive. The HIV Info features articles, infographics and videos about HIV/AIDS, such as basic information like the difference between HIV and AIDS to the history of it, preventive measures, and treatment and care. The Consultation and HIV Info features will convince users to have the courage to take a HIV test. The HIV Test feature, meanwhile, will inform users about the locations of clinics that provide HIV testing services, including their hours of operation and the procedures they have to undergo. In Indonesia, where people who are HIV-positive can access treatment for free, there are more than 5,000 testing sites and over 600 antiretroviral (ARV) treatment centers, according to UNAIDS Indonesia. However, only 15 percent of people who know of their HIV status undergo ARV treatment. â€œThe crucial element that is missing is the knowledge about HIV. Without the knowledge, people are unable to make life-saving decisions, such as getting tested and initiating ARV treatment to be healthy and productive,â€� said Krittayawan. The last feature of Tanya Marlo is the Quiz where users can test their understanding about HIV/AIDS. The Quiz features multiple-choice questions that debunk the most popular myths about HIV/AIDS, such as how the virus or illness is transferable through mosquito bites, sharing kitchen utensils and using the same toilet. HIV/AIDS activist Tesa Sampurno, who is openly HIV-positive, expressed appreciation for the launch of Tanya Marlo, expressing hope that more people would not be fooled by HIV/AIDS myths. He said living with HIV/AIDS was hard, while discrimination and stereotyping made it harder. Tesa vividly remembers the moment his family created distance with him after he was diagnosed with AIDS in August 2007. At that time, they believed that HIV could be easily spread through touch. â€œThey refused to shake my hand. They even wrote my name on the cups and plates I used,â€� he said. Hailing from Bandung, West Java, Tesa said he got HIV from needles that he did not realize were unsterile when he was a drug addict from 1995 to 2000. The 34-year-old has proven that living with HIV is not a death sentence. He is still healthy thanks to ARV medicine that he drinks every day. He looks as well as anyone else. In October last year, he took part in the Jakarta Marathon, running the 42-kilometer race to prove that HIV-positive people can be as healthy as those who live without the virus. â€œThe keys to keeping fit are exercising regularly, following a healthy lifestyle, avoiding stress and the most important thing is to be happy,â€� he said. UNAIDS is upbeat that Tanya Marlo will effectively educate people, especially the young, about HIV/AIDS. The Health Ministryâ€™s data shows that around 52 percent of people who are newly diagnosed with HIV are young people aged between 15 and 24. Indonesia itself is one of LINEâ€™s top three overseas markets with around 90 million registered users. Around 80 percent of them are millennials. The government has committed to end the spread of AIDS by 2030. By then, it is expected that 90 percent of people who live with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia will be aware of their status and 90 percent of these people will undergo ARV treatment.

Discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS evidence of â€˜systemic failureâ€™: Advocates,Regional health agencies only handle HIV/AIDS from a health perspective.,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-02-19,The Jakarta Post,"The Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC) has urged the government to establish a special working unit to increase public awareness about HIV/AIDS following recent cases in Surakarta, Central Java, and Samosir Regency, North Sumatra, of students living with HIV/AIDS being prevented from attending school following complaints from parents of other students. Earlier this month in Surakarta, 14 students of Purwotomo 74 public elementary school, who were identified as HIV positive, were transferred to special schools after protests from parents of other students. Parents and guardians of other students allegedly told the schoolâ€™s management they would transfer their children to another school if the schoolâ€™s management allowed the students with HIV to continue attending. The schools principal said he was of the view that every child had the right to education. However, he said he did not have a choice and was forced to transfer the students, who were studying in the first through to fourth grades. Read also: We had no choice: Surakarta school expels students with HIV/AIDS A similar case also occurred in Samosir regency in October last year, in which three HIV-positive orphans were not allowed to attend Welipa kindergarten and Nainggolan public elementary school by locals who feared they might get infected with the virus. They were also threatened with exile from the regency. However, after mediation involving school management, the local community and the regency administration, it was suggested that the children be homeschooled. Read also: Residents tell HIV-positive orphans to leave Samosir â€œThis is very tragic and a systemic failure,â€� Aditya Wardhana, the executive director of the Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC), told The Jakarta Post on Monday. He said the government had caused a â€œsetbackâ€� by terminating the National AIDS Commission (KPAN), which had representative offices across the country and had operated for more than 10 years, in 2017 following 2016â€™s Presidential Regulation on the commission for AIDS prevention signed by President Joko â€œJokowiâ€� Widodo. AIDS control and prevention has been handled by regional health agencies ever since. â€œThe agencies only handle HIV/AIDS from a health perspective. However, it must involve other aspects, such as social, economic and even the psychological aspects of each person infected with the virus,â€� Aditya said. He also said it was difficult for health agencies to intervene in school decisions because that required coordination with local education agencies. â€œThe President should establish a special cross-ministerial working unit only for this issue in a bid to prevent this form of discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS in schools,â€� he said. Meanwhile, Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) commissioner Jasra Putra urged the mayors or regents involved to find a solution to discrimination against children with HIV/AIDS because the primary and elementary school were under their supervision. â€œThey need to instill the school stakeholders, including teachers and heads of the schools, with the same perception regarding this issue,â€� he told the Post. Jasra said further that parents must also be made aware of the issue so they would not interfere or provoke school managements to expel students infected with the virus. â€œThis concern will keep coming up if local governments do not help them to understand,"" he said. According to Jasra, each of the studentâ€™s health should be confirmed. â€œBy doing this, they can prevent the HIV positive children from being isolated from their friends,â€� he added. Director of elementary school development at the Education and Culture Ministry, Khamim, stressed that each child must get an education. Both the health and education agencies in municipalities across the country have conducted campaigns about HIV/AIDS prevention, however, parents remain worried about their children being infected by their friends with HIV/AIDS. â€œHealth agencies informed the parents that the children would not transmit their viruses to their children, but the parents wanted the infected children out of the school,â€� he told the Post.

HIV patient's remission spurs hope for curing AIDS-causing virus,"A stem-cell treatment put a London patientâ€™s HIV into remission, marking the second such reported case and reinvigorating efforts to cure the AIDS-causing infection that afflicts some 37 million people globally.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-03-05,The Jakarta Post,"A stem-cell treatment put a London patientâ€™s HIV into remission, marking the second such reported case and reinvigorating efforts to cure the AIDS-causing infection that afflicts some 37 million people globally. The patient has been in remission for 18 months. Thatâ€™s too soon to label the treatment -- which used hematopoietic stem cells from a donor with two copies of an HIV-resistance gene -- as a cure, researchers said Tuesday in a study in the journal Nature. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to other blood cells. An embargo on the paper was lifted due to early reporting of the finding. The New York Times said Monday that the latest surprise success confirms that a cure for HIV infection is possible. Leukemia patient Timothy Brown, who became known as the â€œBerlin patient,â€� was treated aggressively 10 years ago in an HIV-curing approach that hasnâ€™t been successfully repeated until Ravindra Gupta at Englandâ€™s University of Cambridge and colleagues showed the effectiveness of a less aggressive form of treatment. The latest case was in an HIV-positive patient with advanced Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma who received a transplant of hematopoietic stem cells from a donor with two copies of the so-called CCR5 gene mutation -- the same one allegedly edited by He Jiankui that led to the birth of the worldâ€™s first gene-edited babies last year. â€œComing 10 years after the successful report of the â€˜Berlin Patient,â€™ this new case confirms that bone marrow transplantation from a CCR5-negative donor can eliminate residual virus and stop any traces of virus from rebounding,â€� said Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne, in a statement. Scalable approach The London patient has no detectable HIV virus, Gupta and colleagues said. â€œWe speculate that CCR5 gene therapy strategies using stem cells could conceivably be a scalable approach to remission,â€� they said. Scientists at IciStem, a consortium of European scientists researching use of stem cell transplants to treat the illness, say the London patient received a bone-marrow transplant in 2016 and was given immunosuppresive drugs. He stopped taking his HIV medication in September of 2017. There are important limitations to applying the findings of the London patient to a HIV cure, said Anthony Kelleher, director of the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Still, the London case shows that â€œHIV cures are possible,â€� he said. Read also: Curious about HIV/AIDS? Just Ask Marlo Gene editing â€œCommon to both approaches is the presence of a modified gene in our immune system -- CCR5 -- that is necessary for HIV infection,â€� Kelleher said in a statement. â€œThis tells us that the feasibility, and importantly, the availability of delivering this approach could possibly be achieved by the rapidly accelerating field of gene editing and related gene therapies.â€� Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV and about 35 million people have died because of complications from the viral illness. Worldwide, an estimated 36.9 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. Progress against AIDS over the past 15 years has inspired a commitment by United Nations member states to end the epidemic by 2030. The number of people newly infected with HIV fell to 1.8 million worldwide in 2017, from more than 3 million a year through most of the 1990s. Researchers are developing better antiretroviral treatments, prevention methods, and vaccines to halt infections while continuing to pursue a cure for those already infected. That goal is â€œlikely to be many years away,â€� said Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and an honorary consultant physician at Cardiff University. â€œUntil then, the emphasis needs to remain on prompt diagnosis of HIV and initiation of life-long combination antiretroviral therapy,â€� Freedman said in a statement.",{},"['virus', 'stem', 'aidscausing', 'hiv', 'patients', 'million', 'gene', 'spurs', 'remission', 'curing', 'london', 'infection', 'cells', 'case', 'hope', 'patient', 'cure']","Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to other blood cells.

An American convicted of numerous crimes is believed to have leaked the information after obtaining it from his partner, a Singaporean doctor with access to the HIV registry, the ministry of health said. It comes after the health records of 1.5 million Singaporeans, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, were stolen in a suspected state-sponsored attack in June and July, the countrys biggest ever data breach.

'Our lives are at stake': People with HIV/AIDS face drugs scarcity,"HIV/AIDS treatment currently has the second biggest budget allocation from the ministry, after the allocation for vaccine procurement.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-12,The Jakarta Post,"Indonesia Positive Women Association (IPPI) national coordinator Baby Rivolaâ€™s cell phone has been buzzing day and night over the past two weeks. Women, mostly mothers with human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) from across the archipelago, have been telling her about their concerns after they heard that the nation was running out of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) antiretroviral drug (ARV), a tablet containing tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz (TLE). â€œMost of them have used FDC for years. But they said hospitals in their respective regions had ran out of FDC months ago and they had to start using single doses of those three drugs instead of the FDC,â€� Baby said on Thursday. The women were worried about their condition without the drug. They were also wondering about their treatment. â€œIt is important for the mothers to take the pill regularly not only to save their lives but also to prevent the virus from infecting others,â€� she said. Taking TLE regularly is deemed the most effective treatment to reduce the HIV viral load in the body to an undetectable level. However, the tender to procure the drug recently fell through after the government and state-owned pharmaceutical companies PT Kimia Farma and PT Indofarma, the authorized producers of the drug in the country, disagreed on the pricing. TLE is the most used drug among people with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia. Around 48,000 people, or 42 percent of people with HIV/AIDS, rely on TLE. Aditya Wardhana, the executive director of the Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC), said even though the government had made an emergency procurement financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, the current supply of TLE would only last until April at most. â€œHonestly, we can die in less than a year if we do not take the drug. Our lives are at stake. What should I say to my children, because I really donâ€™t know whether Iâ€™ll still be around them by the end of the year,â€� she said. The nation has pledged to reach the 90-90-90 target in 2027; 90 percent of people with HIV/AIDS will be aware of their HIV status, 90 percent of them get ARV treatment, and 90 percent of them have their viral load suppressed. The budget allocated for ARV treatment has also increased every year. In 2017, the Health Ministry allocated Rp 1.19 billion (US$84,673) to fund ARV treatment for 112,054 people with HIV. The allocation increased from Rp 243 million in 2015, and is predicted to reach 1.8 trillion by 2020. HIV/AIDS treatment currently has the second biggest budget allocation from the ministry, after the allocation for vaccine procurement. While lauding the governmentâ€™s commitment to HIV/AIDS treatment, Aditya of the IAC said the nation â€œshould not spend that much money on ARV treatmentâ€� because based on the coalitionâ€™s survey, the drugs could be purchased almost 400 hundred percent cheaper outside Indonesia. â€œCompared to other countries in the world, ARV in Indonesia is the most expensive one,â€� Aditya said, adding that he hoped Kimia Farma and Indofarma, as state-owned pharmaceutical companies, were not only seeking profit. â€œEven for a reasonable profit they could sell it for Rp 175,000 but instead they sell it at around Rp 400,000 per bottle. It is too expensive. One bottle only lasts for a month, so imagine how much money must be spent for that in a year for every person,â€� he said. The coalition also encouraged President Joko â€œJokowiâ€� Widodo to immediately call on related ministries to help with the negotiation. When asked about the IACâ€™s view on the price of ARV, Kimia Farma president director, Honesti Basyir, said he â€œnever heard about that statement and do not know how did the IAC compared the price with other countriesâ€�. â€œWe always make our best effort to support the government program, as long as we are able to do it [..] since 2005, Kimia Farma has provided ARV for people living with HIV, even though the population of people taking ARV remains very small,â€� he said. The ministryâ€™s director general for pharmacy and medical equipment, Engko Sosialine Magdalene, admitted that the tender had failed and explained that the price of locally produced ARV was higher in Indonesia as a result of the additional costs to produce the medicine. â€œWe have to consider many costs, such as the import tax as well as cargo and transportation fees. When they [IAC] calculate the price, they should add these costs into their calculation as well,â€� Engko told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Engko also said the country had enough ARV supplies for the next 10 months. According to Engko, people with HIV/AIDS can still take fixed-dose drugs until this April and continue their medication with a single-tablet regimen as an alternative. Data from the Health Ministry show that over 2 million Indonesians have taken an HIV test. Of those, 314,143 were declared positive, with 212,240 having started ARV therapy since 2018.

Stigma still thwarts HIV prevention,"Indonesia is one out of three countries that has seen an increase in HIV/AIDS along with the Philippines and Russia.

While the world trend is decreasing, Indonesia failed to reduce the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus and mitigate the harm. Thus far, it has only managed to diagnose 47 percent of people living with HIV from an estimated 640,443 HIV positive cases; only 32 percent of people living with HIV received antiretroviral drugs from 301,959 diagnosed HIV positive cases and less than 1 percent of people living with HIV has been successfully treated and exhibited undetectable HIV in their blood. This gap is immense compared with 90 percent of the target for each indicator as urged by the United Nations Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS), which aims to eliminate HIV as a public health threat by 2030. Stigma and discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS remain strong in Indonesia. Such stigma elicits an irrational or fear-driven negative attitude, behavior, and judgment toward people living with HIV and those perceived to be living with HIV. Recently, students living with HIV in Samosir, North Sumatra, and Tulungagung, East Java, feared being expelled from their respective schools. Such stigma and discrimination or fear of being stigmatized and discriminated against cause anxiety, depression, guilt, isolation, low self-esteem, disruption of family dynamics, physical and emotional violence, intensification of grief, and loss of social support. Self-stigma bundled with discrimination prevent people from accessing education and information on preventive behavior, refute risk, refuse to test, not seeking health assistance, delay treatment, and not adhering to therapy. This health-avoiding behavior results in the increasing HIV rate of transmission, declining of patientâ€™s quality of life and a higher risk of AIDS-related death. This yearâ€™s World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, which was its 30th anniversary, addressed this issue with the theme â€œKnow your Statusâ€�. Those afraid of being stigmatized may avoid even testing, let alone seek treatment. According to the Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) 2018, 65.2 percent of Indonesians have a poor understanding of HIV/AIDS. Misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS has contributed to public fear, stigma, and discrimination. People must understand that HIV/AIDS can be prevented and managed so that people living with HIV can live as healthily as normal people. Health workers have the credibility to inform society and convince them to destigmatize HIV/AIDS. Thus, health facilities are pivotal to help put an end to stigmatization and discrimination. They must be strengthened to empower people living with HIV. There are three important messages for health workers to circulate in society. First, with the advent of antiretroviral therapy, HIV is now a manageable disease. We can prevent HIV from becoming AIDS, a very dangerous late stage of the disease. AIDS-related deaths dropped dramatically from 11 per 100 persons per year in 1992 to 0.144 in 2006. HIV infection is no longer a death sentence as newer and safer drugs are available as the government provides free drugs to people living with HIV. Second, HIV transmission can be prevented by abstinence from sex with a high-risk partner, using condoms, and avoiding communal syringes. Transmission from mother to child can also be prevented during pregnancy as long as the mother takes her daily pills. Moreover, not all people who are HIV positive transmit the virus. Recent research shows that people living with HIV who take medication regularly and have undetected HIV in the blood (the virus is suppressed by the drug) do not transmit the disease. Third, this disease is not dependent on morality. Most patients (28 percent) are housewife and her vertically infected children, medical staff accidentally punctured by needles from patient and blood transfusion recipients. Our stigma-producing society makes such people suffer more. UNAIDS has identified that reducing stigma and discrimination is a critical part of the national HIV/AIDS program. Countries with low stigma and discrimination towards HIV/AIDS program have been more successful in their prevention and treatment program. As HIV infection rates are rising, Indonesia must destigmatize HIV/AIDS to reduce its transmission and HIV-related mortality in Indonesia. *** The writer is a physician who graduated from the University of Indonesia (UI) with experience in West Papua and Jakarta.

US performs first kidney transplant from living donor with HIV,"The kidney of a 35-year-old HIV-positive woman has been transplanted into another patient with the virus that causes AIDS, US surgeons announced Thursday, in a major medical breakthrough.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-03-29,The Jakarta Post,"The kidney of a 35-year-old HIV-positive woman has been transplanted into another patient with the virus that causes AIDS, US surgeons announced Thursday, in a major medical breakthrough. The surgeons at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore performed the operation on Monday, calling it the first in the world of its kind. ""Im feeling good,"" said the donor, Nina Martinez, at a news conference on Thursday following the surgery. The recipient, who has not been identified, is doing ""beautifully,"" said Christine Durand, associate professor of medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins. They are ""incredibly grateful for this gift and now we just monitor for the long term outcomes,"" Durand said. Martinez initially wanted to donate the kidney to a friend, but after that friend died, she pursued her wish to be an organ donor, Johns Hopkins said. The Atlanta resident, who was inspired to donate her kidney by an episode of ""Greys Anatomy,"" said she was excited to be part of a medical first. ""I knew that I was the one that they had been waiting for,"" she said. ""For anyone considering embarking on this journey, its doable. ""Ive just showed you how and Im very excited to see who the first follow-on might be."" Before this transplant operation, doctors had believed it too risky to leave an HIV-positive patient with only one kidney. The decision to move forward with the transplant highlights the confidence scientists have in current anti-retroviral medication, which allows those with HIV to lead normal, productive lives. Thousands of people die each year in the United States awaiting organ transplants. Doors are now open Dorry Segev, an associate professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said about 500-600 HIV-positive patients could donate organs each year, benefiting about 1,000 people with the virus. Until now, HIV-positive patients could receive organs from dead HIV-positive patients but not from anyone living with the virus. They could also previously receive an organ from someone who was not HIV-positive.

Johns Hopkins University Hospital received authorization in 2016 to move ahead with the first transplant from a living donor with HIV. Surgeons had been waiting to find compatible patients. Martinez and the recipient of her kidney will have to keep taking their anti-retroviral medication. ""The doors are now open for people living with HIV to become kidney donors,"" said Segev. ""Now anybody can do this anywhere in the world, provided that they screen the patients accordingly. ""For us, this is not only a celebration of transplantation but a celebration of the progress of HIV care,"" he said. ""And the fact that 30 years ago, a disease that was basically a death sentence has been so transformed, that today somebody with HIV can save somebody elses life.""

Debunking myths about HIV/AIDS,"Based on a study in 2016 conducted by UNAIDS, an organization under the United Nations dedicated to protecting those suffering from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), 36.7 million global citizens have been infected by the said condition.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"Based on a study in 2016 conducted by UNAIDS, an organization under the United Nations dedicated to protecting those suffering from AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), 36.7 million global citizens have been infected by the said condition. It has been more than 30 years since HIV/AIDS was first detected, and through the years, there has been much improvement in the detection and treatment of the disease. Although most of the urban world claims to know the basics of what HIV and AIDS are â€“ their causes, symptoms and prevention steps â€“ there are untrue allegations that have been spread on the condition, leading to a series of myths that circulate within the community. In conjunction with World AIDS Day today, itâ€™s timely that we once again debunk some of the more common myths about the disease. 1. HIV equals AIDS One prevalent myth is that anyone infected by HIV automatically has AIDS. This has grown to be the most common assumption since society finds it difficult to tell the two things apart. It is actually a fairly simple concept â€“ AIDS is the result of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) damaging oneâ€™s immune system to the extent of leaving them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and illnesses such as fevers, mouth sores, lung diseases, yeast infection, and some cancers. In short, HIV is the contagion, and AIDS is the condition that can develop if it is left untreated. Those with HIV donâ€™t necessarily have AIDS, but those with AIDS definitely have HIV. 2. Those with HIV look very sick When HIV-positive people are mentioned, society pictures sickly-looking ill patients, a widely believed misconception. This is not the case, as most of the time, those who are HIV-positive look just as well as anyone else. Even early symptoms of AIDS resemble typical illnesses, including sore throats, increased body temperature and muscle aches. Read also: People who live with AIDS in Jakarta increasing: KPAP 3. Touching spreads HIV Many think that AIDS can easily be spread through contact with someone who has the condition, for example, through drinking from the same bottle, sharing utensils, and using the same toilet. Some even think that touching a diagnosed person will spread the virus to them, making the act of merely shaking their hand seem like a daunting task. This false rumor about the virus has instilled a fear of interaction with HIV-positive people within society. Truth be told, HIV cannot be spread through touch, saliva or sweat, and thinking so belittles those with the condition. In most cases, the virus is sexually transmitted, spread through bodily fluids like semen, vaginal discharge and blood. 4. HIV means an early death Another myth we often mistake as truth is that being infected with HIV will ultimately lead to an early death for those diagnosed when they are young. Yes, having HIV is a risk to your health, but no, it is not a death sentence. Compared to three decades ago when it was just discovered, we have the advantage of top-notch medical technology and the best medicines readily available to prevent the deterioration of a HIV-positive personâ€™s health, and as long as they maintain optimal living habits, an average 70 years of life expectancy can be seized. 5. Only younger people get HIV The belief that those of older age do not get infected by HIV is false. Believe it or not, UNAIDS suggests that approximately 4.2 million elderly adults above the age of 50 worldwide suffer from the problem. The older age group is often overlooked when it comes to HIV prevention programs. Unfortunately, many of them lack knowledge and understanding on the subject and almost half are unaware that they have been infected sometimes. Read also: A closer look at life as HIV-positive 6. HIV only affects homosexuals In the early 1980s, it was observed that HIV mainly affected men who engage in homosexual sex. This brings up one of the more contentious misconceptions circling global society regarding the condition, which is that those who only perform heterosexual intercourse are relatively safe from getting AIDS. In our world today, almost a quarter of those living with AIDS are heterosexual men and women, most likely those who precariously disregarded sex protection and HIV prevention due to the â€œonly homosexuals get AIDSâ€� stigma. 7. HIV-diagnosed women cannot undergo healthy pregnancies Having unprotected intercourse can result in the pregnancy of a HIV-positive woman, and more often than not, said pregnancies do pass without any serious complications caused by the virus. This defeats the myth that HIV-diagnosed women cannot undergo healthy pregnancies. Antiretrovial therapy can be taken during the pregnancy to ensure a healthy baby. 8. A pregnant woman with HIV will give birth to a HIV-positive baby Another misconception is that those born from a HIV-positive parent (or parents) will automatically contract the virus. The fact is, as long as the mother practices the dos and donâ€™ts of pregnancy and sticks to the prescribed medications, the chances of birthing a HIV-positive baby are minimal. 9. It is all right to have unprotected sex if both partners are tested HIV-positive Another myth to be debunked is that it is seemingly all right to have unprotected sex if both partners are tested HIV-positive. Although there is no risk of the other person contracting the viral load, it will result in higher chances of catching other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) like hepatitis B and syphilis, as HIV destroys CD4 cells meant to keep said diseases at bay. 10. You wonâ€™t get HIV if you donâ€™t have sex Many people assume that those who do not engage in any sexual acts at all are safe from ever getting infected by HIV/AIDS. This is not true, as many people get infected through substance abuse, or more specifically, through sharing needles with HIV-positives when injecting intoxicants in themselves. Similarly, unsterilized needles at tattoo parlors can cause one to catch the infection. Even though most myths that surround the HIV-positive community prove to be false, there are certain beliefs that are very much true, primarily the conception that the worldâ€™s minor ethnicities, mostly those residing in Sub-Saharan Africa, carry the most severe burden of AIDS in the world. Even in the US, the African-American community remains the most heavily impacted by AIDS. This happens because of socioeconomic issues, such as limited access to health facilities and education. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is not an easy one to combat, as there is no known, ultimate cure for it yet. But societyâ€™s presumptions on the matter also contribute in slowing down the progress of AIDS prevention in our world today. Doing research of what is true and untrue on this matter is crucial to hopefully decrease the number of victims of HIV/AIDS, as ignorance will no doubt lead to many more misconceptions about the condition.",{},"['infected', 'spread', 'myth', 'hivaids', 'virus', 'condition', 'hiv', 'prevention', 'myths', 'hivpositive', 'world', 'debunking', 'aids']","In conjunction with World AIDS Day today, itâ€™s timely that we once again debunk some of the more common myths about the disease.

Keeping Indonesian children HIV-free. Can we?,What Indonesians should learn is that preventive action is far more important than a merely curative one.,['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-05,The Jakarta Post,"The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Indonesia continues to rise. Since the United Nations millennium development goals were launched in 2000, the world has made tremendous gains in reducing new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and helping HIV/AIDS patients to live longer and healthier lives. With the 2016 UN Sustainable Development Goals, the UN aimed to end the global HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. This includes zero infections, zero deaths and zero discrimination. The Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) urges HIV/AIDS to be addressed seriously because of its huge impact on increasing mortality, emerging socioeconomic problems and declining global productivity. Indonesiaâ€™s Health Ministry records show that the number of HIV/AIDS cases in children has been increasing significantly since 2010. HIV-infected children may not have AIDS, so those who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) early can grow and develop well. Children are largely infected with HIV through mothers during pregnancy (5 to 10 percent), birth (10 to 20 percent) and breastfeeding (5 to 20 percent). Meanwhile less than 10 percent of children are infected through contaminated needles, blood transfusions, or sexual violence from HIV-infected adults. To end this HIV infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has implemented strategies focusing on primary prevention of HIV in women of childbearing age, prevention of unintended pregnancies in women living with HIV, prevention of HIV transmission from an HIV-infected woman to her infant and provision of appropriate treatment and support to women and children living with HIV. What Indonesians should learn is that preventive action is far more important than a merely curative one. Our neighbor Thailand was the first Asian country recognized by WHO for its target for eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission. The key is the high rate of antenatal care (ANC) provision. Voluntary HIV testing with same-day results is offered during the first clinic visit, followed by re-testing later in pregnancy for HIV-negative women. For HIV-infected pregnant women, ART is provided as soon as possible. Such treatment is available at a very low cost, thanks to Thai legislative changes that have allowed the non-commercial production of generic ART. Counseling services at antenatal clinics also promote dual methods of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy in women with HIV. These are the fruits of the early and concerted efforts of all sectors of Thai society â€” something Indonesia must emulate. In fact, the same approach had been applied by the Indonesian government regarding voluntary HIV testing for pregnant women. The governmentâ€™s recommendation for pregnant women to undergo voluntary HIV testing is regulated in a 2013 Health Ministry circular on prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Unlike Thailand, however, this voluntary HIV testing in Indonesia still faces many obstacles. The first and foremost obstacle is the difficult access to antenatal services for most pregnant women in Indonesia. Only 80 percent of pregnant women go to ANC providers, leaving millions of expectant mothers unmonitored. This is related to the lack of knowledge about the importance of ANC, as well as unequal access to healthcare providers, a chronic unresolved problem. So how can all the pregnant women be tested, if they do not even undergo ANC? The government should promote the importance of ANC and ensure all pregnant women have access to ANC. The ANC should be included within the Puskesmas Keliling (mobile community health center) program, to reach as many pregnant women as possible. Second and worse, medical personnel are generally still hesitant to offer HIV testing to pregnant women, assuming they will refuse. Even if they are willing to, their husbands are often reluctant to allow them. There is also concern regarding the protection of womenâ€™s privacy and their risk of becoming stigmatized for having undergone HIV testing. Apparently, the strategies required by each country vary depending on local conditions. In Indonesia, HIV testing being voluntary instead of mandatory makes many think it unnecessary. Thus, the government should make HIV testing for pregnant women mandatory. This policy would not be a panacea for the continuing pandemic of perinatally transmitted HIV, given the lack of access to ANC. However, whenever feasible, governments and other healthcare providers should consider HIV testing to be mandatory for all pregnant women. In addition, HIV-infected mothers should obtain enough information about the pluses and minuses of formula and breast milk consumption. Breast milk is a vector for HIV after birth. According to WHO, HIV-infected mothers who choose to feed the baby with formula milk should meet the criteria of it being acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe. If families cannot get formula milk with the above criteria, mothers may still breastfeed their babies as long as they employ proper breastfeeding techniques and continue to take ART. This education should be done by healthcare providers, especially those in community health centers and Posyandu (integrated health service posts). For a long time, efforts to make all children HIV-free have run into many obstacles. We have had numerous lessons in the importance of working together to safeguard children. Since children are the countryâ€™s future, how the country responds to the problems they face indicates how highly the country values its future. _________________________ The writer is a physician at Permata Depok Hospital, West Java, and a Master of public health in sociomedical sciences candidate at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York.",{},"['voluntary', 'hivaids', 'children', 'hiv', 'anc', 'indonesian', 'keeping', 'hivfree', 'women', 'pregnant', 'health', 'testing', 'hivinfected']","HIV-infected children may not have AIDS, so those who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) early can grow and develop well.

A healthy pregnancy is possible for people with HIV,"How can women with HIV have a healthy pregnancy? Here are some things that I am doing to make sure I have a healthy, HIV-free kid.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-10-17,The Jakarta Post,"When I was first diagnosed as HIV positive, I never thought that I would have lived this long. I was infected through my late husband, who passed away seven years ago. I have never used drugs or had free sex, but my husband was a user, injecting heroin under his skin. In 2009, we were both diagnosed with HIV and my husband passed away not long after that due to late treatment. At first I was pessimistic, thinking it would be impossible for me to marry again. I was not even sure that I would survive and continue living. Things changed when I met a support group. My motivation and will to live slowly recovered. I joined a national network of women with HIV, Indonesian Positive Women Network (IPPI). From the group, I learned about sexual health education, reproduction, gender, human rights and how women with HIV like me have the same rights as any other Indonesian woman, including the rights to have a healthy spouse and children. In 2012 I met a man from outside the HIV/AIDS community. Two years later, we got married and decided to move from Jakarta to Bandung. Since the beginning of our relationship, we have constantly strived to deepen our understanding of HIV and pregnancy preparation. All in order to prevent HIV transmission to my HIV-negative partner and our future kid. Our dream has come true; I am pregnant in 2016. How can women with HIV have a healthy pregnancy? Here are some things that I am doing to make sure I have a healthy, HIV-free kid. Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy Iâ€™ve been in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for seven years. ART consists of drugs that function to suppress the growth of HIV in the blood, preventing the virus from attacking the immune system. This drug must be taken at an exact time every day. Aside from for health recovery, ARV is key for people with HIV who are planning on becoming pregnant. ARV is available at certain hospitals and community health centers (Puskesmas) designated by the government for the HIV/AIDS program and for free due to a government subsidy. You must consult your doctor before starting to take ART. (Read also: More HIV centers set up as cases rise) Condoms and its role Condoms are highly important for me and my husbandâ€™s sexual life. My husband is HIV free, and we are committed to keeping it that way. To prevent transmission from sexual contact, condoms must be used every time. Only during fertile days are we allowed by doctors to have unprotected sex in order to get pregnant. Routine lab checks During pregnancy planning, a complete blood check must be done every three months. I also have to do a routine immunity count ( CD4 ) check every six months. Lastly, there is also an HIV RNA or viral load HIV check to count the amount of virus in my blood. If your blood check is good, the doctor will give you permission to start pregnancy planning. No less important is the annual HIV check for my husband. In our second year of marriage, he is still healthy and HIV-free. After a series of blood checks, I was declared fit and ready to have children. Calculation of fertile days To minimize transmission risk, we only have unprotected sex during fertile days. Even though my immunity is good and the virus in my blood is undetected, there is still a possibility of transmission. I really had to learn how to calculate fertile days in order to get pregnant, and it worked! Last month there were finally two stripes on my pregnancy test. Pregnancy check: To which doctor? After getting pregnant, we have to decide the next step. We must consult a doctor, either a HIV doctor or gynecologist. In every hospital appointed by the government, there is a special work unit specializing in HIV. Among all doctors, there must be one gynecologists highly educated in HIV issues. Delivery method and breastfeeding Mothers with HIV can choose the delivery method and food choice for their newborns. This means that we too can have a normal birth and breastfeed. Of course, with certain precautions. There are medical conditions that we have to consider for mothers with HIV who are planning to have a normal birth, including their CD4 count and viral load, and the condition of the baby. The same goes with breastfeeding. If the mother is not medically fit, the doctor will advise a caesarian birth and infant milk formula. (Read also: Huge challenges remain to end AIDS by 2030) Mother-to-child transmission prevention A newborn must be given prophylaxis, an ARV drug to prevent HIV transmission for babies. Prophylaxis usage depends on the choice of food we plan to give to the baby. Since I plan to breastfeed, my baby will be given prophylaxis during breastfeeding. Mothers with HIV are advised not to breastfeed for more than three to six months. Once the baby starts teething, there are risks of transmission from nipple wounds. If the mother opts for infant formula, the doctor will only give prophylaxis for six weeks. HIV check for your baby This is one step that I am waiting for. The check will be done in three stages.

Elton John: We must break HIV/AIDS stigma,"Too many people are still contracting HIV and dying of AIDS-related illnesses due to stigma and a lack of access to information and testing, Elton John said on Monday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-12-04,The Jakarta Post,"Too many people are still contracting HIV and dying of AIDS-related illnesses due to stigma and a lack of access to information and testing, Elton John said on Monday.

""Everyone should understand the risks of HIV, and everyone who needs it should have the chance of dignified help and support,"" John wrote in the letter, co-signed by The Independents owner Evgeny Lebedev. ""That can only happen if we know our status."" About a quarter of the 37 million HIV-positive people worldwide do not know they have the virus. Last year 1.8 million people were infected with HIV.

Nearly four in 10 US HIV infections from people unaware of infection,"Almost 40 percent of new HIV cases in the US occur because people do not know they are infected, while a similar proportion know but are not in treatment, according to a study released Monday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-03-19,The Jakarta Post,"Almost 40 percent of new HIV cases in the US occur because people do not know they are infected, while a similar proportion know but are not in treatment, according to a study released Monday. The report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is based on 2016 data and aims to bolster a strategy outlined by President Donald Trump to end the epidemic within 10 years. The strategy has two main strands: far more widespread screening, and enabling the infected better access to treatment from the moment they test positive. The study found that 38 percent of infections came from HIV-positive people who were unaware of their status, and 43 percent from people who knew they were infected but took no anti-retroviral drugs. The remaining infections came from people who were receiving HIV treatment but were not yet ""virally suppressed."" The CDC blamed financial, social and other reasons for people not using medication, which these days typically comes in the form of a daily pill with minimal side effects. The study said that the infection rate from the half million people in the United States who take medication and are virally suppressed -- meaning they cannot pass on the disease to others -- was zero. Screening The most at-risk group remains homosexual men, with almost three-quarters of new infections coming from men having sex with men, the report said. Five percent of infections came from intravenous drug abuse among homosexual men, while 10 percent came from injecting drugs among the rest of the population. Twelve percent of infections were among heterosexuals. Overall, the highest rate of transmission was among 13 to 24-year-olds. Read also: Stigma still thwarts HIV prevention The Trump administration has said it will invest $291 million in the next financial year to fight HIV/AIDS, which has plateaued since 2013 to around 39,000 annual transmissions. The goal is to reduce that number by 75 percent within five years and by 90 percent in 10 years. Questioned about the relatively small amount of money earmarked for the multi-billion dollar task of treating HIV carriers, CDC head Robert Redfield said he was ""confident that the resources that are required to accomplish this mission are in the long term plan."" The CDC, based in Atlanta, Georgia, wants doctors to make HIV screening a routine procedure. ""Everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime,"" said Eugene McCray, the head of the CDCs Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. ""Those at higher risk should get tested at least annually,"" he said. ""The key to controlling is helping those with HIV to control the virus,"" said the CDCs Jonathan Mermin, who focuses on preventing the spread of the HIV as well as other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and hepatitis.

Treatment prevents sexual HIV transmission among gay men: Study,"HIV-suppressing medication can make the AIDS virus ""untransmittable"" even among couples who have sex without using condoms, new research showed Friday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-05-03,The Jakarta Post,"HIV-suppressing medication can make the AIDS virus ""untransmittable"" even among couples who have sex without using condoms, new research showed Friday. The Europe-wide study monitored nearly 1,000 gay male couples over a period of eight years, where one partner was HIV-positive and receiving antiretroviral (ART) treatment, while the other was HIV negative. Doctors did not find a single case of in-couple HIV transmission within that time, raising hopes that widespread ART programs could eventually end new infections. ""Our findings provide conclusive evidence for gay men that the risk of HIV transmission with suppressive ART is zero,"" said Alison Rodger, from University College London, who co-lead the research published in The Lancet. ""They support the message... that an undetectable viral load makes HIV untransmittable. This powerful message can help end the HIV pandemic by preventing HIV transmission, and tackling the stigma and discrimination that many people with HIV face."" Researchers estimate that ART prevented around 470 HIV transmissions within couples during the study period. HIV and the fatal illnesses it provokes remain one of the worlds largest health crises despite much progress in recent years.

The authors of the study noted several limitations, including that the average age of the HIV-negative men was 38. Most HIV transmissions occur in people aged under 25. Individuals currently on ART must take medication almost every day for the rest of their lives, and treatment is often disrupted for a variety of reasons. But the fact that couples can have unprotected sex for years without passing on the virus was still worth noting, experts said. ""Timely identification of HIV-infected people and provision of effective treatment leads to near normal health and virtual elimination of the risk of HIV transmission,"" said Myron Cohen, from the UNC Institute of Global Health and Infectious Diseases.

Indonesia turns to Global Fund to ensure ARV stock,"The government says there is enough stock of fixed-dose combination ARV medication that contains tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz in one tablet.",['The Jakarta Post'],2019-01-23,The Jakarta Post,"Amid rising concerns about the availability of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy drugs following a failed drug tender, the government has given assurances that stocks are enough until the end of this year. The Health Ministryâ€™s pharmaceutical and medical devices director general, Engko Sosialine Magdalene, said that although the government had failed to procure the drug, people should not worry because there was enough stock of fixed-dose combination ARV medication that contained tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz (FDC TLE) in one tablet. In December, Engko said the ministry had received a grant of 220,000 bottles of FDE TLE from the Global Fund, an international funding organization that fights AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. One bottle contains 30 tablets, which are enough for one month. â€œDont worry and dont panic. Stocks are enough for the next five to six months [...] 220,000 bottles can last until May for users of FDE TLE,â€� Engko told reporters. The government failed to meet an agreement with state-owned pharmaceutical companies PT Kimia Farma and PT Indofarma, which had been appointed to import the drug, sparking anxiety among users of the drug about the possibility of a looming drug crisis. The drug suppresses the virus and prevents fatal infection. Read also: People with HIV/AIDS face drugs scarcity Engko gave assurances that there would be no drug crisis. She said the ministry was preparing to procure more ARV drugs for distribution after May. â€œThe budget allocation for ARV drugs is ready for 2019. We will try our best, so before May, at least in April, we will have the drugs,â€� â€œIf there is another delay in procurement, we have prepared an alternative measure in which we will receive a grant of 564,000 bottles [of FDE TLE] from the Global Fund,â€� she said. Engko also denied there was a scarcity of the drug in several areas. â€œThere is nothing like that. We have a system in place to monitor the availability of drugs in every province. Monitoring in January shows there is no absence of the drug in any region,â€� she said. FDE TLE is the most commonly used drug among people with HIV/AIDS in Indonesia. According to the Indonesia AIDS Coalition (IAC), about 48,000 people, or 42 percent of people with HIV/AIDS, rely on FDE TLE. IAC executive director Aditya Wardhana said the Health Ministry had failed to address the main issue behind the unstable drug supply and the failed tender for FDE TLE, which she claimed was caused by Kimia Farma and Indofarma overpricing the drugs. Kimia Farma sources the ARV drug from Indian pharmaceutical company Hetero Drugs while Indofarma purchases from Mylan, which is based in the United States. The IAC has criticized the way the government procures ARV drugs, saying it makes them the most expensive the world. The IAC claims the drugs can be purchased for almost 25 percent less outside Indonesia. â€œOverpricing the medicine is likely to make the next tender fail, unless the government agrees with the high prices set by the companies,â€� he said on Tuesday. The budget allocated for ARV treatment has increased every year. In 2017, the Health Ministry allocated Rp 1.19 billion (US$84,673) to fund ARV treatment for 112,054 people with HIV. The allocation increased from Rp 243 million in 2015 and is predicted to reach Rp 1.8 trillion by 2020.

Papua aims to cut transmission chain of HIV,The Papua administration is stepping up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV by providing antibody tests to pregnant women seeking healthcare services at hospitals or community health centers.,['The Jakarta Post'],2017-08-29,The Jakarta Post,"The Papua administration is stepping up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV by providing antibody tests to pregnant women seeking healthcare services at hospitals or community health centers. By finding pregnant women who test positive for HIV, health authorities can take measures to prevent the transmission of the chronic disease to their babies. â€œThis is one of the ways to cut the HIV transmission chain in Papua,â€� Papua Health Agency secretary Silwanus Sumule said in a public dialogue in Jayapura on Tuesday. The Health Ministryâ€™s HIV sub-directorate official Triya Novita Dinihari said the government was aiming to achieve the â€œthree zeroesâ€� by 2030, during which Indonesia would see no more new HIV/AIDS infections, AIDS-related deaths or stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (ODHA). Triya said all stakeholders must work together because preventing HIV/AIDS was not the sole responsibility of the Health Ministry. â€œAll societal elements, including religious and traditional leaders and community figures, must be involved. This is because introducing HIV control and prevention in grassroots communities will be effective only if it involves leaders in society,â€� said Triya. Data shows that 97 percent of HIV infections in Papua have been transmitted via sexual intercourse. Around 16,620, 57.57 percent, of total HIV cases in the province affect people at the productive age of between 25 and 49 years.

Genetically modified rice may help prevent HIV,"Researchers from the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain have teamed up to develop a strain of rice that produces HIV-neutralizing proteins.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-08-04,The Jakarta Post,"For many years now, scientists have been altering genomes of plants and animals to achieve various benefits. Recently, new research has found that genetically modified strains of rice can produce HIV-neutralizing proteins, paving the way to end the HIV epidemic. According to Newsweek, researchers from the United Kingdom, the United States and Spain have teamed up to develop a strain of rice that produces HIV-neutralizing proteins. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published the post-lab report where the group described the techniques they used and how the results could be used to prevent the spread of HIV. â€œOur paper provides an approach for the durable deployment of anti-HIV agents in the developing world,â€� the team writes. Infection takes place when the virus interacts with human cells. The transgenic rice produces one antibody and two sugar-biding proteins â€“ the monoclonal antibody 2G12; and the lectins griffithsin and cyanovirin-N â€“ that bind with the HIV virus to prevent further interaction with the human cells. Once the crop has fully grown, the seeds can be ground and processed into a paste that can then be applied to the skin as a topical cream. This will allow the active compounds to enter the body. Read also: Prince Harry joins Elton John to launch HIV campaign targeting men Additionally, the rice seeds can offer an easier platform to produce HIV-preventing medications, as it is cheaper and allows virtually anybody anywhere to have access to the treatment when needed. â€œPlant-produced pharmaceutical proteins can be scaled up very easily and inexpensively without the need for expensive fermenter facilities simply by planting as many plants as needed to achieve a certain production target,â€� team leader Paul Christou told Labiotech.eu (https://labiotech.eu/medical/hiv-prevention-transgenic-rice/). â€œCosts are minimal after the creation of the first plant producing the microbicide. And in our case, the three molecules can be produced in one plant, thus reducing the costs even further.â€� The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that a lot of progress has been made in treating HIV. For instance, US citizens have come a long way: in 1985, about 135,000 were infected but the number dropped to 50,000 in 2010. Unfortunately, an effective vaccine has not yet been developed for HIV.

Based in Bandung, she is currently an activist for the Indonesian Positive Women Network (IPPI), an organization that advocates women with HIV. In accordance with World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, Ayu shared her thoughts and experience with The Jakarta Post regarding the condition. (kes) How did you feel when you first found out that you were HIV-positive? It happened seven years ago. I was diagnosed HIV-positive while taking care of my late husband. I did not know what to do and what was going to happen. For a year, I became anti-social. I chose not to meet with people, unless it was really necessary. Fortunately, my parents, siblings and some of my close friends have been very supportive. Although, at the same time, I also have encountered some people or other relatives that have kept their distance with me upon finding out about my condition. Did you go to a support group? My doctor and other friends I met in hospital suggested to me to join a support group, but I refused. In 2010, after realizing what my parents had done for me, I decided that it was time to get out. The support group meeting returned me back to the real world. I realized that in this world there are a lot of problems and it is not only about my problem. I begun to accept my health condition and moved on. (Read also: A healthy pregnancy is possible for people with HIV) We heard that you have remarried. Can you tell us more about it? How did you tell your husband about your condition? He was the answer to my prayers. In 2012, I returned to a normal life and started to think about my future. I didnâ€™t want to grow old alone. My husband is HIV-negative. Heâ€™s not a HIV activist. In fact, he works in the creative industry. I think itâ€™s positive energy for me [that] heâ€™s coming from a different field. I donâ€™t want to go home [each day] and keep talking about HIV. We got married in 2014. Before taking the big leap, I told him all the consequences of marrying a HIV-positive woman, including the treatment I need to have, the cost and implications of getting pregnant. His family knows about my condition, but we try to keep it to ourselves and not let other relatives find out about this. You moved from Jakarta to Bandung. Did you face any challenges when adapting to this new environment? I had no problems adapting with the new environment. Additionally, the hospital in Bandung has a one-stop service that makes it easier for me. Have you ever encountered friends or acquaintances that were reluctant to share food with you? No. Usually I would be the one who inform them if I have flu or something. (Read also: Most new HIV infections recorded in Jakarta) As a parent, what are the challenges you face? I make sure only certain people know about my health condition. My daughter knows that Iâ€™m HIV-positive, [but] her circle doesnâ€™t know about it. Some may know that Iâ€™m an activist, but thatâ€™s it. People are different; some may need a longer time to understand my health issue. Have you ever experienced discrimination in the workplace? In 2009, I worked as an admin for a music school. It ended badly. That was my first [experience of] discrimination I encountered after [they] found out I was HIV-positive. The news spread to the management. After working for nine months, they asked about it. Although HIV canâ€™t be transmitted from social contact, they asked me to resign. In 2010, I undertook work to support HIV-infected people. At the end of 2012, I joined IPPI. How can we support HIV-positive people? Donâ€™t be ignorant.

Girls and young women made up two-thirds of 15- to 19-year-olds infected with HIV in 2017, according to data unveiled at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Henrietta Fore, head of the UN Childrens Fund (UNICEF), referred to it as a ""crisis of health"". ""In most countries, women and girls lack access to information, to services, or even just the power to say no to unsafe sex,"" she said. ""HIV thrives among the most vulnerable and marginalised, leaving teenage girls at the centre of the crisis."" Last year, 130,000 youngsters aged 19 and under died from AIDS, while 430,000 -- almost 50 every hour -- were newly infected, the agency said. While AIDS-related deaths have decreased since 2010 in all other age groups, among older adolescents aged 15 to 19 they have remained stubbornly constant. About 1.2 million 15- to 19-year-olds were living with the immune system-destroying virus in 2017, three in five of them girls, said UNICEF. ""The epidemics spread among adolescent girls is being fuelled by early sex, including with older males, forced sex, powerlessness in negotiating about sex, poverty, and lack of access to confidential counselling and testing services,"" it pointed out. Actress and activist Charlize Theron raised the issue in an address to conference delegates on Tuesday.

The closure of the Dolly red-light district in Surabaya by Mayor Tri Rismaharini in June this year is feared to have increased the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in a number of nearby regions. NGO Our Right To Be Independent (Orbit) has revealed that some commercial sex workers operating in cities around Surabaya were former inhabitants of Dolly. Â€ÂœWe found a sex worker in Krengseng red-light district, near the Tarik district railway station in Sidoarjo regency, for example, who used to work at Dolly,Â€Â� Orbit activist Witanto said on Tuesday. Increasing numbers of commercial sex workers, he said, were also evident in other neighboring regions such as along the Berantas River embankment in Tulungagung regency. According to Orbit FoundationÂ€Â™s data, increased HIV/AIDS prevalence was also found in Malang, Sidoarjo, Banyuwangi, Mojokerto, Jember, Kediri, Pasuruan and Madiun.

HRW said Indonesian authorities were â€œfueling an HIV epidemicâ€� because of their failure to halt arbitrary and unlawful raids by police and Muslim hard-liners on private LGBT gatherings. â€œThe Indonesian governmentâ€™s failure to address anti-LGBT moral panic is having dire consequences for public health,â€� said HRW LGBT rights researcher and author of the report Kyle Knight. â€œThe Indonesian government should recognize that its role in abuses against LGBT people is seriously compromising the countryâ€™s response to HIV.â€� HRW released Monday a 70-page report titled â€œScared in Public and Now No Privacy: Human Rights and Public Health Impacts of Indonesiaâ€™s Anti-LGBT Moral Panicâ€�. The document outlines ""unlawful"" actions against the LGBT people and contains in-depth interviews with victims and witnesses of alleged abuse, health workers and activists. In Indonesia, LGBT people have long been discriminated against, but public persecution, including by authorities, has risen in recent years â€“ in 2016, a poster about LGBT psychological counseling by an organization comprising University of Indonesia students and alumni fueled a heated debate about LGBT rights. Research, Technology and Higher Education Minister Mohamad Nasir responded to the issue by saying that campuses should not admit as students LGBT people. HRW said widespread stigma and â€œmoral panicâ€� against the LGBT community had discouraged some HIV-vulnerable populations from accessing prevention and treatment services. â€œAs a result, HIV rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) have increased five-fold since 2007 from 5 percent to 25 percent.

Teens living with HIV/AIDS on the rise,"The government has been urged to intensify sex education as the number of teenagers living with HIV/AIDS is on the rise in Yogyakarta province, most cases involving male to male sexual relationships",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-06-16,The Jakarta Post,"The government has been urged to intensify sex education as the number of teenagers living with HIV/AIDS is on the rise in Yogyakarta province, most cases involving male to male sexual relationships. Â€ÂœEach month an average of three to four teenagers are infected with HIV/AIDS,Â€Â� said Muhammad Zaenal Abidin, head of the Edelweis Polyclinic for HIV/AIDS patients at the Dr. Sardjito General Hospital in Yogyakarta on Monday. Abidin said teenagers identified as HIV/AIDS positive were aged between 15 and 20 years old, and already sexually active. This has been the trend for about four years, a change from the previous trend where those infected by the disease were between the ages of 25 and 49 years old, he added. Zaenal said currently teenagers were more inclined to get involved in a sexual relationship, including those with homosexual orientation, due to the presence of social media, which enables them to easily find partners. Â€ÂœSeeking a sexual partner has become very easy, like ordering fried chicken through your smartphone,Â€Â� he said. He believes the education office should be serious and brave enough to provide sex education to teenagers, including conducting campaigns on the use of condoms. Â€ÂœSome of the patients who take anti-retroviral medication are still wearing senior high school uniforms. When I asked them, some said they had been sexually active since junior high school,Â€Â� said Zaenal. He added that over the past six months, Edelweis Polyclinic had seen around 30 patients per month, but around 180 people living with HIV/AIDS visit the clinic each month as of the middle of this year. Â€ÂœSo far, sex education is very deficient as it only concerns anatomy, while discussion of sexual functions remain lacking. If a teenager already has a sex drive, what should he or she do? Lessons on morality are also inadequate,Â€Â� he said. Zaenal added the main cause of HIV/AIDS spreading was no longer the sharing of needles, but sexual contact. Based on data from the Yogyakarta City Health Agency, the number of HIV/AIDS cases totaled 802 last year, an increase from 677 cases the previous year and 561 cases in 2012. The agency said that people living with HIV/AIDS were mostly between 30 and 39 years old (46.9 percent), followed by people under 30 (30 percent) and those from 40 to 49 years old (15.9 percent). Yogyakarta AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA) spokesperson Siti Baruni said the rising number of teenagers with HIV/AIDS was attributed to the condom use campaign in schools being deemed taboo. This is one of the obstacles faced by the Yogyakarta KPA in curbing the HIV/AIDS infection rate. Now, condom advertisements in the media have been limited, as television stations can only air them after 9 p.m., whereas earlier they could be aired anytime,Â€Â� said Siti. HIV/AIDS counselor Nuraini said parents should supervise their childrenÂ€Â™s social interactions more seriously. Â€ÂœA childÂ€Â™s surroundings are very influential, for instance a teenager could become homosexual for often being in some environments, or experiencing sexual abuse,Â€Â� she said.

"In Surakarta, speaking about life after HIV",Courageous: Agus says that he became infected with HIV when he was a drug addict,['The Jakarta Post'],2014-12-03,The Jakarta Post,"The 38-year-old said that she found out that she contracted the virus in 2009. Â€ÂœI was frustrated for eight days,Â€Â� she said. Eventually, Sutarti found out that her late husband had infected her. Â€ÂœAll I knew that my husband was sick, was hospitalized and died. I did not know that he was infected by HIV/AIDS.Â€Â� Sutarti has no idea how her husband got infected. His death Â€Â” and the revelation of her status Â€Â” were things that she had never prepared for. Â€ÂœI was confused. I wondered on how would I pay for my education? For my family and kids?Â€Â� She did not receive a lot of support from those closest to her, despite her mounting tribulations, Sutarti said. Many members of her family, her brothers and sisters and neighbors chose to avoid her after learning of her infection. Â€ÂœA lot of people had negative perceptions of me because I had HIV back then.Â€Â� Another former housewife, Islamiyah, told the crowd a story that was much the same. She was also infected by her husband, only finding out that she had contracted HIV after her sick husband was hospitalized. Â€ÂœI was shocked and devastated,Â€Â� Islamiyah, who wore a red ribbon to promote awareness of HIV, said. However, the 43-year-old said that she did not blame her husband for what happened to her. Â€ÂœI have no grudge and I hold no anger toward my husband. This is probably GodÂ€Â™s will,Â€Â� she said. Since Islamiyah found out about her status five years ago, she has regularly participated in a therapy program at Moewardi Hospital in Solo. Like Sutarti, Islamiyah also faced discrimination from her community and her family. Â€ÂœFortunately, my children continue to give me support,Â€Â� she said. As time goes by, those close to Islamiyah began to accept her condition. To help eradicate discrimination against HIV patients, Sutarti and Islamiyah work for NGO Lentera, which provides assistance for those infected by the virus and education programs to stop the spread of the disease. Another HIV sufferer, Agus Badrullah, said that discrimination against HIV patients was still prevalent within the community. Â€ÂœFor example, nobody wants to use the same utensils we use to eat Â€Â” despite the fact that doing so cannot transfer the HIV infection. Some doctors even tell us to prepare a good grave once they know our status. This is very ironic,Â€Â� he said. His story differed from the womenÂ€Â™s. Agus, a drug addict since 1990, found out he was infected in 2006. Â€ÂœWhen I went to Moerwadi Hospital, my HIV status was already at level 4. My eyes were almost blind. I could not breathe, and I was so skinny like an alien,Â€Â� he said. Agus Badrullah said that all he could think about was death, until other people reached out and gave him hope. Â€ÂœFortunately, a lot of activist friends accompanied me and gave me support,Â€Â� he said. Â€ÂœBeing infected by HIV/AIDS is not the end of everything.Â€Â� He has since benefitted from regular therapy and medication. Most of the estimated 1,400 people diagnosed with the virus in Surakarta are transgendered people, men having sex with men, intravenous drug users, women sex workers and pregnant women, and people with tuberculosis and hepatitis, according to the Surakarta Health Agency. However, only about 500 Â€Â” less than 40 percent Â€Â” are receiving treatment, according to Tommy Prawoto, the head of the Surakarta office of the National AIDS Commission. Traditional Javanese attitudes towards sex and the stigmatization of those with HIV added to the problem. People living with HIV Â€Âœare embarrassed because of the negative view of society, which leads them to shut down Â€Â“ or even to leave town,Â€Â� Tommy said.

HIV/AIDS positive children left out in cold,"Life has never been easy for children living with HIV/AIDS, a cruel disease that requires costly daily treatments.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-03-02,The Jakarta Post,"Life has never been easy for children living with HIV/AIDS, a cruel disease that requires costly daily treatments. But what makes their lives even more difficult is the fact that neither the government nor the public seem to be willing to help them. In many cases, society only makes their lives harder. Rumah Singgah Lentera, a local NGO that provides protection for 11 HIV/AIDS children in Surakarta, Central Java, said it had been struggling to provide support for the children due to resistance from local residents. Since its establishment in 2012, the organization and children have been forced to move from one location to another after being rejected by local residents. They currently live in a house provided by a local cleric in the Laweyan area. The children, who are aged between 2 to 14 years old and come from Surakarta and several other cities like Salatiga and Boyolali in Central Java and Ngawi in East Java, have been forced to move from one school to another as some parents objected to their presence in fear they would transmit their disease to other students. The Surakarta city administration has offered them housing in the Punggawan area, but the plan has been suspended, again, due to rejection from locals. Meanwhile, Rumah Singgah Lentera has had to work hard to get enough money to support the 11 children. The NGO spends around Rp 10 million (US$750) for children every month. Routine health checks and drugs were covered by the Surakarta administration. Eight children have been registered with the cityâ€™s Citizens Health Assistance (BKMKS) program. The remaining three were supported by the Child Social Welfare Program (PKSA), which only gave Rp 1.1 million per child for a year. However, apart from the health services, Lentera has to bear all other costs to look after the children, including food, clothes and education. â€œApart from the treatment, we need to fulfill all of the childrenâ€™s needs on our own with money that we gather among ourselves [the managers] or funds from donor contributions and aid from social agencies,â€� Lentera manager Puger Mulyono said. Puger, whom the children referred to as ayah (father), said Lentera also needed to bear all the costs when they traveled out of town to pick up HIV/AIDS-positive children who had been cast out from families that were no longer willing to look after them for various reasons. One time, Puger said, Lentera went to pick up an AIDS-positive boy who had been brought by his family to Blitar Social Services in East Java. The latter contacted Lentera because it did not have a service or program to take care of the child, who needed intensive treatment for his illness. â€œIndonesia has not yet established an agency to take care of children living with HIV/AIDS. Maybe Lentera was the first one to initiate it,â€� Puger, who co-founded Lentera with his friend Yunus Prasetyo, said. UNICEF child specialist Naning Julianingsih asserted the importance for the government to create an integrated system and services to support children living with HIV/AIDS, since social assistance alone was far from enough, especially when their parents or guardians passed away. â€œThese children cannot go alone to hospitals to access ARV therapy. A system should be established, such as an accessible program that provides intensive treatment to prevent HIV-positive children from becoming AIDS-positive,â€� she said. She added the government should find solutions for children living with HIV/AIDS to have their rights to health care and education fulfilled, such as providing home-schooling and intensive treatment inside their houses for those unable to go out. Surakarta Mayor FX Hadi â€œRudyâ€� Rudyatmo has expressed his unwavering support for the organization and would work to raise public awareness about HIV/ AIDS. â€œThese children need to be taken care of.â€�",{},"['program', 'surakarta', 'hivaids', 'support', 'positive', 'children', 'treatment', 'social', 'local', 'lentera', 'left', 'cold', 'living']","Life has never been easy for children living with HIV/AIDS, a cruel disease that requires costly daily treatments.

PLWHA walks across country to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS,"Wijianto from Nganjuk, East Java, is pictured with Cirebon AIDS Prevention Commission head Sri Maryati at Cirebon City Hall after giving a lecture at a local university on Monday",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"Wijianto, 30, a person living with HIV/AIDs is on a mission to raise awareness of the conditions and to eliminate the stigma attached to people with the condition by traversing the country on foot. Wijianto, aka Gareng, said on Monday that there was discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Gareng chose to walk to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and on the importance of healthy living. He said he wanted to change the misconception that PLWHA were weak, sickly, useless and no better than garbage. By walking, he wants to show people that PLWHA are healthy and can be beneficial to society. ""I call this mission Cruising the Country on Foot to Promote [awareness of] HIV/AIDS. The purpose is also to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, support other PLWHAs, eliminate the stigma and discrimination against PLWHAs,"" he told kompas.com. Gareng started his journey when he stepped out of his house in Jakarta on Nov. 7 on his 33rd birthday. He walked more than 210 kilometers from Jakarta to Cirebon. During his journey, he passed through several cities in West Java, such as Bogor, Ciawi, Sukabumi, Cianjur, Cimahi, Bandung, Sumedang and Majalengka, before arriving in Cirebon. The Nganjuk, East Java, native will continue his trip on foot as far as the eastern part of the country. He plans to walk through Central Java, East Java, Bali, Makassar, Kendari, Ambon, Manokwari, Halmahera, Gorontalo, Manado, Palu and other areas. Gareng aims to complete his mission after two years in November 2017. He is carrying only clothes, maps, notebooks, medicines and antiretrovial drugs to help his immune system. Everything is kept in a backpack bearing a poster reading ""cruising the country on foot to prevent the spread of HIV and support infected people"". A small Indonesian flag also hangs from his bag. Gareng said he faced many challenges on his mission because many people doubted that he would be able to walk far. However, his strong determination to promote HIV/AIDS prevention so that no one will find themselves in the same position as him keeps him on his feet. His only daughter, he said, was his biggest supporter. ""In 2012, I had my daughter checked by a doctor and she is healthy and [HIV] negative. It raised my spirits and determination to start this long mission,"" he said. Discrimination Gareng told kompas.com that initially he was diagnosed with TB and respiratory problems caused by drugs. The count on his CD4 cells, a type of white blood cells that fight infection, dropped drastically to 24 from the normal range of 500 to1,500. He also had blisters on his body and blood spots on his face, mouth and body. ""At that time I was diagnosed as HIV positive. Nurses should have understood [the illness], but they did not. They seemed to be scared, stayed away from me and even acted disgusted. No one even wanted to accept money from me to buy food,"" he said at the Cirebon AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA) without further details on when he was diagnosed. His wife also gradually became estranged as she was scared of his condition. Â€Â˜PutawÂ€Â™ addiction Gareng said he worked in a furniture shop in Surabaya in 2002. From there he became involved with people addicted to putaw (low-grade heroin). He refused to try the drug at first but eventually succumbed to the temptation and became addicted. He used it regularly for three years until 2005. ""In 2005, my family learned of my addiction and took me home to be treated,"" he said. During treatment, he suffered sakaw (withdrawal symptoms) until he was gradually cured of his addiction. Gareng then moved to Jakarta to start a new life. He worked as a security officer in 2011. He often worked the night shift, which he says left him vulnerable to lung disease. It was at that time that he was diagnosed as having HIV. Tribunnews.com reported that National Population and Family Planning Board (BKKBN) head Surya Chandra Surapty said last week that as of June 2015, there were 178,000 people living with HIV and 67,000 AIDS cases in Indonesia.

45 Yogya bus drivers test positive for HIV/AIDS,Self awareness: A bus driver undergoes an HIV test during the celebration of World AIDS Day 2015 in Yogyakarta on Tuesday,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The Yogyakarta Health Agency says that from 1993 to September 2015, 45 bus drivers tested positive for HIV/AIDS in the province. Referring to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, which says that one HIV-positive person represents 10 people, it is calculated that in reality, 450 people in the employment group have the deadly viral infection. ""People who work in the transportation sector are among those with a high risk of at least becoming part of the transmission chain of HIV,"" Yogyakarta AIDS Commission (KPA Yogyakarta) secretary Riswanto said on the sidelines of a seminar on HIV/AIDS control in Yogyakarta on Tuesday. Dozens of bus drivers and civil servants attended the seminar, which was held by the Yogyakarta Transportation, Communication and Informatics Agency. The Transportation Ministry has been appointed as the leading sector in the commemoration of World AIDS Day 2015, which falls on Dec.1. At the event, the Yogyakarta Health Agency offered free HIV tests and 13 men agreed to take the tests voluntarily. ""In tackling the spread of HIV/AIDS, we should recognize people belonging to the 3M group, or Men Mobile with Money,"" said Riswanto. This group has been identified as men who work far from their wives, giving them an opportunity to have sex with people other than their partners. If those men, who frequently work as drivers, seamen or transportation workers, are infected with HIV, there is a chance that they will transmit the disease to their wives or partners. ""Drivers and transportation workers must begin to adopt a healthy lifestyle and avoid behavior with a high risk of getting HIV, such as changing sex partners without using condoms,"" said Riswanto. He said if the drivers and transportation workers had been involved in risky behavior, they needed to immediately take an HIV test. The sooner they knew their HIV status, the better HIV treatment they would receive. GeGe Transport tour bus driver Tri Wahyu said he decided to take the HIV test at the event because he wanted to know whether or not he tested positive for HIV. ""There was a time I repeatedly had sex with women who were not my wife,"" said Wahyu. He explained that most drivers were engaged in behavior with a high risk of getting HIV, such as having sex with commercial sex workers. In doing so many of them used condoms while others chose not to do so. ""Those drivers claim that they have sex with commercial sex workers to heal their stress while some say that they want to try new techniques in having sex,"" said Wahyu. The Yogyakarta administrationÂ€Â™s assistant secretary for governance and peopleÂ€Â™s prosperity, Sulistyo, said it was hoped that HIV/AIDS in Yogyakarta and Indonesia could be controlled. He said that medical treatment for an HIV/AIDS infected person was quite costly and this could disrupt the national economy. ""People who test positive for HIV/AIDS will usually have lower productivity,"" said Sulistyo. The Yogyakarta Health Agency recorded that from 1993 to September 2015, 3,146 people tested positive for HIV. Of the total, 1,249 went on to develop AIDS.

However, there were issues surrounding the needs of children with HIV, including discrimination. â€œWhen we talk about children with AIDS, people automatically think about premarital sex and other things, while actually [what they should focus on is that] these are only children,â€� he told The Jakarta Post, adding that the issue led to a lack of human resources to help the children. â€œOur program is among the most well-received because it is aimed at children. The discrimination is less strong, but it still exists.â€� Read also: Striving for zero discrimination Irwanto also cited a lack of knowledge, neglect from family members and low economic power as other issues in caring for the children. â€œAnother challenge is convincing the children that they always need to take their medicine at a fixed time,â€� he said.

Premarital HIV testing: Are we aware of the consequences?,"A new local regulation enforcing mandatory premarital HIV testing has just been endorsed by the Bogor city mayor, Bima Arya Sugiarto",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-02-13,The Jakarta Post,"A new local regulation enforcing mandatory premarital HIV testing has just been endorsed by the Bogor city mayor, Bima Arya Sugiarto. It requires couples who wish to marry to conduct HIV tests to be able to gain their marriage certificates. This regulation comes in the wake of increasing cases of HIV and AIDS in Bogor. Two kinds of HIV testing procedures are approved by the Health Ministry: voluntary counseling and testing and health provider-initiated testing and counseling. Both procedures include counseling and are not mandatory. For the latter service, one can decline to take the offered HIV test. Mandatory premarital HIV testing in Bogor will be the first regulation in Indonesia that obliges people to undergo HIV testing. Mandatory premarital HIV testing has become a controversial requirement for issuing a marriage certificate in many countries, including in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia and Cambodia. The proponents believe that mandatory HIV testing will protect those who are not yet infected with HIV from their potentially infected partners. Mandatory premarital HIV testing is also hoped to reduce the number of people who engage in risky sexual behavior by indirectly promoting sexual abstinence before marriage. Critics cite human rights concerns such as infringement of the right to privacy, the right to marry and to establish a family. Other critics link the regulation to poor public health consequences, such as a false sense of security among the bridal candidates if they test negative for HIV. An HIV test result is only relevant when the test is conducted. Moreover, a person who gets a negative HIV test result today can still get infected in the future, should he or she engage in unprotected sex with someone infected with HIV or has an unknown status. This false sense of security, combined with ignorance, will make people more vulnerable to HIV infection. Another problem is that in many countries, including Indonesia, HIV and AIDS and the people affected are still subject to stigma and discrimination. Mandatory premarital HIV testing will result in people avoiding the test, as well as preventing people from disclosing their HIV status to others, including future partners, and may lead to people obtaining fake HIV status certificates or opting for non-legal or unregistered marriages. Another impact will be cancelations of marriage proposals as a result of the HIV status of one or both of the bridal candidates. Mandatory premarital HIV testing regulations for bridal candidates potentially harm women more than men. Firstly, if the HIV test results are negative for both bridal candidates, the bride may face difficulties in negotiating safer sex practices within marriage. This will affect her health, including her risk of contracting HIV. Secondly, if the HIV test result of the bride is positive, then she will be more vulnerable to experience violence, discrimination and abandonment from her partner, family, workplace and wider community. Thirdly, if the bride is positive and she is already pregnant, her vulnerability to violence increases, as risk of violence is often higher during pregnancy. Finally, HIV-positive women who are getting married may not necessarily want to disclose their HIV status to their future husband due to fear of wedding cancelation, shame, violence and other discrimination related to her HIV status. The results of a study show that women living with HIV do not have good adherence to HIV treatment when they do not disclose their status, as they have to get their medicine in secret. These situations are counterproductive and prevent women living with HIV from accessing and receiving necessary care, treatment and services, including prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. These potential impacts of mandatory HIV testing contradict the intention of the Bogor mayor and the National HIV program, which aim to minimize new HIV infections and protect the rights and health of people living with HIV and AIDS. Instead of introducing this regulation, more effective steps could be taken, such as promoting HIV testing among the general population (or wider community), including to young people and couples of child-rearing age, together with efforts to step up comprehensive and quality education on HIV. The focus should rather be on increasing access to voluntary counseling and testing services for high-risk groups and the general population; promoting voluntary couple counseling; encouraging people who take voluntary tests to voluntarily disclose their HIV status to their spouses; and ensuring that bridal candidates have access to HIV care, support and treatment services, should one or both test positive for HIV. The mandatory premarital HIV testing regulation should be changed into a regulation offering and encouraging voluntary HIV testing for bridal candidates as part of the standard procedure by the Religious Affairs Office (KUA), which issues marriage certificates for Muslims, or by HIV counselors and health providers. In this case, bridal candidates need a guarantee that their rejection of voluntary HIV testing will not influence further services provided for them. HIV counselors must be better equipped with knowledge around gender, sexuality and violence, as well as skills in couple counseling, violence counseling and HIV disclosure counseling, to encourage people to reveal their HIV status. Access to HIV care, support and treatment services need to be improved and brought closer to the community, including referral services for HIV and AIDS-related cases of violence. __________________ The writer is a researcher at the Atma Jaya HIV AIDS Research Center.

Speaking at the launch, which also featured South African actress Charlize Theron and Ndaba Mandela, the grandson of late President Nelson Mandela, Elton John said: â€œIf we want to end AIDS once and for all, we must make men part of the solution.â€� Around 36.7 million people around the world have HIV, according to 2016 figures cited by the United Nationsâ€™ HIV/AIDS body UNAIDS.

Such cases are continuing to rise due to increased international exchanges, the specialist added. The latest figure compares with 1,500 cases recorded in July last year covering the previous three years. Despite an increase in cases among expatriates, the governments anti-AIDS efforts, particularly free medication, will focus only on Chinese citizens due to limited funding. This was made clear by Wu Zunyou, head of the National Center for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Disease Control and Prevention. It means most foreign patients are not covered by Chinas AIDS intervention system, which includes a patients follow-up monitoring network and free antiviral medication. At least 9,000 foreigners have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS on the mainland since the centers epidemic surveillance system started operating in 2005. But the center does not know if they are still in China. The majority of expatriates with HIV/AIDS are aged between 20 and 45 and at least half of them became infected through heterosexual activities. The second leading cause was intravenous drug use. Wu said most of these foreigners lived in Yunnan, Guangdong and Fujian provinces and Beijing. They underwent HIV testing at various outlets. These included voluntary free testing clinics run by the government, institutions carrying out premarital medical checks, and border checkpoints during random screening. Zhao Yan, a treatment specialist at the national center, said foreigners confirmed to have HIV must pay for their own treatment, adding that there are exceptions in Yunnan. This province had nearly half of the total foreigners with the disease, with most of them coming from neighboring countries such as Myanmar and Vietnam.

"Love and HIV in Wamena, as seen on film",Fighting footage: A tribe in Jayawijaya performs a dance that was later used to dramatic effect in the film,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-06-18,The Jakarta Post,"Â€ÂœThe dream was there, but now itÂ€Â™s gone,Â€Â� sings Litius, the protagonist of a new film about HIV/AIDS in Papua. Ukulele in tow, Litius sings of loss, of a future affected by HIV that he feels can never be fulfilled, but in truth, Cinta Dari Wamena (From Wamena with Love) rails against that vision. It is a film of hope and renewal. Supported by the district government of Jayawijaya, Papua; the Australian governmentÂ€Â™s aid agency (AusAID); and the Ford Foundation, Cinta Dari Wamena tries to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS across Indonesia. Â€ÂœThe movie highlights the need for awareness of what HIV is and how it can be prevented, both for our own health and so we can share that knowledge with our friends and family, said AusAID acting head in Indonesia Mat Kimberley, at the filmÂ€Â™s premiere in Jakarta. In the movie, teenagers Litius (Maximus Itlay), Tembi (Benjamin Lagowan) and Martha (Madonna Marrey) leave their village in Papua and head to the town of Wamena in search of a better education. There, they meet new friends and are exposed to new influences and dangers, the biggest of which is HIV/AIDS. ItÂ€Â™s no co-incidence the film is set in Papua province. According to UNICEF Indonesia, Papua has a HIV rate almost 15 times higher than the national average. The National AIDS Commission (KPA) says the provinces of Papua and West Papua are experiencing a low-level HIV epidemic. About 30,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV in the provinces today. Nor is it by chance the film focuses on youth. The prevalence of HIV among 15-to-24-year-olds in the two provinces is thought to be even higher than the general population there. All the more reason then, for a film like this to connect with younger generations by hitting the big screens of Indonesia. Directed by Lasja Susatyo, the film keeps it nice and simple. Thankfully, thereÂ€Â™s no complex plot or attention-grabbing side effects to be had. With a sprinkling of humor, the film rightly focuses on increasing understanding of HIV, debunking some of its myths while warning of the paths that lead to infection. Lasja strikes a good balance. The film shows how HIV is almost entirely spread by unsafe sex in Papua and West Papua, through a combination of prostitution, high levels of unaccompanied men moving around the provinces and the inhibition-busting affects of alcohol consumption. Perceptions of HIV are dealt with too. Early on in the film, the three protagonists watch as an old man is driven away from their village. Â€ÂœHe has been cursed by God,Â€Â� says a villager. The reality is that the man is being ostracized because he has HIV, attitudes that still prevail in the two provinces and the world over. Shot amid the beautiful Papuan landscape, the film points to how a lack of education and teacher absenteeism in rural areas provide the backdrop for ignorance and myths of HIV to take root. ThereÂ€Â™s worries about the virus being airborne, thereÂ€Â™s resistance to testing and to taking subscribed antiretroviral (ARV) drugs Â€Â” free in Indonesia Â€Â” that are required to suppress the virus. These drugs have hugely reduced the death rates and suffering of people living with HIV worldwide. At the center of it all is the star-crossed relationship between Litius and the introverted Endah (Amyra Jessica), and their journey toward a truth Â€Â” terrible and unspeakable at first Â€Â” that will affect the rest of their lives. The film is currently showing in cinemas across the country, but its success will depend less on cinema ratings than its ability to reach out to audiences that do not have access to the big screen. With the help of local governments, NGOs, schools and universities, there are plans to screen the film and host discussions in Jakarta, Central Java, East Java, South Sulawesi, Papua and West Papua. All profits from the film in theatres will also be donated to Jayawijaya and other districts in Papua to help raise awareness. Despite being released only this month, the filmÂ€Â™s Facebook page already has almost 5,000 likes and a Cinta Dari Wamena movement has even been started on the filmÂ€Â™s website (cintadariwamena.com), which is looking for volunteers to campaign on HIV/AIDS via social media. However, reaching HIV-affected remote areas, particularly in West Papua and Papua, which have little access to technology, will be key if this film is to make serious inroads into complimenting the array of awareness raising work already being taken forward by local authorities, church groups and local and international NGOs in the two provinces. The intention is to take the film to these areas, but in urban settings at least, the film looks set to get people talking about the HIV taboo. Carrying a message of hope that there is life after HIV, the film should help to reduce stigma and resonate with audiences, just like the pangs of LitiusÂ€Â™ ukulele strings.",{},"['love', 'provinces', 'litius', 'hiv', 'papua', 'theres', 'film', 'seen', 'west', 'local', 'indonesia', 'wamena']","'Â€ÂœThe dream was there, but now it'Â€Â™s gone,'Â€Â� sings Litius, the protagonist of a new film about HIV/AIDS in Papua.

Hope abounds for new RI leaders to take firm stance on HIV/AIDS,"In the history of public health, HIV/AIDS has been exceptional -- it has had widespread and long-lasting demographic, social, economic and political impact incomparable to any other health issue",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-10-08,The Jakarta Post,"Under a scholarship from the International AIDS Society (IAS) and with support from the United Nations Joint Program on AIDS (UNAIDS), The Jakarta PostÂ€Â™s Rita A. Widiadana attended the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia, to learn more about global progress in HIV/AIDS responses, including in Indonesia. The following are reports from the five-day conference. The recent International AIDS conference, organized by the Geneva-based International AIDS Society and its partners including UNAIDS and the WHO, attracted 13,000 delegate members from around the world and ended with a global chorus of international figures, including former US president Bill Clinton and humanitarian activist and musician Bob Geldof, scientists and civil society groups hoping to end the AIDS epidemic by the year 2030. Such a task will not be easy, however, especially for developing nations like Indonesia, which is facing tremendous public health and social problems. During the five-day conference, Indonesia was in the global spotlight for all the wrong reasons, being named one of the few countries where HIV infection has significantly increased in recent years. HIV/AIDS constitutes a major challenge for IndonesiaÂ€Â™s new leaders, as it is more than a health issue. For Indonesia, the scale of the societal and economic impact of HIV/AIDS could be disastrous, as the disease can reverse a countryÂ€Â™s annual economic growth by 1 or 2 percent if it is not properly managed. Economic wealth in the form of gross national product (GNP) could drop in some areas by as much as 40 percent by 2020. Translated to a country like Malaysia, Thailand or Indonesia, this is a sum worth billions of dollars, according to a report from an Australian donor agency. Â€ÂœWhile new infections continue to decrease globally, we unfortunately are seeing a very different pattern in several countries in our region, with increasing number of infections in Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines in 2013,Â€Â� explained Sharon Lewin, co-chair of the conference and one of the International AIDS SocietyÂ€Â™s (IAS) team of global researchers. UNAIDS data show there were 35 million people living with HIV worldwide in 2013. Geographically, the majority of people living with HIV have been found in 20 countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa but also in larger middle-income countries such as China, Brazil, India, Russia, Thailand and Indonesia. In the Asia and Pacific region, there were 4.8 million people living with HIV, including 350,000 new HIV infections in the region in 2013. In Indonesia, where the first HIV/AIDS case was discovered in Bali in l987, the number of people living with HIV was estimated at 640,000 by UNAIDS data in 2013. Demographically, in every region in the world, HIV/AIDS shows high prevalence among certain groups, including men having sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), sex workers and their clients, transgender people, prisoners, migrants, pregnant women and their babies. Similarly, in Indonesia, a high incidence of HIV infection among men having sex with men is found in Jakarta (15 to 17 percent) and other big cities. The incidence among intravenous drug users (IDU) is 36.4 percent. In Jayawijaya, Papua, HIV rates among female sex workers are as high as 25 percent, and 18 percent for male sex workers. Around 30.8 percent of waria (transgenders) people in Jakarta are HIV positive. Steve Kraus, UNAIDS Asia and Pacific regional director, told The Jakarta Post: Â€ÂœThe newly elected leaders of Indonesia must be briefed on the real situation of HIV/AIDS in Indonesia, its current program and the mounting challenges Indonesia is now facing.Â€Â� Michel SidibÃƒÂ©, UNAIDS executive director, told the Post that Indonesia had been implementing beneficial and innovative programs in scaling up testing and treatment for people living with HIV in the last two years. Â€ÂœThe country has optimized all resources Â€Â” in the fields of policy making, funding, investment and human resources Â€Â” to give opportunities for people living with HIV to get health access, which has resulted in the identification of new HIV infections,Â€Â� SidibÃƒÂ© added. Â€ÂœIndonesia is taking dramatic steps to slow the rate of new infections. More recent initiatives aimed at increasing access to testing and treatment are leading the way,Â€Â� added Kraus. Under Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi, Indonesia has been taking progressive and bold action by greatly expanding HIV testing, counseling and treatment services. Early initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) can now be offered to people living with HIV including pregnant women in 10 districts across the countryÂ€Â™s 33 provinces. By the end of 2014, the program will be expanded to 72 districts. Indonesia also plans to become one of several countries in the region to offer universal care by 2014, with HIV treatment included in health coverage. Â€ÂœExpanding HIV treatment is part of the Indonesian governmentÂ€Â™s drive to meet the Millennium Development Goals and stamp out AIDS,Â€Â� Mboi said. Given IndonesiaÂ€Â™s size and diffusion, a central challenge now will be ensuring that the ministryÂ€Â™s directives are implemented at local level. HIV/AIDS activists are also hopeful that the new government will listen to them and work alongside them. Vinolia Wakijo, a prominent defender of transgender people and sex workers in Yogyakarta, said that implementing the AIDS response without involving affected groups would be almost impossible. Â€ÂœBu Naf [Nafsiah Mboi] is a minister who has an open mind and heart as she has invited [transgender people and sex workers], as well as MSM and people injecting drugs, to be part of the solution,Â€Â� Vinolia said. Tono Permana, coordinator of a national network for men who have sex with men and transgender people, applauded the program. Dede Oetomo, founder of Gaya Nusantara, a leading gay rights advocacy group, said he was hoping that president-elect Joko Â€ÂœJokowiÂ€Â� Widodo would have an open mind and an innovative program. Â€ÂœHIV is more than just a public health threat. It encompasses deep social, cultural and religious stigma and discrimination against the affected people.

World awaits effective and affordable HIV/AIDS cure,"Prestigious recognition: Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi (center) poses with members of the Indonesian civil society group, Persaudaraan Korban Napza Indonesia (PKNI) or the Brotherhood for Indonesian Drug Users",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-10-08,The Jakarta Post,"Out of hundreds of sessions held during the 20th International AIDS Conference, a scientific session Â€Â” Toward HIV Cure Â€Â” stole the attention of all participants and the world, who watched eagerly for news on effective and affordable cures for HIV/AIDS. Â€ÂœWe have plenty of data telling us we can make and we have made progress,Â€Â� FranÃƒÂ§oise BarrÃƒÂ©-Sinnoussi, president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, told international journalists. Winner of the Nobel Prize as a co-discoverer of the HIV virus, BarrÃƒÂ©-Sinnoussi has been one of the driving forces behind global scientistsÂ€Â™ attempts to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. Â€ÂœWe will need to collaborate and combine different approaches to HIV Â€Â” work on cures as well as therapies, prevention and vaccines Â€Â” and strengthen the relationships between researchers to continue to make progress in tackling HIV.Â€Â� BarrÃƒÂ©-Sinoussi said. Â€ÂœIt is now my duty to get researchers from around the world working together to find better ways to treat and prevent HIV.Â€Â� In the 32 years since scientists discovered HIV, world researchers have gained greater understanding of the its underlying causes, preventions and treatment methods. Since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a shocking report in 1981 describing a rare and horrific illness that caused severe fever, fatigue and weight loss, mostly affecting gay men and killing many of them, scientists have been working toward finding a cure. The search for a HIV cure began when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first treatment option, known as Zidovudine or AZT. When antiretroviral treatment (ART) was unveiled at the 1996 International AIDS Conference in Vancouver, Canada, AIDS was transformed into a treatable and manageable disease. Â€ÂœBut ART remained expensive. While AIDS became a manageable disease in Western countries, it was still viewed as a death sentence in most developing countries,Â€Â�explained Sharon Lewin, professor of medicine at Monash University in Melbourne and co-chair of AIDS 2014 Conference. The cost of HIV/AIDS treatments is too much for patients in developing countries, averaging at US$25,000 per year per person. ART options for HIV patients were further expanded with the FDAÂ€Â™s approval of fusion inhibitors in March 2003 and entry inhibitors in August 2007. Between 2009 and 2010, many ART drug therapies were approved in generic form, making them more affordable and thus more acceptable to HIV/AIDS patients worldwide. In developing countries with mid to high HIV/AIDS incidence, ART remained unattainable, even when costs had dropped to about $10,000 per patient per year in 2000 and to less than $100 by 2010. But the treatment has become simple. Â€ÂœIn the past, patients with HIV had to consume 20 pills a day. Now patients only have to consume one pill per day,Â€Â� added Lewin. In 2012, IAS launched its global scientific strategy to find a cure for HIV, involving more than 200 of the worldÂ€Â™s leading AIDS scientists and researchers. LewinÂ€Â™s research was among the most groundbreaking: Â€Â�Traditional antiretroviral [ARV] medications have been able to stop the virus infecting cells, giving patients a greater life expectancy, but the virus remained hiding in their DNA, unable to be found and treated so that patients still had to undergo expensive lifelong ART.Â€Â� By using the cancer drug Vorinostat for two weeks, Lewin and her team were able to rouse the sleeping HIV-infected cells so they could be detected. Â€ÂœIt was a kind of shock-and-kill the virus.Â€Â� Seeking out the killer virus with doses of a highly toxic cancer drug was a huge step in curing the disease once viewed as incurable. One of the most talked-about studies presented during the conference discussed the viability of such a method. Danish researchers have found a way to activate and expose hidden HIV cells to the immune system Â€Â” a major step toward finding a cure for the virus affecting 38 million people. Ole SÃƒÂ¸gaard, a doctor from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, said a study of six HIV-positive patients showed that a cancer drug, Romidepsin, could Â€Â˜Â€Â™kickÂ€Â™Â€Â™ HIV out of its hiding place and into the bloodstream, where it could theoretically be attacked by the immune system. The finding has been hailed as the single most important advance reported at the AIDS 2014 conference. SÃƒÂ¸gaard said while patientsÂ€Â™ immune systems did not destroy the virus, a new trial involving 20 patients would combine this Â€ÂœkickÂ€Â� approach with an experimental HIV vaccine (Vacc-4x) to see if it could stimulate an immune response strong enough to kill the virus. Steven Deeks, professor of medicine at the University of California, said the Danish research was likely to have a huge impact on HIV research worldwide. Â€ÂœOleÂ€Â™s data is the first clear evidence, at least to me, that we can truly identify the latent reservoir, the hidden virus, and shock it out of its hiding place,Â€Â� he said. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told conference-goers that a HIV cure may come down to two possibilities Â€Â” eradicating the virus or driving it so far underground that people donÂ€Â™t need therapy, even if the HIV is still lurking somewhere. Fauci further said that an effective cure for HIV would have to have three characteristics: It would have to be simple and easy to administer, with no need for tertiary care; it would have to be at least as safe as the antiretroviral therapy; and it would have to be scalable and affordable enough to treat millions of HIV patients. - JP/Rita A.Widiadana",{},"['effective', 'hivaids', 'virus', 'international', 'affordable', 'hiv', 'patients', 'drug', 'treatment', 'scientists', 'researchers', 'world', 'awaits', 'cure', 'aids']","Out of hundreds of sessions held during the 20th International AIDS Conference, a scientific session 'Â€Â” Toward HIV Cure 'Â€Â” stole the attention of all participants and the world, who watched eagerly for news on effective and affordable cures for HIV/AIDS.

156 housewives live with HIV/AIDS,"HIV/AIDS had infected at least 156 housewives and 31 children aged between 2 and 9 years old in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) between 2001 and July this year, data at the provincial AIDS Mitigation Commission (KPAP) revealed",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-10-31,The Jakarta Post,"HIV/AIDS had infected at least 156 housewives and 31 children aged between 2 and 9 years old in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) between 2001 and July this year, data at the provincial AIDS Mitigation Commission (KPAP) revealed. The data showed that of the 156 infected housewives, 68 were HIV positive while the remaining 88 had AIDS. Head of the KPAP NTB secretariat, Soeharmanto, said that the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in NTB had started to increase in the last five years. Â€ÂœThis needs to be anticipated as the disease affects not only people of high risk, such as prostitutes and drug users, but also housewives and children,Â€Â� Soeharmanto told The Jakarta Post in Mataram on Wednesday. The same data also revealed that the number of housewives living with HIV/AIDS was higher than that of commercial sex workers, of whom 62 were HIV positive and 12 had AIDS. In total, Soeharmanto said, there had been 912 cases of HIV/AIDS in NTB between 2001 and July 2014, of which 408 were HIV cases and 504 were AIDS cases. Of the 504 cases of AIDS, 216 had died and the remaining 288 were still undergoing medical treatment. Cases of HIV/AIDS in NTB, according to Soeharmanto, were spread evenly in the provinceÂ€Â™s 10 regencies and municipalities, comprising Mataram and Bima cities and the regencies of West Lombok, Central Lombok, East Lombok, North Lombok, West Sumbawa, Sumbawa, Dompu and Bima. Â€ÂœThe combined increase of HIV/AIDS cases in NTB is indeed concerning, [...] the known data only accounts for the tip of the iceberg, while many cases are still unknown,Â€Â� he said. Causes of HIV/AIDS, he added, varied from sexual intercourse, to homosexuality, drug use, maternal infection and receiving infected blood. Increases in the number of HIV/AIDS cases were also due to a number of VCT (voluntary counselling and testing) facilities becoming available in Lombok and Sumbawa. Soeharmanto said that KPAP NTB and its partners continued to disseminate information on the need for high-risk groups to have checkups. Yet, the stigma related to the disease prevented them from visiting VCT facilities to have the free medical checkups. Separately, NTB Health AgencyÂ€Â™s Information and Documentation section head, M. Ismed Nuramadhani, acknowledged the spread of HIV/AIDS in NTB was alarming. He said the growing number of cases and the even spread of HIV/AIDS across the province was cause for grave concern. Â€ÂœThe spread of the disease has reached housewives and children. This is very alarming,Â€Â� he said. NTB, especially Lombok, which is a national tourist destination, he said, had a greater chance of HIV/AIDS spreading due to high mobility from various regions in Indonesia and overseas. Â€ÂœEarly detection is very important, not only for the health of the concerned person but also to prevent the spread of the disease.

"People living with HIV/AIDS fight addictions, return to work",A 37-year-old grave digger and ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver sat on a bench outside the Gambir community health center in Central Jakarta on Monday after he received methadone medication to help him deal with his addiction to heroin,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-07-06,The Jakarta Post,"A 37-year-old grave digger and ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver sat on a bench outside the Gambir community health center in Central Jakarta on Monday after he received methadone medication to help him deal with his addiction to heroin. He often shared syringes with other IDUs (intravenous drug users) because he did not have enough money to buy a new sterile one. Â€ÂœI started using heroin in 2001. I was influenced by my wife and her friends, who were IDUs,Â€Â� said the resident of Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta. Â€ÂœThen, my IDU friends started to die of illness one after another,Â€Â� he told The Jakarta Post. The death of his friends prompted him to take an HIV test at the health center in 2007. Â€ÂœMy test results showed that I was infected by HIV/AIDS. Soon after that, my wife took the test and it turned out that she too was also infected by the virus,Â€Â� he said. After he and his wife were diagnosed HIV+, doctors provided them with a regimen of treatment, including antiretrovirals (ARV) and methadone. Â€ÂœWe have to take ARV pills twice a day to prevent the virus from doing even more damage to our immune system,Â€Â� he said. The methadone, he said, had helped them to recover from their heroin addiction. Â€ÂœThe therapy has improved my physical health. Now I have enough strength to work and live a productive life, despite my illness,Â€Â� he said, adding that he earns Rp 100,000 (US$10.60) a day. He added that he and his wife were fortunate because they had not passed on the infection to their three children. Data from the National Commission on HIV/AIDS Prevention in 2012 showed that Jakarta was the province with the most incidences of HIV/AIDS, with over 5,000 people in the capital living with the condition. However, out of 44 community health centers in Jakarta, only 19 provide comprehensive treatment for HIV/AIDS including Gambir health center. The head of GambirÂ€Â™s HIV/AIDS unit, I Gede Subagya, said over 100 patients were being treated at the health center. Â€ÂœSince 2011, we have provided local residents with comprehensive HIV/AIDS treatment, which includes voluntary counseling and testing, ARV and methadone,Â€Â� he told the Post at his office.

The KPAP NTB data shows that cumulatively, from 2001 through July this year, as many as 152 housewives had been reportedly infected with HIV, 88 of whom had developed AIDS. In the same period, 31 children aged between 2 and 9 years old in the province had tested positive for HIV. Â€ÂœThe commissionÂ€Â™s findings show cases of HIV/AIDS transmitted to housewives and children have started to increase over the last five years. This is what we should anticipate because in NTB HIV/AIDS infections are not only in high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users,Â€Â� KPAP NTB secretariat head Soeharmanto told The Jakarta Post in Mataram on Wednesday. Citing official data, he said the number of housewives infected with HIV/AIDS was higher than HIV-infected commercial sex workers, which reached only 62, of whom 12 had developed AIDS. Overall, NTB recorded 912 HIV-infected people during the period 2001 to July this year, 504 of whom had developed AIDS. Of the total 504 AIDS-infected patients, 216 had died. Soeharmanto said the number of reported HIV/AIDS infections had continued to increase during the past five years as more voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) facilities were being provided in Lombok and Sumbawa since 2009.

Two more VCT facilities will become available in Bima and Sumbawa, but are yet to operate. Soeharmanto said KPAP NTB and its partner groups had continued to encourage people, especially those in high-risk groups, to have the courage to get an HIV checkup at a VCT center.

Local bylaws risk stigmatizing HIV patients,The HIV/AIDS Research Center of Atmajaya University has released a study arguing that HIV patients may be stigmatized by local ordinances requiring them to admit their health status to their partners,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-05-04,The Jakarta Post,"The HIV/AIDS Research Center of Atmajaya University has released a study arguing that HIV patients may be stigmatized by local ordinances requiring them to admit their health status to their partners. The bylaws stipulate that hiding HIV status from partners or spouses can be categorized as a crime, as such concealment is considered to put othersÂ€Â™ health at risk. The center said that such statutes exacerbated the stigma suffered by people living with HIV/AIDS. Â€ÂœNew HIV infections continue to be detected, meaning that HIV prevention [through the bylaws] has not been effective,Â€Â� center researcher Siradj Okta said on Thursday in a seminar held to discuss the study. The regulations, the center said, would also discourage people from taking HIV tests for fear that they would be forced to confess their status if they were diagnosed as HIV-positive. Â€ÂœAccording to criminal law theory, a person is unlikely to do something if it has legal consequences,Â€Â� Siradj told The Jakarta Post on the sidelines of the seminar. Siradj further warned that the bylaws could in fact lead to increased incidence of HIV infections, which they were intended to reduce. If people were discouraged from taking HIV tests, she argued, they would not realize if they were HIV-positive, increasing the likelihood of their transmitting the virus. Â€ÂœCriminalizing those who hide their HIV-positive status is meant to prevent transmission of the virus. However, the HIV virus can be transferred from [many sources]. It is not criminalization that prevents HIV transmission but awareness among infected people,Â€Â� she said, calling for the bylaws to be scrapped in favor of more HIV-awareness campaigns. Â€ÂœThe problem is that the majority of presumed HIV-positive people are not aware that they are HIV-positive [Â€Â¦] the HIV virus is mostly transmitted by people who are not aware of their HIV status,Â€Â� Siradj added. According to data the center gathered from the Health Ministry between 2012 and 2013, 80 percent of presumed HIV-positive people are unaware of their status. The study also showed that the bylaws might also worsen the stigma attached to HIV sufferers by criminalizing them for failing to confess their status. Â€ÂœHIV-positive people could be seen as criminals because of the statute. They are not criminals, they are victims,Â€Â� Sirajd said. He also said that the responsibility for HIV prevention must not rest solely with HIV sufferers. Â€ÂœPrecautionary measures are everyoneÂ€Â™s responsibility. I would recommend the bylaws be reviewed. ItÂ€Â™s better to continue with policies that have been proved to be effective,Â€Â� he said. Sirajd, however, admitted that his research was not ground-evidence-based as most research is. He conducted his research through secondary literature after failing to find a single instance of prosecution under the HIV statute. . He suggested future studies be conducted based on facts on the ground, although he said it would be difficult to find cases given the difficulty of upholding the bylaws. Simplexius Asa, a human rights and HIV activist, concurred with Sirajd, saying that there were currently dozens of similar bylaws in force in local administrations in 34 provinces in Indonesia. Since the first bylaw was issued in the early 2000s, Simplexius said, he had only found one case, in Papua, of the bylaws being upheld.. Â€ÂœIt is very hard to uphold the bylaws because besides the local administrationsÂ€Â™ lack of professional judges, some accusations in HIV cases are too complicated to be proven,Â€Â� Simplexius said, adding that he agreed that the bylaws should be reviewed.

The data, issued by the Health Ministry, revealed that there were 1,075 new cases of HIV infections in the capital as of March. West Java and East Java had the second and third highest number with 1,066 and 871 new HIV cases, respectively. The data also revealed that Jakarta was the city with the third-highest number of new AIDS cases after South Sulawesi and East Kalimantan. The capital recorded 56 cases, while South Sulawesi and East Kalimantan recorded 107 and 102 cases, respectively. Â€ÂœThe data shows that more residents in Jakarta are well-informed about this issue and therefore become more active in checking their HIV status,Â€Â� KPAP secretary Rohana Manggala said recently. Rohana further explained that the KPAP helped residents in Jakarta to check their HIV/AIDS status by providing free voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) facilities at every community health center (Puskesmas) in 33 districts throughout the capital. The KPAP held the cityÂ€Â™s third VCT event at St. Carolus Hospital in Salemba, Central Jakarta, last Thursday. The event was part of the VCT program launched in October ahead of World HIV/AIDS Day, which falls on Dec. 1. The event involved around 300 medical personnel and paramedics, as well as representatives from a number of non-governmental organizations. Rohana said that last ThursdayÂ€Â™s VCT and similar programs on offer at various Puskesmas were ready to test 20,000 Jakartans for HIV/AIDS this year. Based on Health Ministry data, by March of this year, 7,212 people nationwide were infected with HIV, while 595 others had contracted AIDS. Of those infected with HIV, 3,015 were women and 4,197 were men. In addition to the data, Rohana said that during the same period, 136 housewives had contracted AIDS, a number significantly higher than the seven sex workers recorded by the KPAP to have contracted AIDS. Â€ÂœMost of the housewives were infected because their husbands often had sex with different partners, including sex workers,Â€Â� said Rohana. She added that housewives were also more prone to HIV/AIDS because, feeling safe with their husbands, they tended to not use condoms. By contrast, most sex workers understood how to protect themselves from HIV/AIDS by using condoms.

Â€ÂœI was quite confused and shocked when I first read the report on Indonesia. I was wondering where they [UNAIDS researchers] obtained the data,Â€Â� said Mboi in a special interview with The Jakarta Post on the sidelines of the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, Australia. The UNAIDS report said that at the end of 2013, 4.8 million to 5.5 million people were living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. Six countries Â€Â” China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam Â€Â” account for more than 90 percent of people living with HIV in the region. According to the report, Indonesia has the third largest number of people living with HIV in the region, with AIDS related deaths increasing and only 8 percent of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Â€ÂœThe situation in Indonesia sparks a cause of concern, where new HIV infections increased by 48 percent and the countryÂ€Â™s share of new infections in the region reached 23 percent, second only to India,Â€Â� the report said. Nafsiah disagreed with the report, saying Indonesia had seen a significant rise in new HIV infections because the country had been intensifying a Â€Âœtest and treatÂ€Â� program to widely reach the countryÂ€Â™s key populations and to give them access to quality testing, treatment and a variety of services. Â€ÂœIndonesia has been strongly committed to achieving the MDG [Millennium Development Goal] to end AIDS as public health threat,Â€Â� she noted. In 2012, there were 800,000 people tested and only 26,000 people were HIV positive. Â€ÂœThis was good for a large country like Indonesia,Â€Â� she said. In 2013, there were more than 1 million people tested. The minister also argued that the report did not portray the reality on the ground. Â€ÂœThey have to check with us, which figures they were using and what denominators they used for the report.Â€Â� Responding, Michel SidibÃƒÂ©, the UNAIDS executive director, told the Post that Indonesia had been implementing good, innovative programs in scaling up the testing and treatment of people at risk of, or living with HIV, during the last two years. Â€ÂœThe country has optimized all resources Â€Â” in the fields of policy making, funding, investment and human resources, to give opportunities to people living with HIV there to get health access, which resulted in the identification of a number of new HIV infections,Â€Â� SidibÃƒÂ© explained.

Candidate AIDS vaccine passes key early test,The near 40-year quest for an AIDS vaccine received a hopeful boost Saturday when scientists announced that a trial drug triggered an immune response in humans and shielded monkeys from infection.,['The Jakarta Post'],2018-07-07,The Jakarta Post,"The near 40-year quest for an AIDS vaccine received a hopeful boost Saturday when scientists announced that a trial drug triggered an immune response in humans and shielded monkeys from infection. Shown to be safe in humans, the candidate vaccine has now advanced to the next phase of the pre-approval trial process, and will be tested in 2,600 women in southern Africa to see whether it prevents HIV infection. While the results so far have been encouraging, the research team and outside experts warn there are no guarantees it will actually work in the next trial phase dubbed HVTN705 or ""Imbokodo"" -- the isiZulu word for ""rock"". ""Although these data are promising, we need to remain cautious,"" study leader Dan Barouch, a Harvard Medical School professor, told AFP. Just because it protected two-thirds of monkeys in a lab trial doesnt mean the drug will protect humans, ""and thus we need to await the results of the... study before we know whether or not this vaccine will protect humans against HIV infection,"" he said. The results of the Imbokodo trial are expected in 2021/22. ""This is only the fifth HIV vaccine concept that will be tested for efficacy in humans in the 35+ year history of the global HIV epidemic,"" added Barouch. Only one so far, RV144, yielded some protection. RV144 was reported in 2009 to reduce the risk of HIV infection among 16,000 Thai volunteers by 31.2 percent -- deemed insufficient for the drug to be pursued. For the latest study, published in The Lancet medical journal, Barouch and a team tested the candidate drug on 393 healthy, HIV-free adults aged 18 to 50 in east Africa, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States. The participants were randomly given one of seven vaccine combinations or a placebo ""dummy"" alternative. They received four shots each over 48 weeks. Needed badly The study used so-called ""mosaic"" vaccine combinations. These combine pieces of different HIV virus types to elicit an immune response -- when the body attacks intruder germs -- against virus strains from different regions of the world. The vaccine ""induced robust (high levels of) immune responses in humans,"" said Barouch. The tests also showed the vaccine was safe. Five participants reported side-effects such as stomach pain and diarrhoea, dizziness, or back pain. In a separate study, the same vaccine offered complete protection from infection in two-thirds of 72 trial monkeys each given six injections with an HIV-like virus. ""I cannot emphasise how badly we need to have a vaccine... to get rid of HIV in the next generation altogether,"" said Francois Venter of the University of the Witwatersrand Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in South Africa. Approached for comment on the study, which he was not involved in, Venter urged caution. ""We have been here before, with promising candidate vaccines that havent panned out,"" he told AFP. ""This one is novel in many ways so it is exciting, but we have a long way to go."" Could be phenomenal Jean-Daniel Lelievre of Frances Vaccine Research Institute said the vaccine was likely not the ""definitive"" version, but may represent ""a phenomenal advance."" An estimated 37 million people live with HIV/AIDS, according to the World Health Organization. There are about 1.8 million new infections and a million deaths every year. Almost 80 million people are estimated to have been infected since the virus was first diagnosed in the early 1980s. About 35 million have died. A vaccine has proven elusive as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mutates easily and can hide away in cells, evading the immune system, only to reemerge and spread years later. For now, people infected with HIV rely on lifelong virus-suppressing anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to stay healthy. Condoms are still at the frontline of efforts to prevent infection -- mainly through sex and blood contact -- though more and more people use ART as prophylaxis.

Thailand to eliminate mother-child HIV spread,"Thailand has become the first country in Asia to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-06-08,The Jakarta Post,"Thailand has become the first country in Asia to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday. The milestone is another step in Thailands aggressive campaign to reduce new cases of the AIDS virus, but experts warn many other problems still exist â€” including a rising rate of new HIV infections among gay men and transgender people. The number of babies contracting HIV dropped from more than 3,000 in the late 1990s to 86 in 2015, a figure that was validated to meet WHOs criteria for elimination â€” mother-to-child transmission rates of less than 2 percent and fewer than 50 new infections in 100,000 births. Cuba became the first country to reach the goal last year. Along with Thailand, Belarus eliminated the mother-to-child spread of HIV and syphilis, Armenia did for HIV and Moldova did for syphilis, the WHO announced Tuesday. Globally, 220,000 new cases of HIV were recorded in babies in 2014, and syphilis caused some 200,000 stillbirths and neonatal deaths in 2012. ""I do think that once Thailand has been able to do it, its a motivation for other countries around the world and also for the public health community because one does see now that, yes, the world can be free of HIV,"" Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHOs Southeast Asia director, said by phone, noting Thailands HIV rate was once among the regions highest. Thailands success comes from strong prenatal care from large cities all the way to the poorest villages. Nearly all pregnant Thai women are screened for HIV, 95 percent of those who test positive are treated to prevent transmission to their babies and almost 100 percent of babies born to HIV-positive mothers are given antiretroviral drugs. However, hundreds of thousands of migrant women, many of them working or seeking menial jobs in Thailand, are not included in the data. Many poor women from neighboring Myanmar and Cambodia do not receive any prenatal care or HIV screening while in Thailand. A 2010 Thai government report found that two to three times more migrant women were infected with HIV in certain areas of the country. There are an estimated 2.7 million registered and undocumented male and female migrant workers in Thailand. They have limited access to the countrys health care system, and many are reluctant to get tested or treated for HIV due to language barriers or out of fear they will lose their jobs or have negative interactions with police or other authority figures, according to UNAIDS. Steve Mills, technical director at nonprofit FHI360s Asia-Pacific office in Bangkok, said this is an area Thailand needs to improve, along with focusing more on at-risk populations such as intravenous drug users and sex workers operating outside of brothels. Gay men and transgender people are of particular concern. ""With the evolution of the epidemic and people being on HIV treatment, its meant that condom use is harder to get to a satisfactory level,"" he said, adding that gay men and transgender people are often harder to reach today because couples often meet through social networks instead of in bars, saunas or other public places where outreach workers once targeted them. ""We need to encourage people to get tested."" Last year, the World Bank published a study calling for more free anonymous testing and treatment among gay men. It said the rate of infection within Bangkok alone had jumped from an estimated 21 percent in 2000 to 28 percent in 2012. Only one-fifth of those infected were receiving antiretroviral drugs, even though its provided by the government without cost. Thailand was hailed by the international community as a model for other countries after promoting 100 percent condom use among sex workers in brothels in the 1990s, drastically reducing infection rates. But AIDS continues to kill. In 2014, an estimated 20,000 people died from the disease in Thailand, a rate that has remained steady for the past five years. An estimated 450,000 people are living with the virus in the country of 60 million.",{},"['spread', 'workers', 'rate', 'gay', 'hiv', 'men', 'estimated', 'women', 'world', 'thailand', 'eliminate', 'motherchild', 'syphilis']","Thailand has become the first country in Asia to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, the World Health Organization announced Tuesday.

A fast-track to end the AIDS epidemic,"Home to the third-largest number of people living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia is a country critical to ending the AIDS epidemic in the region and on this World AIDS Day we are at a defining moment",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"Home to the third-largest number of people living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia is a country critical to ending the AIDS epidemic in the region and on this World AIDS Day we are at a defining moment. Only three decades since HIV arrived in this country, we can begin to close the chapter on one of modern historyÂ€Â™s worst epidemics. In September, Indonesia was one of 193 United Nations member states to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals and commit to ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030. This goal is certainly ambitious but it is achievable. Even without a vaccine or a cure, we know how to stop HIV. Indonesia can pride itself on being a pathfinder in the AIDS epidemic on the global stage. In 2013 the Indonesian government launched the Strategic Use of AIDS (SUFA) policy Â€Â” a pioneering strategy that made antiretroviral treatment available immediately for any person diagnozed with HIV. Providing early treatment has the double advantage of keeping people living with HIV healthy and stopping further transmission of the virus. Last month, the World Health Organization endorsed a similar policy for all countries. The program has now been rolled out in 75 districts. The number of ART sites has more than doubled since 2008 and more than 50 000 people were accessing HIV treatment in 2014, compared with less than 2 500 in 2005. The program is a good indication of how the Indonesian government has sought new and innovative approaches in responding to HIV, and is one of the first in Asia to use treatment as prevention in reducing HIV transmission. At the end of 2014, just a year and a half after the SUFA program was launched, HIV testing has reached slightly more than 1 million people, which is more than five times the number tested in 2010. There has been a massive expansion of prevention services, including condom distribution in key locations and harm reduction programs for people who inject drugs. This scaling up of prevention and treatment services has been possible because of IndonesiaÂ€Â™s investment in its AIDS response and the commitment made to fund HIV treatment for its citizens, which has reached more than US$60 million in 2014. The partnership with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other international partners has also provided very critical support during the early stages of the epidemic. Thanks to the rapid expansion of prevention and treatment programs between 2004 and 2014 nearly half a million new HIV infections have been averted, saving Indonesia billions in treatment costs and avoiding the devastating social, economic and personal impact of the disease on many families and communities. While the country has implemented a pioneering policy on HIV treatment for everyone living with HIV, its treatment coverage is far lower than the global average. If Indonesia is to meet its commitment to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, it needs to urgently intensify and scale-up its HIV response. It is one of 35 countries that UNAIDS has identified as a priority country which must adopt a Fast-Track approach, by front-loading investments and initiating efficient and innovative approaches over the next five years in order to reach critical HIV prevention and treatment targets. Jakarta is at the heart of IndonesiaÂ€Â™s AIDS epidemic, and although it has only 6 percent of the countryÂ€Â™s population, Jakarta accounts for almost 17 percent of the total number of people living with HIV living in Indonesia. A month ago the Governor of Jakarta, Basuki Â€ÂœAhokÂ€Â� Tjahaja Purnama took the bold step of committing to the UNAIDS fast-track approach by signing the Paris Declaration, which has garnered support from city leaders around the globe. He has also formally instructed the mayors of the five Jakarta municipalities to develop their work plans and budgets in line with the fast-track targets. Jakarta has taken many key measures to promote HIV testing, devoting a month a year to encouraging companies to conduct tests. All city residents can access free HIV testing. Jakarta province is developing a roadmap that will ensure that all its six municipalities allocate resources in a coordinated fashion, setting ambitious targets for testing and treatment, and clear milestones to monitor progress. Time and time again, we have seen that investing in the AIDS response brings huge rewards. Implementing the fast-track strategy in Jakarta and throughout the country carries a big price-tag Â€Â” more than $500 million over the next five years. At the moment the country shoulders 57 percent of its AIDS budget but as the economy grows, international donors will increasingly withdraw. Indonesia must set out a clear strategy for transitioning to a largely domestically funded response. Provinces and districts will need to assume a greater share of the cost of local responses, and will need to come up with clear plans for mobilizing resources and to already start developing their transition plans, just as Jakarta has begun to do. Of critical importance will be ensuring that the new national health insurance (JKN) covers the cost of the bulk of HIV-related services. There is also scope for making service delivery more cost-effective, both through better integration of HIV services in the health sector and by strengthening coordination between health facilities and community-based organizations (CBOs) on HIV testing, care and support. While funding is a concern, I am even more concerned by the frequent calls by certain religious and public figures to close down brothel complexes in the country. Such action can only undermine existing programs in brothel settings, which we know have been effective in promoting condom use and reducing transmission of HIV. Closing brothels will not stop sex work and will instead create a situation where HIV will find a favorable environment to spread among sex workers and their clients. As we commemorate World AIDS Day, we have a precious window of opportunity to make a difference and build on the foundations which have been put in place during the past 10 years. We have the opportunity to set more ambitious targets for treatment and prevention and invest more domestic resources on the AIDS response just as the Jakarta governor has committed to do. By investing in the AIDS response the government will prevent HIV from impacting hundreds of thousands of lives and ensuring that those already living with HIV can lead healthy, productive lives. These benefits impact not only the individuals concerned but promise a better future for their families and communities as well. _____________________________ The writer is the UN secretary-generalÂ€Â™s special envoy for AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.

230 Papuans circumcised to curb HIV/AIDS,"The Papua AIDS Eradication Commission (KPAD) has overseen the circumcision of 230 Papuans using PrePex devices, a painless procedure provided by the US-based Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), at Dok II Jayapura Hospital",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-07-07,The Jakarta Post,"The Papua AIDS Eradication Commission (KPAD) has overseen the circumcision of 230 Papuans using PrePex devices, a painless procedure provided by the US-based Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), at Dok II Jayapura Hospital. Â€ÂœOf the 253 people who applied for circumcision, 230 had it done. Of the rest, 20 could not proceed because of previously existing penile inserts while the other three had their rings released early due to discomfort,Â€Â� Papua KPAD secretary Constant Karma said in Jayapura on Monday. Karma, who was also among those having the circumcision done, said that the circumcisions were expected to help control the spread of HIV/AIDS. Circumcision, he said, prevented men from contracting many venereal diseases, which were considered a stepping stone in the spread of HIV/AIDS. Â€ÂœBy lowering the amount of venereal disease, it is expected that the spread of HIV/AIDS will also be slowed,Â€Â� Karma said. He added that the skin on the tip of the penis was where different germs causing venereal diseases might be nesting. Earlier, Karma, a former deputy governor of Papua, revealed that the total number of people infected with AIDS in the province had reached around 19,000 since the virus was first detected in Merauke in 1992. The device, consisting of an elastic ring that gets placed on a maleÂ€Â™s genitals for seven days, has been considered practical and easy to use and can provide a non-surgical, medical means to carry out adult male circumcisions. The modern devices were brought into Papua and West Papua by CHAI and were first used in Indonesia and a number of African countries. The PrePex method is used for men of 15 years of age and older. Before being circumcised, the patients underwent counseling to avoid shock after having the rings attached to their genitals. Charles, one of the participants, said that he could still carry out daily functions after having the rings installed. Although, he said, he felt pain each morning. Â€ÂœThe pain came when my penis was erect but it disappeared with the erection also,Â€Â� said Charles, adding that during erection the rings exerted more pressure, thus causing pain. Charles also said that two days after the rings were attached, the skin on the tip of his penis began to blacken and on the third day it became septic and odorous. On the seventh day, he said, the skin had dried and was then cut off and the rings were released. Meanwhile, HIV/AIDS counselor Siti Soltief of the Dok II Jayapura Hospital said that after the rings were released, the men were not allowed to have sex within the following six weeks, to allow the cut skin to heal completely. Â€ÂœAll the circumcision participants have been informed of this and they have all understood and agreed to abide by it,Â€Â� Siti said. After Papua, voluntary circumcision using the PrePex device will also be conducted in Wamena, Jayawijaya, Paniai and Manokwari, in West Papua.

Gorontalo-chapter National AIDS Commission (KPA) secretary Irwansyah said that of a number of private and public hospitals in regencies and municipalities across the province, only Aloei Saboe Regional General Hospital (RSUD) in Gorontalo City provided the ARV therapy. Â€ÂœThe HIV/AIDS patients are spread across five regencies and one municipality in Gorontalo, and some of them are living in remote areas, such as Pohuwato regency on the border of Gorontalo and Central Sulawesi, which is quite far from Gorontalo City.

He was speaking on the sidelines of an event to celebrate the World AIDS Day at Likada Square in Kabila, Bone Bolango regency, on Monday. Irwansyah said it was only the HIV/AIDS patients that could access the ARV medication at RSUD Aloei Sabe, with close assistance from specially-assigned doctors. He said KPA Gorontalo was trying very hard to make ARV treatments for ODHA available in every hospital.

HIV kids repelled from their new home in Surakarta,Illustration,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-08,The Jakarta Post,"A week after the world commemorated Â€Â˜World AIDS dayÂ€Â™ on Dec 1, nine children living with HIV have been rejected from their new house in Surakarta, the home-town of President Joko Â€Â˜JokowiÂ€Â™ Widodo, in central Java. The children were physically unable to enter, nor bring their packing truck to the newly-rented house as the road had been blockaded before they arrived on Monday. Some residents displayed posters illustrating the rejection, proclaiming such statements as; Â€ÂœProtect the kids in neighborhood unit (RT) 4Â€Â�, Â€ÂœKedunglumbu ainÂ€Â™t a HIV kampongÂ€Â� and Â€ÂœGood men donÂ€Â™t make their neighbors worryÂ€Â�. Â€ÂœWe didnÂ€Â™t expect that resident antipathy against HIV-sufferers would be this harsh. I canÂ€Â™t see the reason behind it because HIV/AIDS awareness programs have been run on a massive scale,Â€Â� explained Yunus Prasetyo, Rumah Singgah Lentera founder, on Tuesday, Dec. 8. The nine children, aged from one to 13 years, initially stayed at a house rented by Lentera in Bumi village, Laweyan district, Surakarta. However, they had to move out as the leasing period had ended and the lessor rejected to extend the lease term due to pressure from local residents. Lentara had managed to lease a new house in Kedunglumbu village, Pasar Kliwon district, Surakarta. However, upon their arrival at the new location, the children and their moving truck were stopped at a barricade that had been made by local residents. Head of neighborhood unit 4 Kedunglumbu, Awud Basbul, admitted that most of the residents rejected the HIV children and neighborhood officials ultimately defended this stance after a vote showed a unanimous result. Â€ÂœThree, of 23 residents who joined the meeting agreed to let the children move into the neighborhood while 20 others had rejected their inclusion,Â€Â� he explained. Surakarta acting mayor Budi Suharto acknowledged that the government has missed the opportunity to prevent the expulsion of the HIV children. According to him, the AIDS prevention commission (KPA) had failed in their attempts to illuminate the society with regard to correct HIV/AIDS understanding. Â€ÂœIf they had succeeded, there would not be such rejections. KPA has been narrowly dealing with medical checks and AIDS prevention, but has yet to handle matters concerning those living with HIV [in society]. We will summon KPA for further explanation. We will not let the children be abandoned,Â€Â� he said. As a temporary solution, he continued, Surakarta municipality would accommodate the children in the Pondok Boro social home, owned and run by the municipality. He called on the public not to discriminate or reject HIV sufferers. Lentera, a non-government organization, provides a social home for children suffering with HIV, to provide them with assistance, counseling, free medical checks and HIV/AIDS awareness programs explained Yunus, further. Discriminate action against these unfortunate children sets a bad precedent for Surakarta, a city which had previously ran campaigns under the guise of being Kota Layak Anak (child friendly city), said Yunus.

Urgent treatment required for Klaten infants infected with HIV,"Nineteen children under the age of 5 years old have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Klaten, Central Java, and now require urgent treatment.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-02-23,The Jakarta Post,"Nineteen children under the age of 5 years old have been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in Klaten, Central Java, and now require urgent treatment. In the last case, detected in January, a 2-year-old boy was reported to have shown symptoms of HIV since he was 18 months old. â€œThe only possible way a child under 5 can be transmitted the virus is if the mother is HIV-positive during pregnancy and childbirth. Unfortunately, it often happens that antibody screening tests conducted on parents are unable to detect HIV infection,â€� said Amin Bagus Panuntun, an activist from the National AIDS Commission (KPA) Klaten, on Tuesday. Based on KPA Klaten data, during the period of 2007-2015, 18 children under 5 were indicated to have the HIV virus in their blood. Of them, seven children tested positive for HIV in the middle of 2015. Amin said mother-to-child transmission of HIV could be prevented if it was ascertained early on whether the parents had contracted HIV/AIDS. The problem, he said, was the widespread reluctance to undergo voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for various reasons. As a result, many babies were infected with HIV because their mothers were unaware that they themselves had contracted the virus. â€œTherefore, starting this year, we will direct all pregnant women in Klaten to take VCT to prevent the transmission of the virus from HIV-infected mothers to children,â€� said Amin. Meanwhile, he went on, all babies who had tested positive for HIV/AIDS would get treatment from the Klaten Health Agency via hospitals it had appointed to provide antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to slow down the copying of the virus in the body. â€œCurrently, we handle all HIV/AIDS-infected babies. They will receive a continuous supply of ARV drugs,â€� Klaten Health Agency head Cahyono Widodo said on Tuesday. Over the course of the last nine years, the number of HIV/AIDS cases in Klaten has continued to increase from year to year. Based on KPA Klaten data, 105 people were found to have contracted HIV/AIDS in 2015. They could not, however, be said to be new patients; they were merely recorded as patients last year when they started VCT. In total, the number of HIV/AIDS-infected people in Klaten reached 380 between 2007 to January this year. Of the total, 273 patients are heterosexuals, followed by high-risk people ( 47 ), men who have sex with men ( 26 ), children under 5 ( 19 ), injecting drug users (9), transsexuals (3) and bisexuals (3).

High risk of 'losing control' of AIDS epidemic: Experts,"The AIDS epidemic risks resurging and spiraling out of control unless billions of extra dollars are pumped into prevention and treatment, experts warned Sunday on the eve of a major world conference.",['The Jakarta Post'],2018-07-23,The Jakarta Post,"The AIDS epidemic risks resurging and spiraling out of control unless billions of extra dollars are pumped into prevention and treatment, experts warned Sunday on the eve of a major world conference. An alarming rate of new infections, coupled with an exploding population of young people in hard-hit countries, meant the world could be steering for ""a crisis of epic proportions,"" said Mark Dybul, an American AIDS researcher and diplomat. ""Bad things will happen if we dont have more money,"" he told a special event organised a day before some 15,000 delegates attend the opening of the International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. The world was ""probably at the highest risk ever of losing control of this epidemic because of demographics and because of countries not paying attention the way they once did, or never did in some cases,"" warned Dybul. UNAIDS last week reported a record number of HIV-positive people using life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ARV), and lower rates of deaths and new infections -- though not low enough according to campaigners. And even this progress risks being overturned. Speakers warned that donor and domestic funding has dropped significantly, and would likely continue declining. Under Donald Trump, the US administration has proposed massive spending cuts, though these have failed to pass through Congress so far. The US is by far the biggest funder of the global AIDS response. Read also: Debunking myths about HIV/AIDS Condoms work! According to UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe, there was a funding gap of almost $7 billion (about six billion euros). ""If we dont pay now we will pay more and more later,"" he told the meeting. Experts lamented that the successful rollout of life-saving, virus-suppressing drugs may have diverted necessary attention, and cash, away from the need to curb new HIV infections. ARVs are also increasing being used, mainly in rich countries, to prevent contracting the virus from sex. To meet the UN goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, infections must be limited to 500,000 per year globally in just two years time. Last years 1.8 million new infections showed that ""unless we did something completely drastic, we will not get anywhere near"" the goal, said Nduku Kilonzo of Kenyas National AIDS Control Council. ""Condoms work!"" she underlined, but only when they are available. Investment in condom distribution has dropped, and less than half the need was being covered, she said. ""We are far, far, far away from our goal of prevention, not just elimination,"" Kilonzo warned. ""We have a crisis and it is a prevention crisis."" David Barr, a senior treatment advocate who is himself HIV positive, agreed that access to drugs, without prevention, ""will not end AIDS"". ""When I last spoke in this conference centre in 1992, I could never have imagined that I would be standing here 26 years later alive and well,"" he told delegates. ""I could never have imagined that 21 million people around the world would be on very effective HIV treatment, I could never have imagined that we will have such effective tools to prevent HIV transmission."" Yet, the success is ""incredibly fragile"", warned Barr. ""We can lose our opportunities and the tools we have created if we fail to use them effectively. If we lose them, then were back to the horror of 1992"" when infections and deaths were skyrocketing.",{},"['far', 'epidemic', 'risk', 'prevention', 'hiv', 'treatment', 'control', 'warned', 'infections', 'world', 'high', 'losing', 'told', 'imagined', 'aids', 'experts']","The AIDS epidemic risks resurging and spiraling out of control unless billions of extra dollars are pumped into prevention and treatment, experts warned Sunday on the eve of a major world conference.

South Tangerang HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation commission manager Muhammad Rusmin said on Saturday that of the 77 new HIV/AIDS cases, 39 were in Ciputat district, with a significance increase of prevalence in the 20-45 age group. Â€ÂœThe spread of HIV in the municipality has reached a worrying level because the majority of those living with HIV/AIDS are in their most productive years,Â€Â� Rusmin told reporters in North Serpong district, adding that these figures are just the tip of an iceberg because not everyone was willing to be tested. Â€ÂœThe actual figures are believed to be even more bleak.Â€Â� The commission blamed the spread of the virus on unsafe sex, citing a red-light district in Tegal Rotan and the numerous massage parlors that offered sex as one of their services, all in Ciputat. The commission has recorded an annual increase in the number of sex workers in the municipality of between 300 and 450 in recent years. To curb the spread of the virus, the agency regularly sweeps red-light districts, nets sex workers for a blood test, provides educational programs about sexually transmitted diseases for residents and identifies the areas that are highly prone to the transmission of HIV.

Jakarta launches 'Â€Â˜fast track'Â€Â™ strategy to combat HIV/AIDS,"The Jakarta administration launched over the weekend a strategy to combat and eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2020, called the Jakarta Fast Track Ending the AIDS Epidemic",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The Jakarta administration launched over the weekend a strategy to combat and eradicate HIV/AIDS by 2020, called the Jakarta Fast Track Ending the AIDS Epidemic. The strategy is part of the worldwide target to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. The head of the health control unit of the Jakarta Health Agency, Widyastuti, said that part of the strategy was to make HIV treatment closer and more accessible to residents through community health centers (Puskesmas). Â€ÂœCurrently, there are a number of selected Puskesmas that can treat HIV patients with ARV [antiretroviral therapy]. The idea is to bring facilities closer to residents,Â€Â� Widyastuti told reporters during the launch of the campaign at Taman Suropati in Central Jakarta over the weekend. Eleven Puskesmas are able to independently treat HIV patients with ARV, a lifelong treatment that reduces the amount of HIV in oneÂ€Â™s body and helps boost the immune system. While only 11 independent Puskesmas provide ARV treatment, Widyastuti said that all of the cityÂ€Â™s Puskesmas provide counseling for residents regarding HIV/AIDS. She said the city administration also had 17 other Puskesmas that serve as satellite clinics to general hospitals that provide ARV treatments with referrals from the hospitals. Â€ÂœFurthermore, all of our Puskesmas provide counseling for residents who want to ask anything about HIV or AIDS. Residents can also check their HIV status at the 44 district Puskesmas in addition to the available hospitals,Â€Â� she said. The secretary of the Jakarta chapter of the AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA), Rohana Manggala, said that commemorating World HIV/AIDS Day on Dec. 1 was not just a mere ceremonial event, but meant to increase residentsÂ€Â™ awareness and knowledge of the illness. She added that it was highly important for Jakartans to understand HIV and AIDS, as Jakarta has thus far recorded the highest number of new cases of HIV this year. Data issued by the Health Ministry revealed that there were 1,075 new cases of HIV infections in the capital as of March. West Java and East Java had the second and third highest number with 1,066 and 871 new HIV cases, respectively. During the commemoration of World HIV/AIDS Day, the city administration will encourage residents to check their HIV status and starting on Sunday provided 10 booths where they can check their status for free for three days. Hundreds of residents have lined up to get their blood taken. One visitor, 28-year-old Evan Maulana, said that he drove early in the morning from Kebayoran, South Jakarta, just to take the test. Evan, an ex-drug user, said that he felt obliged to check his HIV status because of his old habits. He said that although he now had a Â€Âœmuch cleanerÂ€Â� lifestyle compared with his younger days, there was still a possibility he had caught the virus while doing drugs. Â€ÂœI understand how important it is to check my HIV status, especially for someone who used to be involved in drugs like myself,Â€Â� Evan said. _____________________________________ Hospitals providing ARV Central Jakarta: Tarakan General Hospital, RSCM, St. Carolus, Mintoharjo Navy Hospital, Gatot Subroto Army Hospital, Husada Hospital, Kramat 128 Hospital, Islam Cempaka Putih Hospital.

"Rights group, worried about HIV, urges Philippines action","A human rights watchdog says the Philippines is facing one of the fastest growing epidemics of HIV in the Asia Pacific, fueled by government policies that restrict intervention, including access to condom by men who have sex with men.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-12-08,The Jakarta Post,"A human rights watchdog says the Philippines is facing one of the fastest growing epidemics of HIV in the Asia Pacific, fueled by government policies that restrict intervention, including access to condom by men who have sex with men. Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men has increased tenfold in the last five years, but the government has failed to adequately target prevention measures on that population. It said HIV prevention education in Philippine schools is woefully inadequate, commercial marketing of condoms is nonexistent, and barriers to condom access and HIV testing â€” particularly those below 18 who are required by law to have parental consentâ€” have contributed to the worsening epidemic. The report said the problems found in national and local government policies are compounded by longstanding resistance of the Roman Catholic church to contraceptives. More than 80 percent of Filipinos are Catholic. Peter Mosende, a country officer of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS or UNAIDS, said the Philippines has the highest rate of new HIV infections in the Asia-Pacific region, with new cases increasing by more than 100 percent from 2001 to 2015. The Department of Health said it recorded 38,114 cases of HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, from January 1984 to October 2016 â€” less than 1 percent of a population of more than 100 million. But the rate of increase has been alarming, with 32,099 of the cases recorded from 2011 to 2016. Officials estimate there could 55,000 cases by the end of 2016. For the first 10 months of this year, 7,756 new HIV cases were recorded. From one new case a day in 2008, today 26 new infections are recorded daily. Beginning in 2010, the transmission trend shifted from male-female sex to male-to-male sex, which this year accounts for 87 percent of new infections, the health department said. More than half of those infected men are 25 to 34 years old, and nearly 30 percent are aged 15 to 24. ""The government had a pretty good track record of fighting HIV-AIDS, but basically they are fighting the last war,"" Phelim Kine, HRW deputy director for asia, said in an interview. ""They are still focusing on female sex workers and their clients when actually the epidemic has changed, but the governments approach is not changing and it needs to or else this will really get out of control."" He said while President Rodrigo Duterte has earned criticism for his bloody war on drugs, government action on the HIV problem is ""something we can reasonably hope for"" given Dutertes expressed support for public health and rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial last week said her department plans to distribute condoms in schools after coordination with the education department and school authorities. She said her office is considering making HIV self-testing kits available to the public. Carlos Conde, HRWs Philippines researcher, welcomed Ubials announcement, but said the government needs to overcome expected opposition from the church, Catholic schools, and parents. The report is based on field research between February and October, and interviews with 82 people across eight cities, including two where officials have prohibited the sale or distribution of condoms and other contraceptives. The research found that young gay men have been subjected to ridicule when they buy condoms from drug stores and have faced stigma when they go to social hygiene clinics that provide free condoms to sex workers. The report recommended abolishing legal restrictions that bar youth under 18 years of age from buying condoms or getting HIV tests without parental consent, better sex education in schools, and imposing penalties on municipalities that refuse to comply with the laws that guarantee the public distribution of contraceptives, including condoms.

Poor awareness hampers AIDS control in West Java,"While facing more frequent exposure to HIV infection, few key populations in West Java get tested for HIV, hampering efforts to tackle the spread of the chronic illness in the province.",['The Jakarta Post'],2017-04-06,The Jakarta Post,"While facing more frequent exposure to HIV infection, few key populations in West Java get tested for HIV, hampering efforts to tackle the spread of the chronic illness in the province. Certain groups, such as men who have sex with men, that engage in risky sexual behavior that increases exposure to HIV, make a significant contribution to new cases of the infection in West Java, an official has said. â€œOnly around 13 percent of men who have sex with men have been tested for HIV. The problem is, around 60 percent of them are married so that their wives and children face the potential consequences of becoming infected with the virus,â€� said West Java chapter National AIDS Commission (KPA) secretary Iman Tejarahmana after a meeting with West Java Deputy Governor Deddy Mizwar in Bandung on Tuesday. With such a phenomenon, Iman said, public awareness to carry out HIV testing had become important. The result of the tests could give the overall picture that all stakeholders, including the government, needed to implement precise HIV/AIDS prevention and control programs, he went on. It is estimated that the number of people at risk of HIV in West Java reaches 1.3 million. Men who have sex with men are among the key populations, which include female commercial sex workers, clients of female sex workers, transgender people, transgender sex worker clients and injecting drug users. (Read also: Most new HIV infections recorded in Jakarta) The Health Ministry says risky sexual behavior, which also occurs in heterosexual relationships, was the highest factor in the transmission of HIV/AIDS in Indonesia at the end of 2016, potentially accounting for 66 percent of cases. From the time it was first detected in 1987 to the second quarter of 2016, there have been 208,920 cases of HIV and 82,556 cases of AIDS in Indonesia, spread over 407 regencies and municipalities across the country. Based on KPA West Java data, the number of HIV cases recorded in the province from 1989 to December 2016 reached 26,422, while AIDS cases amounted to 8,043. According to the data, as of December 2016, West Java ranks fourth out of provinces with the highest number of HIV positive cases after Jakarta, East Java and Papua. Meanwhile of AIDS cases, West Java ranked sixth after East Java, Papua, Jakarta, Bali and Central Java. To increase peopleâ€™s awareness about HIV testing, the West Java administration is working with AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), an international organization, which supports HIV/ AIDS prevention and control programs in Indonesia. AHF senior vice president Peter Reis said his organization was committed to helping the program via a three-year partnership with the Health Ministry. AHF has allocated Rp 31 billion (US$2.33 million) for HIV/ AIDS programs in four areas, which comprise Jakarta and three regencies in West Java, namely Indramayu, Pangandaran and Purwakarta. Most of the funds are allocated for HIV testing and treatment. Reis hopes the partnership will increase peopleâ€™s access to HIV/AIDS-related health care services, boost awareness on the importance of early HIV testing and provide quality but affordable HIV medical treatment for all people. â€œWe will link with them programmatically on service delivery for health care,â€� he said.",{},"['java', 'cases', 'poor', 'hiv', 'sex', 'control', 'men', 'awareness', 'health', 'west', 'hampers', '2016', 'testing', 'aids']","With such a phenomenon, Iman said, public awareness to carry out HIV testing had become important.

""Knowing your HIV status is critical and the launch of this product will empower people to discreetly test themselves when it is convenient to them and in a place where they feel comfortable,"" explained BioSure founder Brigette Bard. Early diagnosis reduces the risk of passing the disease on to other people and also raises the success rate of modern treatments, which now make the disease manageable. ""Over 40 percent of people living with HIV are diagnosed late, meaning they have been living with HIV for at least four years,"" said Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust (NAT). ""People diagnosed late are 11 times more likely to die in the first year after diagnosis,"" she added. The kit reacts to antibodies -- proteins made in response to the virus -- in a drop of the persons blood, producing two purple lines in the event of a positive diagnosis. The self-test, which is only available via the Internet, can only detect antibodies three months after the patient has become infected, and is not effective during this initial period, and all positive results must be confirmed by professional health workers, experts said. Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive at HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said it was ""great to see the first self-test kits being approved. ""However, it is important to make sure people can get quick access to support when they get their result."" Currently, those who fear they may have been infected have to collect a blood sample at home and send it to a laboratory, waiting five days for the result. There are almost 110,000 people in Britain living with HIV, which can lead to AIDS if the sufferers immune system becomes badly damaged.

Â€ÂœWe also call on people not to stigmatize and discriminate against them,Â€Â� Ari said. Semarang City AIDS Commission (KPA) secretary Bambang Soekardjo said that to help improve peopleÂ€Â™s awareness, the city administration had established so-called AIDS Caring People groups in 47 subdistricts. The administration had also disseminated information regarding symptoms to officials in local offices of the Religious Affairs Ministry, to be passed on to future brides and grooms. As of September this year, Central Java noted 3,767 cases of AIDS and 9,032 cases of HIV, in which 10 percent of AIDS cases were found in teenagers. Nationally, according to data from the Health Ministry, as of September this year, 67 percent of HIV/AIDS transmissions were via heterosexual relationships. In Gorontalo, World AIDS Day was marked with activities ranging from campaigns, the distribution of brochures on the disease and blood donor sessions involving civil servants on Monday.

Without the drugs, one develops the disease AIDS, and due to a lowered immune system are susceptible to many infections. Without drugs patients die within one year. If readers believe the statement made in the article, they will be complacent and delay getting tested.

Sexually transmitted HIV on the rise in Depok,"The Depok HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA Depok) has revealed an increase in the sexual transmission of HIV, surpassing the use of contaminated syringes as the most common route of transmission in the municipality",['The Jakarta Post'],2013-10-05,The Jakarta Post,"The Depok HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPA Depok) has revealed an increase in the sexual transmission of HIV, surpassing the use of contaminated syringes as the most common route of transmission in the municipality. Commission secretary Herry Kuntowo said that sexual transmission was the cause of 62 percent of 188 cases recorded from January to August this year. Â€ÂœWe have also received reports from activists in HIV/AIDS prevention of 36 new cases and nearly all of them were infected through sexual transmission,Â€Â� he said on Tuesday, adding that many of them were housewives. The commission suspected the absence of a prostitution complex in the municipality had contributed to the situation. Â€ÂœThe sex workers work sporadically without monitoring or sufficient health education. It is impossible for activists to reach them because the sex workers move around to where the money is such as concerts and outdoor movie screenings,Â€Â� Herry said. He said the commission would establish community groups to support the campaign on HIV/AIDS awareness at district level to curb the transmission. Â€ÂœWe have better surveillance now because of solid coordination between the administration and activists which has enabled us to detect new cases. However, we fear that the 36 new cases is the tip of the iceberg. That is why we need a program that can reach to the neighborhood unit [RT] level.Â€Â� The commission had been in a hiatus for a couple of years, which disrupted the prevention and medication program for people living with HIV/AIDS. As a consequence many of them had to go to Jakarta for medication while others stopped taking medication altogether. Mayor Nur Mahmudi Ismail of the Islamic-based Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), eventually reactivated the commission in the wake of media reports of children with HIV who were being denied access to healthcare at hospitals. The municipality, however, is yet to include people with HIV/AIDS in its free healthcare program. Â€ÂœWe are still talking to the Depok administration about removing the stigma that HIV/AIDS is a lifestyle disease so that those infected with the virus are somehow undeserving of free medication. How do they explain that to infected housewives and children? Most of whom come from the lower economic brackets,Â€Â� said Radiaz Hages Triandha, activist with the NGO Kuldesak, which holds outreach programs for 45 people living with HIV/AIDS. In dealing with the situation, he said, the organization had to persuade doctors to provide free medication to patients with HIV/AIDS without having to reveal their patientsÂ€Â™ HIV status. Irwansyah from Stigma, another NGO focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, said that the commission had to work fast to name a referral hospital for people with HIV/AIDS. Â€ÂœThey are reluctant to go to public hospitals in Depok due to discrimination. They prefer going to hospitals in Jakarta or not going at all,Â€Â� he said. Herry said that the commission was still in talks to enable people with HIV/AIDS to get health checks at hospital without being coded to alarm doctors who might refuse to treat them. Â€ÂœNot only that, we are still struggling to be allowed by the administration to conduct campaigns on safe sex,Â€Â� he said.

Doctors hope for cure in a 2nd baby born with HIV,"A second American baby born with the AIDS virus may have had her infection put into remission and possibly cured by very early treatment Ã¢Â€Â” in this instance, four hours after birth",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-03-06,The Jakarta Post,"A second American baby born with the AIDS virus may have had her infection put into remission and possibly cured by very early treatment Â€Â” in this instance, four hours after birth. Doctors revealed the case Wednesday at an AIDS conference in Boston. The girl was born in suburban Los Angeles last April, a month after researchers announced the first case from Mississippi. That was a medical first that led doctors worldwide to rethink how fast and hard to treat infants born with HIV, and the California doctors followed that example. In another AIDS-related development, scientists have modified genes in the blood cells of a dozen adults to help them resist HIV. The results give hope that this approach might one day free at least some people from needing medicines to keep HIV under control, a form of cure. That study was published in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine. The Mississippi baby is now 3 1/2 and seems HIV-free despite no treatment for about two years. The Los Angeles baby is still getting AIDS medicines, so the status of her infection is not as clear. A host of sophisticated tests at multiple times suggest the LA baby has completely cleared the virus, said Dr. Deborah Persaud, a Johns Hopkins University physician who led the testing. The babys signs are different from what doctors see in patients whose infections are merely suppressed by successful treatment, she said. ""We dont know if the baby is in remission ... but it looks like that,"" said Dr. Yvonne Bryson, an infectious disease specialist at Mattel Childrens Hospital UCLA who consulted on the girls care. Doctors are cautious about suggesting she has been cured, ""but thats obviously our hope,"" Bryson said. Most HIV-infected moms in the U.S. get AIDS medicines during pregnancy, which greatly cuts the chances they will pass the virus to their babies. The Mississippi babys mom received no prenatal care and her HIV was discovered during labor. Doctors started the baby on treatment 30 hours after birth, even before tests could determine whether she was infected. The LA baby was born at Miller Childrens Hospital Long Beach, and ""we knew this mother from a previous pregnancy"" and that she was not taking her HIV medicines, said Dr. Audra Deveikis, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the hospital. The mom was given AIDS drugs during labor to try to prevent transmission of the virus, and Deveikis started the baby on them a few hours after birth. Tests later confirmed she had been infected, but does not appear to be now, nearly a year later. The baby is continuing treatment, is in foster care ""and looking very healthy,"" Bryson said. The Mississippi girl was treated until she was 18 months old, when doctors lost contact with her. Ten months later when she returned, they could find no sign of infection even though the mom had stopped giving her AIDS medicines. Bryson is one of the leaders of a federally funded study just getting underway to see if very early treatment can cure HIV infection. About 60 babies in the U.S. and other countries will get very aggressive treatment that will be discontinued if tests over a long time, possibly two years, suggest no active infection. ""These kids obviously will be followed very, very closely"" for signs of the virus, said Persaud, who described the LA case at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. The study in adults was prompted by an AIDS patient who appears cured after getting a cell transplant seven years ago in Berlin from a donor with natural immunity to the virus. Only about 1 percent of people have two copies of the gene that gives this protection, and researchers have been seeking a more practical way to get similar results. HIV usually infects blood cells through a protein on their surface called CCR5. A California company, Sangamo BioSciences Inc., makes a treatment that can knock out a gene that makes CCR5. Dr. Carl June at the University of Pennsylvania tested it in 12 HIV patients who had their blood filtered to remove some of their cells. The treated cells were infused back into the patients. Four weeks later, half of the patients were temporarily taken off AIDS medicines to see the gene therapys effect. The virus returned in all but one of them; that patient turned out to have one copy of the protective gene. ""We knew that the virus was going to come back in most of the patients,"" but the hope is that the modified cells eventually will outnumber the rest and give the patient a way to control viral levels without medicines, said Dr. Pablo Tebas, one of the Penn researchers. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored the work with Sangamo and Penn. ""The ultimate goal is to create an immune system in the body thats been edited genetically so the cells are not capable of being infected with HIV,"" said director Dr. Anthony Fauci, ""but we are a long way from there at this point."" Jay Johnson, 53, who works for Action AIDS, an advocacy and service organization in Philadelphia, had the treatment more than three years ago. Although the virus rebounded when he temporarily went off HIV medicines, tests show his modified blood cells are still multiplying.

Your letters: Pope: There are bigger issues than HIV,"There is no vaccine to prevent HIV and no cure for AIDS, but you can protect yourself from being infected",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-10,The Jakarta Post,"There is no vaccine to prevent HIV and no cure for AIDS, but you can protect yourself from being infected. The only way to prevent HIV is to avoid activities that increase the risk of contracting HIV. Basically, to prevent is always better than to cure. I believe, condoms can reduce the risk of HIV transmission, but not prevent HIV transmission. The website of The National Center for Biotechnology Information explains that the use of latex condoms is recommended for preventing HIV infection. Recent analysis states that the proper use of condoms will reduce the risk of HIV transmission by 60 to 70 percent. While those who consistently use condoms will reduce the risk of transmission by 90 to 95 percent. The figure does not illustrate that the use of condoms makes a person free from the risk of transmission of HIV and AIDS, but prevention is always better, especially for people who often have multiple sexual partners and a higher risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Gregdaru said that, Â€Âœa healthy lifestyle and faithfulness to your spouse indeed prevent HIV spread!Â€Â� But what if your spouse is a person who is infected with HIV since birth? Faithfulness would not be enough. If you do not know the HIV infection status of your spouse, always use a new condom every time you have sex. Condoms are available in various shapes, colors, textures, materials and different flavors. Condoms are available for both men and women. And use a dental dam for oral sex. A dental dam is a piece of cloth made of latex. HereÂ€Â™s what to consider when using condoms: 1. Check the expiry date 2. Choose condoms made of latex/polyurethane 3. Keep condoms away from heat and sunlight 4. Use only lubricants that are water based. Avoid using shortening, lotion, petroleum jelly or baby oil because it can break down the condom. (In general, condoms are already lubricated. Lubricants can prevent abrasions that can increase the possibility of infection) 5. Open the condom packaging with hands. Do not use teeth or sharp items 6. Choose a condom with a tip that can hold semen after ejaculation. Put on the condom after Mr. P stiffens and before touching your partnerÂ€Â™s body, and do not let any air get trapped inside it 7. To remove the condom from Mr. P, pull slowly and be careful not to spill the liquid inside 8. Wrap the used condom in tissue and put it in the trash. After disposing of it, do not forget to wash your hands with soap. Maybe that will help you.

Referring to the World Health Organization (WHO) rule of thumb, which says that one identified HIV-positive person represents nine other unidentified ones, it is calculated that in reality, 450 people in the employment group have the deadly viral infection. Â€ÂœPeople who work in the transportation sector are among those with a high risk of at least becoming part of the transmission chain of HIV,Â€Â� Yogyakarta AIDS Commission (KPA Yogyakarta) secretary Riswanto said on the sidelines of a seminar on HIV/AIDS control in Yogyakarta on Tuesday.

The Transportation Ministry has been appointed as the leading sector in the commemoration of World AIDS Day 2015, which falls on Dec. 1. At the event, the Yogyakarta Health Agency offered free HIV tests and 13 men agreed to take the tests voluntarily. Your comments: Actually religion can help here.

The biggest at-risk group is women married to men who have sex outside the marriage and/or do drugs. We know we have 6 million hardcore drug users here, according to Crocodile Dundee, and the estimate of sex workers approaches 1 million according to our own stats. Maybe we need an island surrounded by nasty beasts to house all these bad people. Kanti Indonesia can test all they want and toss out numbers all over the place. Until they have a working Public Health Department that can investigate and educate that is all they will have: growing numbers. So, they are testing all these people and finding HIV.

HIV/AIDS program should involve GWL,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Indonesia, especially in West Java, with 42",['The Jakarta Post'],2013-09-13,The Jakarta Post,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Indonesia, especially in West Java, with 42.5 million inhabitants, continues to spread. Bony Wiem Lestari, a researcher at the epidemiology and biostatistics department of BandungÂ€Â™s Padjadjaran UniversityÂ€Â™s (Unpad) medical school, says that housewives, or women who are currently in the low-risk category, could be at risk in the future. Â€ÂœThis is due to infection from their spouses, especially now when infection from men who have sex with other men is rising,Â€Â� said Bony in a seminar titled Â€ÂœWill HIV-Generalized Epidemic Occur in West Java?Â€Â� at the Unpad medical school in Bandung last Thursday. As an illustration, Bony said 432 people were infected with HIV in 2005, with a further 287 with AIDS. This rose in 2011 to 1,556 people infected with HIV and 892 people with AIDS. Although the number of AIDS cases dropped to 461 in 2012, the number of HIV cases increased to 1,895. Failure to handle the HIV/AIDS cases appropriately, said Bony, could lead to around 90,000 people infected with HIV by 2015. Â€ÂœMaximum intervention is required,Â€Â� said Bony, adding that HIV/AIDS prevention programs for the gay, transvestite, and men who have sex with other men (GWL) groups remained inadequate. So far, said Bony, the source of infection was largely from the gay group, contributing to around 50 percent of the cases. Okkeu Supriyadi, an activist from Srikandi Pasundan, a group focusing on GWL communities in Bandung, said his group faced difficulties in carrying out counseling due to limited funds. One of the obstacles in advocating HIV/AIDS issues with the GWL communities, said Okkeu, was peopleÂ€Â™s lack of awareness. He cited as an example when he took dozens of transvestites to the community health clinic (Puskesmas) to undergo sexually transmitted disease (STD) examinations. Â€ÂœSome of the Puskesmas staff had apparently provided a responsible person to attend to a patient. If the appointed person was unavailable, other medical workers refused to treat the patient,Â€Â� said Okkeu. Based on research carried out by Srikandi Pasundan, only 43 percent, or 14,324 members of the gay community and only 45 percent of members of the transvestite community, or 405 people were already familiar with HIV/AIDS information. HIV/AIDS counseling for members of the GWL community, said Okkeu, should be enhanced because data showed that the number of younger members, aged between 15 and 24 years old, of the GWL community was increasing. Â€ÂœThe increase is between five and 10 people each month in Bandung,Â€Â� said Okkeu. Regarding the prevention of HIV/AIDS, West Java AIDS Prevention Commission secretary Pantja Widi said the issue could be resolved if every level of society was involved in the HIV/AIDS prevention drive. Â€ÂœHIV is a community health issue and has turned into a social issue. It is not only the responsibility of people in the health sector, but all of us as a society as well,Â€Â� said Pantja, adding that the spread of HIV knew no boundaries of age, sex or occupation.

"Jakarta lays on free, confidential HIV tests for all",Check up: A medical official takes a blood sample from Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama as part of a program of free HIV/AIDS tests at the City Council in Jakarta on Tuesday,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-10-23,The Jakarta Post,"Seeing an increase in HIV cases in Jakarta, the city administration and the Jakarta chapter of the National AIDS Commission (KPAP Jakarta) are offering free, confidential HIV testing and counseling for a month from Tuesday to Nov. 21. Teams manned by the Jakarta Health Agency and Commission staff as well as relevant NGOs will be deployed to provide a Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) program in public places, including shopping malls, targeting a wider section of the populace in the cityÂ€Â™s five municipalities. Free tests are already available at Puskesmas (community health centers) and state hospitals for the holders of the Jakarta Health Card (KJS). However, organized tests previously only targeted high-risk groups in red-light districts and drug offenders in prisons. Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki Â€ÂœAhokÂ€Â� Tjahaja Purnama, who is KPAP Jakarta executive chairman, took the test on Tuesday to mark the launch of the program at City Hall. Â€ÂœI am willingly taking the test now. Why donÂ€Â™t others take it too?Â€Â� he said, calling out to the public and civil servants. Â€ÂœItÂ€Â™s just like having diabetes. The sooner you know you have it, the easier it will be to be treated. It will turn to a life-threatening condition if HIV develops into AIDS.Â€Â� The number of HIV/AIDS cases has increased over the years. Data from the National Commission on HIV/AIDS Prevention in 2012 showed Jakarta was the province with the most incidences of HIV/AIDS. KPAP Jakarta recorded 20,775 HIV cases in Jakarta in 2012, an increase of 9.3 percent from last yearÂ€Â™s 18,999. Meanwhile, the number of AIDS cases slightly increased from 5,117 in 2011 to 5,118 in 2012. Jakarta Health Agency head Dien Emmawati said most of the new cases were found among non high-risk groups. Â€ÂœAccording to our survey, sexually active heterosexual people topped injecting drug users as having the most potential to be infected,Â€Â� she said. KPAP Jakarta secretary Rohana Manggala said the VCT was intended to break the Â€Âœiceberg phenomenonÂ€Â� where only an estimation of 40 percent of HIV cases had been revealed, suspecting that the non high-risk groups, including housewives and children, sat at the bottom of the iceberg. Â€ÂœThe test aims also to eradicate discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS as the public in general can easily take the test, so people do not think it a curse or a disease of sinners,Â€Â� she said, adding the program would increase the awareness of people toward HIV/AIDS. Rohana said the commission targeted 10,000 people to take the tests in a month and planned to conduct the same program next year. The health agency and the commission would upload the location of the mobile VCT teams at kpapjakarta.org. Dien said the puskesmas also provided the same service for free but providing the service in public spaces would encourage more people to take the test. Â€ÂœWe use the new HIV screening with Nucleid Acid Testing [NAT] method, which is more accurate,Â€Â� she said, adding the result could be known in only 15 minutes. It costs around Rp 300,000 (US$26.7) to take the test in private hospitals. Dien said the VCT program was also crucial for pregnant women. Â€ÂœIf the mother is infected, she should take medication to reduce the risk of transferring the virus to the baby.Â€Â� Ahok said the city administration was concerned more about low-income people who engaged in unprotected sex. Â€ÂœMiddle- and upper-class people are usually aware of the risk of HIV/AIDS,Â€Â� he said. According to the provincial commission, among the HIV-infected are teenagers. However, in its survey revealed last year, only 21.7 percent of those in the 15-24 age group of respondents were well informed about HIV/AIDS and its prevention.

Sexual transmission of HIV on high alert,The Jakarta HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPAP) warned that the increasing sexual transmission of HIV over the past two years was exacerbated by the unpopular use of condoms among people with multiple partners,['The Jakarta Post'],2013-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The Jakarta HIV/AIDS Prevention Commission (KPAP) warned that the increasing sexual transmission of HIV over the past two years was exacerbated by the unpopular use of condoms among people with multiple partners. John Alubwaman, head of the prevention division at the commission, said it was still difficult for society to accept condoms as there were still many circulating stigmas against the device that could prevent sexually-transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. The stigmas, he said, included the labeling of haram (forbidden in Islam), uncomfortable sex and possible condom leakage. Â€ÂœThe sexual transmission of HIV is the most crucial issue right now and the only way to prevent it is by using condoms. However, the use of condoms in Jakarta is still very low,Â€Â� he said. The use of condoms in high-risk sex is one of the indicators in the combat against HIV/AIDS in the Millennium Development Goals. Last year, efforts by Health Minister Nafsiah Mboi to distribute free condoms to those who faced the highest risks were hampered by allegations that she would distribute them to teenagers. A group of Muslim groups such as Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, popular Muslim cleric Yusuf Mansur and lawmaker Ribka Tjiptaning, were among those who saw the policy as a slippery slope that could open the gateway to adultery and casual sex in society, especially among the young. In 2012, the cumulative number of HIV infections through heterosexual intercourse cases in Jakarta had reached 637 cases, higher than some 400 cases involving drug users who shared unsterilized syringes, according to the commission. Sexual transmission was also the cause of 62 percent of 188 cases recorded in Depok city from January to August this year. Data from the Health Ministry said the number of HIV cases from April 1987 to 2013 in Jakarta had reached 24,807, while the number of AIDS cases had reached 6,299. KPAP secretary Rohana Manggala said the commission would continue promoting condoms among people with high-risk lifestyles and other efforts to curb the number of HIV/AIDS cases. She said the rising number of people undergoing Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS was a good sign. In October, Deputy Governor Basuki Â€ÂœAhokÂ€Â� Tjahaja Purnama encouraged civil servants in Jakarta to take part in the program. Â€ÂœPeople used to silently look for information because they were afraid and suddenly, they died. Nowadays, people flock to have their blood checked,Â€Â� Rohana said, adding the number of VCT participants had reached over 10,000 people as of November.

Midwives to be involved in HIV/AIDS prevention,"In a bid to stem the rising mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Semarang municipality, Central Java, the local administration will enlist the help of midwives",['The Jakarta Post'],2013-04-27,The Jakarta Post,"In a bid to stem the rising mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Semarang municipality, Central Java, the local administration will enlist the help of midwives. According to chairman of the municipal branch of the Indonesian Family Planning Association (PKBI), Dwi Yoga Yulianto, midwives play a vital role in preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. Â€ÂœMidwives can reach more women of reproductive age in all levels of society, especially the pregnant ones,Â€Â� Dwi said on the sidelines of a training session held for midwives on pregnant mother reference and HIV/AIDS prevention in women and children in Semarang on Friday. Some 80 percent of expectant mothers, Dwi said, go to midwives for a check-up during their pregnancy. Midwives, he added, were also considered to have a better rapport with patients compared to doctors. More importantly, they deal with more patients from impoverished families that have limited access to health and good understanding of HIV/AIDS. Once involved in HIV/AIDS prevention measures, the midwives will be tasked with monitoring pregnant women for HIV infection. Â€ÂœIf they observe signs of infection, they will send the woman for a test,Â€Â� he said, referring to the PMTCT program that comprises four activities or prongs. The four prongs include offering all pregnant women HIV tests; providing HIV-positive pregnant women with anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs; selecting the right family-planning program for HIV-positive women and deciding the safest birth methods for HIV-positive pregnant women followed by providing the newborns with the best nutrition. Data at the Semarang municipal health agency show that HIV/AIDS transmission from mother to child accounts for 2.6 percent of the total HIV/AIDS cases reported nationwide. In Semarang itself, during the period of 1995 to 2012, there were 2,351 reported cases of HIV infection and 364 cases of AIDS of which 57 proved fatal. HIV-positive expectant mothers numbered 13 in 2011 and 28 the following year. The move by the municipal administration to involve midwives in HIV/AIDS prevention measures received a warm welcome from Bambang Darmawan, a supervisor with NGO Griya Asa, which has specialized in HIV/AIDS monitoring in the Sunan Kuning red light district in Semarang. Bambang said that prostitutes often got pregnant despite the fact that they were high-risk in terms of HIV transmission. During 2012 alone, he said, 35 commercial sex workers operating in Sunan Kuning were infected with HIV. He also said that the majority of prostitutes went to midwives when they got pregnant. The government, according to Bambang, should conduct PMTCT tests consistently in all high-risk areas such as Yogyakarta, Surabaya (East Java), Batam (Riau Islands), Denpasar (Bali) and Semarang. Unless well handled, the possibility of HIV transmission from HIV-positive expectant mothers is between 24 percent and 45 percent. With early detection, Bambang, said the possibility could be reduced to just 5 percent. Separately head of the training division of the Semarang branch of the Indonesian Midwives Association (IBI), Suprapti, assured that all the associationÂ€Â™s 500 members in the city had been conducting HIV early-detection programs.

Cambodian on trial for infecting more than 100 with HIV,"Yem Chhrin (center) an unlicensed medical practitioner, is escorted by prison guards at Battambang provencial court, in Battambang province, northwester of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Tuesday",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-10-20,The Jakarta Post,"An unlicensed medical practitioner who infected more than 100 villagers in northwestern Cambodia with HIV by reusing unclean needles went on trial Tuesday, facing three charges including murder, his lawyer said. Yem Chhrin faces up to life in prison if found guilty of murder, intentionally spreading HIV Â€Â” the virus that causes AIDS Â€Â” and practicing medicine without a license, his lawyer, Em Sovann, said by telephone from Battambang town, where a provincial court is holding the five-day trial. Yem Chhrin was arrested last December and taken into protective custody, fearing revenge lynching by residents of Roka village, where at least 106 of the 800 people tested were found to be infected with HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. Local newspapers have put the number at 300. The infected range in age from 3 to 82, and include Buddhist monks. At least 10 victims are reported to have died. Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in the world, has inadequate health care facilities, especially in rural areas, where villagers often have no recourse but to rely on unlicensed medical practitioners who have trained themselves to treat minor ailments and to give injections. Yem Chhrin, 53, was one such practitioner. ""I was shocked when I learned I was infected. ... I am sure the HIV virus I had was from Yem Chhrins treatment,"" Leurn Lum, one of the 120 villagers who filed the police complaint, said by telephone. ""I am a good husband, as I have never had sex with other women in my life."" Leurn Lum, 51, said he had never sought treatment from anyone other than Yem Chhrin. He found out he had HIV in late 2014, and his wife had also tested positive. He said he wants to see Yem Chhrin punished. Some villagers said Yem Chhrin had a good reputation for his years of dedicated service to the village by providing treatment even though he lacked formal training or certification. ""Whether it was day or night, whether the patient had money to pay for the treatment or not, Yem Chhrin treated them regardless. I think he was a good neighbor,"" said Chay Savorn, a 60-year-old woman who received treatment from him and was later found to be HIV positive. She said she decided not to join the police complaint even though four other people in her family have been infected with HIV Â€Â” her daughter, her mother, a 3-year-old granddaughter and a 57-year-old sibling. Em Sovann, the lawyer, said his client has acknowledged reusing syringes for treatment of patients. But he ""has repeatedly said before the police and court officials during pre-trial detention that he had no intention to transmit the deadly virus to any of his patients,"" Em Sovann said. He said he will try to get two of the charges Â€Â” murder and intentionally spreading HIV Â€Â” dropped by the court. Yem Chhrins wife, Nhoum Chenda, said her husband never believed that the villagers were infected because of his actions. ""The HIV virus transmitted to those villagers must be from ... something else that we dont know about right now,"" she said by phone. She added that since her husbands arrest, she also had to flee to another province, fearing that angry villagers would kill her. Cambodia had a high HIV prevalence rate of 2.0 percent in 1998, but an aggressive campaign to promote safe sex brought the figure down to an estimated 0.7 percent last year, according to the UN agency that spearheads the worldwide fight against AIDS.",{},"['infected', 'virus', 'infecting', 'chhrin', 'hiv', 'cambodian', 'treatment', 'sovann', 'trial', 'murder', '100', 'villagers', 'yem', 'lawyer']","An unlicensed medical practitioner who infected more than 100 villagers in northwestern Cambodia with HIV by reusing unclean needles went on trial Tuesday, facing three charges including murder, his lawyer said.

HIV prevalence grows among RI teens,"Do as I do: Actress Raline Syah (center) has her blood sample taken for an HIV test during a 2015 World AIDS Day observance in Surapati Square in Central Jakarta, on Sunday",['The Jakarta Post'],2015-11-30,The Jakarta Post,"Indonesia is witnessing a growing rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among adolescents, the most vulnerable population, a UN Asia Pacific report has shown. The report, released by the Asia Pacific Inter-Agency Task Team on Young Key Populations and UNICEF just ahead of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, finds that Indonesia is one of two countries in the region to have seen an increase in the estimated number of new HIV infections among adolescents aged 14 to 19 from 2004 to 2014. Â€ÂœThe HIV burden among adolescents falls heaviest on 10 countries, namely India, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Cambodia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and Pakistan, which together account for 98 percent of adolescents living with HIV in the region,Â€Â� the report said. According to the report, the estimated number of new HIV infections among adolescents in Indonesia stood at 15,000 in 2014, rising from 12,000 in 2004. Besides Indonesia, new HIV infections among those aged 15 to 19 in the Philippines also rose from an estimated 800 in 2010 to 1,210 in 2014 and 1,403 in 2015. Other countries in the region, however, achieved substantial drops in the number of new HIV infections among adolescents. The figure in Vietnam, for instance, dropped to 2,600 in 2014 from 5,900 in 2004, while MyanmarÂ€Â™s fell to 1,600 in 2014 from 4,300 in 2004. Thailand enjoyed similar success, the rate there decreasing to 1,500 in 2014 from 4,300 in 2004. The Health MinistryÂ€Â™s director of disease control and environmental health, Mohammad Subuh, said that while HIV infections in Indonesia were most prevalent among people between the ages of 20 and 49, many in this group may have been infected since adolescence. Â€ÂœThe incubation period [of HIV] is between five and 10 years. So if someone is diagnosed with HIV when he is 20 years old, he might have been infected since he was 15 years old,Â€Â� Subuh told The Jakarta Post on Sunday. The report also said that individuals in their second decade were more vulnerable to being infected with HIV than adults, and harder to care for after transmission, for a host of biological, social, psychological and legal reasons. Â€ÂœYet they are a much less powerful constituency, often with low visibility and weak voices. To date they have been a neglected component of national HIV testing, treatment, care and support strategies. This inequity needs to be redressed Â€Â“ urgently,Â€Â� the report said. IndonesiaÂ€Â™s number of HIV infections among adolescents defied the global trend. Between 2000 and 2014, the global annual rate of new HIV infections among adolescents aged 15-19 fell substantially, mainly because of the decline in new cases from almost 200,000 to 100,000 in eastern and southern Africa. Meanwhile, the annual number of new HIV cases among adolescents in the entire Asia Pacific region has declined only slightly since 2004. Overall, the number of HIV infections in Indonesia rose to 177,000 in 2015 from 150,296 cases in 2014, according to data from the Health Ministry. Â€ÂœBut the number mainly rose because there were more people getting tested. So we are currently only seeing the tip of the iceberg,Â€Â� Subuh said. Â€ÂœWe are targeting HIV prevalence of below 0.5 percent in Indonesia, or around 550,000. So even if the incidence of HIV in Indonesia keeps rising, as long as it is below 550,000, it means it is still under control.Â€Â� Furthermore, the number of deaths from HIV in Indonesia has dropped significantly from 40 percent in 2005 to 0.4 percent in 2015, showing remarkable strides since the advent in 1996 of antiretroviral drugs, which suppress HIV, according to Subuh. Though not a cure, the therapy creates a virtuous circle. The less the virus is in circulation, the less likely it is that people become infected. Since the first case in Indonesia in 1987, HIV has spread to 381 of the nationÂ€Â™s 498 regencies and cities. Last year, Jakarta, with 32,782 cases, had the highest prevalence of HIV of any province in the country. ------------------- To receive comprehensive and earlier access to The Jakarta Post print edition, please subscribe to our epaper through iOS iTunes, Androids Google Play, Blackberry World or Microsofts Windows Store.

Surakarta reports increasing number of TB patients infected with HIV,"Thirty percent of 120 tuberculosis patients being treated at the Surakarta Community Pulmonary Health Center (BBKPM) are HIV positive, the head of the center said on Friday",['The Jakarta Post'],2014-03-07,The Jakarta Post,"Thirty percent of 120 tuberculosis patients being treated at the Surakarta Community Pulmonary Health Center (BBKPM) are HIV positive, the head of the center said on Friday. BBKPM head Sigit Priohutomo said the figure was found from voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) conducted in 2012-2013. The figure has kept increasing since the first VCT was conducted in 2010. During 2010-2011, 20 percent of some 30 TB patients were found to be HIV positive. In 2011-2012, the number of TB patients tested increased to 100 to make the figure more representative. At the time, 400 patients were being treated at the BBKPM, and it was found that 25 percent of the tested patients were HIV positive. Â€ÂœThe percentage keeps increasing, although the number of patients undergoing VCT examinations has also increased,Â€Â� Sigit said. He estimated that if VCT examinations were conducted on all patients, the number of HIV infections would probably be higher. VCT only can be done upon a patientÂ€Â™s consent. Â€ÂœIt is their right.

An HIV/AIDS control officer working for the Surakarta Health Agency, Wahyu Indianto, shared SigitÂ€Â™s premise, saying that people with HIV could easily contract TB.

Sharon Ruth Lewin: New hope for AIDS cure,(JP/Rita A,['The Jakarta Post'],2014-01-15,The Jakarta Post,"Thirty years ago when people got infected with HIV/AIDS, it was like being hit with a death sentence Â€Â”going through the incredible pain of this vicious condition with no cure available Â€ÂœAt that time, I treated so many patients with HIV, mostly young gay men in Australia, and I saw them suffering tremendously with HIV-related infections affecting their brains and immune systems with loads of pain, emotion, stigma and discrimination thrown in,Â€Â� remembered Sharon Ruth Lewin. Â€ÂœThese kinds of situations motivated me to conduct medical research to find ways to ease their pain.Â€Â� Thanks to dedicated scientists around the world, the search for a cure for HIV has made great strides since the discovery of the virus in the early 1980s and today treatment is so efficacious that many people with the virus can live a virtually normal life. Lewin is among one of the foremost groups of these scientists and an active member of the International AIDS Society (IAS), a group currently developing a global scientific strategy for HIV research to end the epidemic that has already claimed 30 million lives worldwide. In January 2013, as a professor of medicine at Monash University and director of the infectious diseases unit at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, she led a team from the hospital to uncover HIVÂ€Â™s genetic hiding place and found a drug able to seek it out so that the deadly virus could be destroyed. The research also involved teams from the Burnet Institute, the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center and AustraliaÂ€Â™s National Association of people living with HIV/AIDS. Â€ÂœTraditional antiretroviral [ARV] medications have been able to stop the virus infecting cells, giving patients a greater life expectancy,Â€Â� the professor said on the sidelines of the recent International AIDS Asia Pacific (ICAAP) XI in Bangkok. Â€ÂœBut, the virus remained hiding in their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), unable to be found and treated so that patients would still have to undergo expensive lifelong ART,Â€Â� she explained Seeking out the killer virus with doses of a highly toxic cancer drug was a huge step in curing the disease, once viewed as incurable, added the professor. By using the cancer drug, Vorinostat, for two weeks, Lewin had been able to rouse sleeping HIV-infected cells so they could be detected. The team of researchers was able to bring the virus to notice in 18 HIV patients in a trial that concluded in January 2013. Â€ÂœIt was a kind of shock-and-kill the virus,Â€Â� she said. The professor was hoping a new generation of drugs able to kick-start the immune system might now be able to kill the virus. There are more possibilities of getting rid of it by making it visible to drugs and visible to the immune system. Â€ÂœThe research will take a long time before we can make a final conclusion,Â€Â� she said Â€ÂœBut, I feel so optimistic and energized. There has been so much progress in HIV/AIDS cure research since I became involved in the global research effort in the very early days of the epidemic,Â€Â� she said, adding that most scientists had seen some light and hope of ending the epidemic. The success of ARV therapy has led many people now to ask whether the world can stop AIDS. ARV drugs and antiretroviral treatments (ART) are now available and affordable around the world, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Â€ÂœThe treatment has become quite simple. In the past, patients with HIV had to consume 20 pills a day. Now, any patient with HIV will only have to consume one pill per day,Â€Â� explained Lewin. Huge reductions have been seen in rates of death and suffering when use is made of a potent ARV regimen, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Widening access to antiretroviral treatments can also reduce HIV transmissions. Â€ÂœHIV/AIDS has now turned into a manageable disease. It is no longer seen as a primary death threat. Patients with HIV, especially in their early stages, now have the chance to get wide access to ARV treatments with almost 96 percent life expectancy and will feel less pain.Â€Â� Aside from ART treatments, scientists have also conducted a great deal of groundbreaking research. Several of the milestones in research affected Timothy Brown, also known as the Â€ÂœBerlin patientÂ€Â�, who was cured of HIV after a bone marrow transplant from a donor with genetic resistance to HIV infection. The two Â€ÂœBoston patientsÂ€Â� Â€Â” nicknamed for the city where they were treated Â€Â” also received bone-marrow transplants with cells that were not resistant to HIV. Both of them seemed to be free of the virus for months after stopping treatment. In late December, researchers reported that the virus had recurred in both of the Boston patients. Bone marrow transplants and gene therapy to cure HIV might be too complicated and too expensive, she said. Â€ÂœAny research into a HIV cure has always been important, despite the results. This will lead to further research and clinical trials. Finding HIV/AIDS cures and best treatments have always been time and energy consuming,Â€Â� she said. Scientists, she said, needed to inform the public in an honest and measured way what they were working at and the challenges they were facing. Â€ÂœI am so passionate and excited that weÂ€Â™ve reached this stage in the research into a HIV cure. But, the search for an HIV cure has still a long way to go and will require innovation, sustainable funding and political commitments from all parties. LewinÂ€Â™s other important step is to become co-chair of the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne next July. The international chair of the conference will be Nobel laureate Professor FranÃƒÂ§oise BarrÃƒÂ©-Sinoussi, AIDS 2014 International Chair, President of IAS and Director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. The Melbourne conferenceÂ€Â™s theme will be Â€ÂœStepping up the PaceÂ€Â�. The theme reflects the significant progress being made in the scientific world toward HIV/AIDS prevention, cure and treatment and the optimism about the falling rates of new HIV infections worldwide. Â€ÂœBut that is not enough. We have to accelerate the pace to achieve zero AIDS,Â€Â� said Lewin. Stepping up the pace reminds us that, despite the significant scientific gains being reported in many countries, success has not translated into an effective response in many others including notably in many parts of the Asia Pacific region Â€ÂœAIDS 2014 is a significant opportunity to mobilize stakeholders and build on the present momentum necessary to change the course of the epidemic for everyone affected,Â€Â� she said.",{},"['able', 'ruth', 'lewin', 'virus', 'arv', 'international', 'hiv', 'patients', 'research', 'treatments', 'hope', 'cure', 'aids', 'sharon']","Bone marrow transplants and gene therapy to cure HIV might be too complicated and too expensive, she said.

For the second phase, we will receive another 10 million PrePex units [from the foundation],Â€Â� Karma said on Monday on the sidelines of a free circumcision service held to introduce PrePex use at the regional administration-run hospital RSUD Dok II Jayapura. The hospital, according to Karma, would open such a service until Friday. In 2007, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS argued that circumcised men could reduce the risk of HIV infection by approximately 60 percent in high-risk areas. The spread of HIV infections in Papua is alarming, according to the Papua KPAD. HIV in Papua is mainly transmitted through unsafe sexual intercourse. Unlike regular circumcision surgery, PrePex-assisted circumcision is much easier to perform. After the male genitalia is cleaned and measured, anesthesia cream is applied on the tip of it to get rid of a tingling sensation. Then the PrePex, which is a set of two rings, one black and one white, is inserted onto the genitals according to the respective size. The white ring is put inside the genital skin while the black one is put around the outer skin. The rings will clamp the skin, stopping the flow of blood, nerves and nutrition to the skin that will be cut off. Â€ÂœAs the flow of the blood, nerves and nutrition stops, the skin will automatically feel nothing so that no pain will be felt and no blood will come out,Â€Â� said Suwardi, one of the hospital doctors who assisted in MondayÂ€Â™s circumcision service. After the rings are attached, patients could engage in normal activities and then return to the hospital a week later to have the dead skin cut off and the rings released, said Karma, who was also among the patients. Reynold Suwae, a 16-year-old local student completing senior high school in Malang, East Java, was also among the patients. Â€ÂœI happened to be on vacation. I am interested to join the KPAD circumcision program because it involves no pain and no blood coming out. The circumcision doesnÂ€Â™t disturb my vacation,Â€Â� Reynold said.

World AIDS Day interview: It's still taboo to talk about sex in Indonesia,Ayu Oktariani,['The Jakarta Post'],2015-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"In connection to World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, TheJakartaPost.coms Anton Hermansyah sat down with Indonesia AIDS Coalition campaigner Ayu Oktariani, who is also an HIV infected activist, to talk about AIDS education in Indonesia and HIV awareness. Ayu was diagnosed with HIV and hepatitis C in 2009. She was infected by her late husband, an intravenous drug user. As a mother of a healthy daughter, she realized that she had to get past the emotional turmoil and move on. She eventually became an activist for awareness on both HIV and hepatitis C. She was a finalist in the 2014 Kartini Next Generation Awards. Her campaigning of the health minister through change.org was success in making PT Roche Indonesia lower the price of the drug pegylated interferon, on which it held the patent, to make it more affordable. Question: How much HIV/AIDS awareness is there in Indonesia? Answer: In my opinion, after 2012, HIV awareness improved because there was more information. But the incidence of infection is not decreasing. Even though awareness has increased, so too has the infection rate. The stigma attached to HIV is still prevalent here. What facts about the condition are not widely known among the public? Many people dont realize how the virus is transmitted. Some dont even know exactly what HIV is. They know its a deadly virus, like a curse. They just learn about it from mouth to mouth, which deviates a lot. If they are asked about it, they just answer based on their own perception, which is wrong. HIV is a virus that attacks the bodys immune system, period. From the beginning, the public understood that it had widely spread but they didnt understand the ways that it could spread (including through unprotected sex, childbirth and needle sharing). From the ways it can be spread, which is the most common? In recent three years it has been sexual intercourse, especially between heterogeneous couples -- from man to woman and vice versa. Prior to 2012, it was intravenous drug use. Infection among homosexual couples was also high. Recently, it is coming from heterogeneous couples and from mom to baby. What is the main hurdle in HIV/AIDS education in Indonesia? Indonesians have been conditioned to think that talking about sex is taboo. They just know that it is wrong to have sex outside of marriage. But we cannot control incidences of sex outside the home. It can happen between students, teacher and student, and siblings. Safe sex education that should be given to teenagers at an early stage cannot be done as schools reject the idea. They claim that educating students about sex and condoms is the same as condoning casual sex. But we cannot ignore the fact that casual sex between teenagers happens. I dont have the number, but there are plenty of cases revealed in the news and social media. If casual sex cannot be prevented, we could at least suggest that it be practiced safely. How should people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) be treated? According to the community, they dont want special treatment. We can eat, we dont need help walking, they say. It is wrong to treat PLWHA any differently from other people. PLWHA still face stigma. They are considered sick people with a contagious disease, sinners. Even the terminology used by the government is wrong. They are referred to as sufferers. It is wrong to depict PLWHA as people who suffer. Right now my team is struggling to promote the use of PLWHA instead of sufferer. Images in advertisements on TV or in magazines always give a negative image, someone who is sick and sad. It can be seen in AIDS Day advertisements. We also have inspirational figures, people who have successfully self-medicated, HIV-positive women who have uninfected babies. The ads aim to make people pity us and nothing more. We should make smarter public communication. What about medication? Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are now widely available in Indonesia, but not as much as in Europe or the US as brands here are limited. But PLWHA can get it freely in the hospital. If you are infected you can go to a referral hospital or public health center (Puskesmas). A list of places is available at the Health Ministry or you can ask around the communities. What one needs to pay for is just supporting health tests, such as blood tests or treatment for any accompanying infections. Medication is mostly free and easily accessed. It is available throughout Indonesia. How is the quality of medical treatment? Every reference hospital has a working group (Pokja) that is well trained. But I cannot not deny that there have been cases in which the doctor or nurse still use incorrect terms or make discriminatory remarks, but they are individual cases. An example of discrimination, like the use of suffererÂ€Â™, is the way of discriminatively looking at the background of PLWHAs. There is a tendency to discriminate against people having an HIV test. Like the people who contracted it through jajan (sex with a prostitute) or prostitutes themselves. These people are usually discriminated against or judged as deviants by hospital staff. Also people who have difficulty getting recognition, such as lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBT). When I tested positive, why couldnÂ€Â™t they just treat me without judging my background? But those are just minor cases; there are hospitals and Puskesmas with excellent services. Do people know that an infected woman can deliver a healthy baby? The thirst for information is lacking, even with my mother and among the people around me. Except among those who are close to the community and people participating in the Caring Citizens movement or Puskesmas activists. In future, what should be included in HIV awareness campaigns and what can the media do? The dissemination of information on HIV has been carried out for 30 years, which is not a short period of time. Progress is slow, but I canÂ€Â™t say it has failed. I and other activists try to fill the gap and not limit ourselves to the communities but also engage the public. The media could turn bad news into good news. I often research what topics the media focuses on regarding HIV and most media outlets just care about the numbers. How many are infected, how many women are infected and the number of LGBT infected. It is sexist, but maybe it is aimed at spicing up a story to make people read it, I dont know. I wish there were more smart media outlets that focused on the success of the programs. Ones that would run articles on how to protect yourself and how to treat PLWHAs; ones that donÂ€Â™t intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against PLWHAs. For example, there are a lot of infected women who can deliver a healthy baby and married PLWHA with an uninfected spouse who remains healthy. Can you give us a brief rundown on the data? I dont remember the exactly figures, but the Health Ministry presently estimates HIV cases at 500,000 to 600,000, but actual reported cases are just 150,000. There are people who get infected but donÂ€Â™t want to be tested or take medication. The Health Ministry releases data on HIV every three months, so the figures are current.

Search for HIV vaccine resumes with test in South Africa,"The latest attempt in the long, frustrating search for a vaccine against HIV began in South Africa on Wednesday, as scientists test a beefed-up version of the only shot ever to show a glimmer of protection.",['The Jakarta Post'],2016-12-01,The Jakarta Post,"The latest attempt in the long, frustrating search for a vaccine against HIV began in South Africa on Wednesday, as scientists test a beefed-up version of the only shot ever to show a glimmer of protection. The stakes are high. Its the first study of its kind begun in seven years, and even moderate success could prove important not only in hard-hit South Africa, where more than 1,000 people a day are infected with HIV, but beyond. ""If an HIV vaccine were found to work in South Africa, it could dramatically alter the course of the pandemic,"" Glenda Gray, president of the South African Medical Research Council, said Wednesday at one of the test clinics in Soshanguve township outside Pretoria. The council is helping run the study. Developing a vaccine against the virus that causes AIDS is one of sciences greatest challenges, and the field is littered with failures. Better medications have greatly improved survival for many people, turning the virus into a chronic disease rather than a quick killer. But there is no cure, and there still are a million AIDS-related deaths a year. The new study is based on the only vaccine attempt ever to show even marginal effectiveness, in Thailand in 2009 â€” a two-vaccine combination that cut the risk of HIV infection by 31 percent over 3Â½ years. That wasnt nearly effective enough to use outside of research, but scientists immediately started trying to modify and improve that combination. A small safety test in South Africa earlier this year showed that the modified vaccine combo was promising enough for a major study to probe if it really works. The new vaccine aims to provide ""greater and more sustained protection,"" Mookho Malahleha, a researcher involved in the project who was at the Soshanguve clinic. The new study, funded in part by the US governments National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will enroll 5,400 sexually active men and women between 18 and 35 at sites across South Africa. Volunteers for the study will be randomly assigned to receive either five vaccine injections over a year or five placebo shots. Results are expected in 2020. Participants who become infected with HIV will be referred to local medical providers for care and treatment and will be counseled on how to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus. People cannot be infected through the vaccine. The vaccine combination consists of two experimental shots â€” ALVAC-HIV supplied by drug maker Sanofi Pasteur, and a protein vaccine supplied by GlaxoSmithKline â€” that form whats called a ""prime-boost"" approach. One shot primes the immune system to attack HIV and another strengthens that response. For the South African trial, the shots were adapted to the most common HIV strain in southern Africa, and scientists added an additional booster dose in hopes of prolonging protection. South Africa has more than 6.8 million people living with HIV, but the country has had success in rolling out an HIV drug treatment program for 3.1 million people, the largest in the world, according to Doctors Without Borders. Life expectancy in South Africa, which sank as the epidemic grew, has rebounded from 57.1 years in 2009 to 62.9 years in 2014. ___ AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard in Washington contributed to this report.",{},"['africa', 'search', 'infected', 'vaccine', 'test', 'hiv', 'scientists', 'million', 'medical', 'study', 'south', 'resumes']","The latest attempt in the long, frustrating search for a vaccine against HIV began in South Africa on Wednesday, as scientists test a beefed-up version of the only shot ever to show a glimmer of protection.

Â€ÂœWe cannot separate viral hepatitis from HIV/AIDS- related problems because Indonesia is a country with an HIV epidemic that is concentrated in high-risk populations,Â€Â� Health Deputy Minister Ali Ghufron Mukti said in Jakarta on Thursday. He made the remarks during the opening of a national consultative meeting on hepatitis control in Indonesia held by the health ministry. It is estimated that 28 million people in Indonesia have been infected with hepatitis B and C. The 2007 Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) showed that the prevalence of hepatitis stood at 9.4 percent while hepatitis C at 2.1 percent. Unlike other types of hepatitis, which infect people mostly via fecal oral transmission, hepatitis B, C and D can infect patients via parenteral transmission, such as through sharing tools intended for personal use with hepatitis-infected people or through sexual intercourse. Administering the hepatitis B vaccine to newly born babies has been initiated since 1997 to prevent the illness. Although a vaccine for hepatitis C has yet to be developed, the illness can be cured. Â€ÂœHepatitis is an illness that can be prevented and cured,Â€Â� Ghufron said. Developing hepatitis B and C surveillance for high-risk populations is among initiatives the government is taking to prevent the spread of the illness.

According to Rahbeen, photographs, newspapers, various Quran manuscripts from the Durrani period, old currency as well as both original and copies of many important documents are displayed for visitors, particularly, the treaty signed between Afghanistan and the British Empire in 1919, under which, Afghanistan was given complete independence and another important letter, written by Timur, dating the 14th century. The building interior design with its beautiful painted ceiling and carved woodwork was as praiseworthy as the archiveâ€™s contents. Regionally known, the National Archive of Afghanistan also preserves some oldest historical manuscripts like the one dating the first AD century and a holy Quran manuscript ascribed to Ottoman and Ali the third and fourth Islamic caliphs, said Rahbeen. â€œAmong the contracts signed with China is a regionally valid agriculture scheme [Parwan Water-Supply], irrigating wide areas in the province; north of Kabul, the copy of which we received after approval by the countryâ€™s National Assembly,â€� the official added. Despite several decades of devastative civil war and trafficking of numerous ancient relics from Afghanistan to other world countries, the archive remained intact. â€œFortunately, the National Archive of Afghanistan, is the only government-run institution that remained intact and safe from any kind of robbery and larceny, during civil conflicts.â€� Ordinary people, researchers and students are not more often visiting the still-war-affected countryâ€™s archive and the institution yet to have any revenue. According to the official, usually more or less than 100 people; many of them students, visit the archive on a daily basis. Mr. Rahbeen who said has never been to China, even during his tenure as Director of the Afghanistan National Archive, expected to visit Chinese museums to know which documents about his country was there. Farsi [one of Afghanistan official languages] was spoken widely in Kashgar and Tibet even some itineraries narrate Farsi songs played in the Chinese ships, highlighting the two countries cultural relations and considering one of the most valid contracts signed with China in 1969, so, both Afghan and Chinese sides need to visit each other archives to get information about both sidesâ€™ cultural documents, said Rahbeen. The National Archive of Afghanistan is housed in own century building, located on the main road in Deh Afghanan, central Kabul. The structure was originally built by Amir Abdul Rahman Khan for his son and successor Amir Habibullah in 1892.

Based on remarks of minister of public health Ferozuddin Feroz, despite of various problems, considerable developments have been made towards improvement of health services delivery in Afghanistan. Health sector condition which was unacceptable before and during 2001 has considerably improved during the past 18 years, but there are still problems as present hospital and medical laboratories are not responding the peopleâ€™s needs; therefore, thousands of people prefer to go neighboring countries for further treatment of their diseases. Currently, increasing of various diseases incidents in Afghanistan has created problems to Afghans who are mostly suffering diseases that are easily curable in other countries and changed to somehow incurable diseases among Afghans. On the other hand, incidents of fatal diseases as cancer and HIV are increasing in the country. Thousands of people suffering such diseases have lost their life due to that the fact that they could not afford to pay for treatment of their diseases abroad Reports have shown that the people of Afghanistan spend more than $1 billion annually for health services delivery. Therefore, thousands of families due to dissatisfaction with quality of health services in Afghanistan prefer to visit Pakistan and India for treatment of their patients, showing low-quality of health services in the country. Tuberculosis: Tuberculosis is among infectious curable diseases that are treated in nearly 2,355 health centers in 34 provinces of the country where thousands of people unfortunately lose their life every year due to the disease in Afghanistan. Based on WHO statistics, every year 61,000 people get infected to this curable disease in Afghanistan and almost 12,000 of them lose their life due to lack of standard health services in the country. AIDS or HIV is also among fatal diseases the incidents of which are increasing in the country. Due to lack of standard health services, incidents of the disease are increasing year by year. Meanwhile, cancer is also among diseases whose incidents are increasing in the country. According to Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), 60 people suffering cancer are daily treated in cancer control center in the country. Based on WHO statistics, nearly 20,000 incidents of fatal cancer are diagnosed annually in Afghanistan where 15,000 of them lose their life due to lack of standard health services in the country. MoPH stresses that in consideration to predictions the number of people suffering to cancer is increasing by 50% in ten years. Lack of sufficient budget is considered as one of key challenges facing the countryâ€™s health sector. Currently, $5 is allocated annually to each person to receive health services. The amount is very less comparing to amount allocated for each person in other countries. In order to address current problems in health sector of the country, it is needed that further budget should be allocated for improvement of health sector in the country.

Recognized by the WHO as a global problem with serious consequence for mothers and their babies, anemia gives rise to complex interrelated issues affecting motherhood and childhood. The annual mortality rate for each of the 100,000-iron deficiency anemia in the 1990s was 46.8. Today anemia during pregnancy represents a global public health challenge increasingly faced by developing countries. Results Maternal anemia is associated with poor intrauterine growth and increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight rates. Consequently, it all results in higher perinatal morbidity and mortality, and higher infant mortality rates. Doubling of low birth weight and 2 to 3-fold increase in perinatal mortality rates. Anemia in pregnancy is considered as important contributor to maternal mortality or morbidity and low birth weight. The latter is likely to lead to increased infant mortality. The maximum and minimum prevalence of severe anemia affecting pregnant women is 20 and 2.7 percent. Directly or indirectly, anemia is responsible for 40 percent of maternal deaths. Methods The prevalence of anemia in South Asian countries is among the highest in the world. The WHO estimates that even among the South Asian countries India has the highest prevalence of anemia. We should emphasize that approximately half global maternal deaths due to anemia occur in South Asian countries. India contributes to about 80 percent of maternal deaths due to anemia in South Asia. It is obvious that Indiaâ€™s contribution to both the prevalence of anemia in pregnancy and maternal deaths due to anemia is higher than the guaranteed size of it. Conclusions Considered as the most frequent maternal complication of pregnancy, anemia has as following risk factors: â€“ compliance to iron and folic acid supplementation. â€“ deficiency of vitamin B12,low BMI â€“ infection with ascariasis, infections such as malaria, HIV, and hookworm infestation -deficient dietary consumption of foods fortified with iron, -other nutritional deficiencies, respectively. â€“ low socioeconomic conditions and high parity.

Head of the provinceâ€™s information and culture directorate Mukhtar Awrang told The Kabul Times his directorate is focused on three main sections, as beside press and information affairs, youth, culture and tourism sections have also done some positive works. In term of culture, the directorate has held many book reading, poem reading, Seerat-ul-Nabi and star competitions and they followed by good results. About star competitions he said, â€˜Earlier, in cooperation with Maidan Wardak information and culture and education departments, a mathematic competition was held among students. The competition was attended by 500 people including the provincial governor, heads of education and information and culture departments and a number of elites.â€™ He added six of the participants have been recognized as Maidan Wardak star in mathematics and 4000 afg along with certificates had been given to each winner. About book reading culture in Maidan Wardak he said, â€˜Majority of Maidan Wardak people are keen to read book and we have a library in downtown, where is always open to visitors.â€™ He stressed to grow book reading culture, a library is expected to be built in Wardakâ€™s Chack area, and its construction works would be completed in 1398. On women interest in book reading he said, â€˜Men are eager to read books in Maidan Wardak, but womenâ€™s interest to book reading is not visible, because, the provinceâ€™s information and culture department doesnâ€™t have a separate library for them. Thus, the provinceâ€™s information and culture department has planned to recruit a female in the library, so the women can freely visit the department and solve their problems.â€™ In term of press, he said his department had a weekly named Millie Hadaf â€˜National Goalâ€™ which publishes all events going on in that province. Besides, the provinceâ€™s historical and cultural monuments need repair and the provincial MoIC department could do much in the respect as well. Maidan Wardak is a province with 46 historical monuments, among which, 22 of them have been registered in the ministry of information and culture.

But we",Saida Ahmadi,"July 24, 2018",The Kabul Times,"CyArkâ€™s work has been so significant that in April, Google partnered with the company to launch the Open Heritage project, which allows people to experience the worldâ€™s great wondersâ€”both existing and ruined through a careful marriage of CyArkâ€™s 3D data and a Google-powered mobile or virtual reality headset. But we can go even further. The rubble of the Buddhas has now been scanned and printed at 1:25 scale. These small model statues are being used to plan the life-size restoration of the statues through 3D printing. It is an ambitious tech project, and we may be years, if not decades, away from achieving the ultimate goal of recreating these statues. There are other organizations doing similar, inspiring work. University of Oxford, Harvard University, and Dubaiâ€™s Museum of the Future have worked together to create the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA), which distributes 3D cameras to residents in areas attacked by ISIS so that ancient buildings and artifacts could be documented before they are lost to war forever. The Million Image Database project aims to document historic and archaeological locations all around the world, using 3D photography to capture dimensions and specifications. The data is archived so that artifacts and structures can be recreated through 3D printing in case of damage. The organization aims to collect one million 3D images of these endangered historic sites, and has already captured more than half a million images, thanks to the 5,000 3D cameras that have been distributed. In a project conducted by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, historians recreated a chair owned by Marie Antoinette using molds, 3D scanning, and 3D printing. By scanning the missing parts, they were then able to reverse 3D print them. The moldings taken from the 3D printed pieces were re-casted in a non-chemical material that was then toned and gilded so that it would match the original pieces. Many of such items were stolen or destroyed following the French Revolution. With technology and innovation, powered by the rise of 3D scanning and printing, all things are possible. Quite soon, in fact, 3D printing will allow us to take these stunning digital imprints and do more than view them through the filter of a hologram or virtual reality headset. Smaller versions, printed to scale on the home 3D printers that will soon exist in households across America, will offer endless opportunities for education and cultural enrichment. But the potential is much grander, as well. In the very near future, harnessing these digital libraries and the immense bandwidth offered by a giant like Google, we will also be able to fully recreate cherished heritage sites, using not just light and shadow, but actual brick, mortar, and 3D-printed concrete. The Buddhas of Bamiyan will rise again in that lush valley, not just as a beautiful light show for one night only, but as living, tangible proof of the resilience of human creativity in the face of senseless destruction. Just imagine if we do the same for the Temple of Bel in Palmyra; the libraries at the University of Mosul; and the Armenian Genocide Memorial in Syria. Itâ€™s no longer a far-off dream. The technology is ready. With the wonders of 3D, weâ€™ve found a new way to fight for the preservation of our cultural and spiritual monuments, powered by brainpower and the collective will of humanity.

Mumbai's civic hospital doctors operate on HIV-TB patient,"MUMBAI: In a rare feat in a public hospital, a 50-year-old patient with dual infection of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV was operated a.",Tnn,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: In a rare feat in a public hospital, a 50-year-old patient with dual infection of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV was operated at civic-run TB Hospital in Sewri on Friday. HIV and TB, both highly infectious, need special arrangements and the use of extra disposable material that add to the cost of surgery in the private sector. This is the second time a patient with HIV and TB was operated at the hospital. Our honorary surgeons regularly operate on TB patients, but such a supra-major surgery is rare, said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent of the hospital. Surgery on the earlier co-infection patient was done over three years back. The present patient, on anti-retroviral therapy for HIV\AIDS since 2009, was diagnosed with multi-drug resistant TB in October 2018. He came with severe breathing difficulty about 10 days back, said Dr Anande. Doctors realized the TB infection affected his respiratory system so severely that only an operation could provide immediate relief. The surgical team performed decortication, a medical procedure involving surgical removal of the surface layer covering of an organ. The procedure is usually performed when the lung is covered by a thick, inelastic pleural peel restricting lung expansion. The lungs are covered by a thin membrane called pleura that is thinner than tissue paper. The TB infection makes this pleura thicker, said cardiothroracic and vascular surgeon Dr Amol Bhanushali, who was in the team that operated on the patient. Dr Amol Bhanusali said the patients pleura had became thick with consistency of curd, preventing the lungs from expanding during breathing. It took us three hours to open up his chest and remove the pleura, he added. The patients lungs were not severely affected by the TB bacterium and medicines should now help him recover. The patient is recovering and had his meals on Monday but as his immune system is weak, he will need 15 more days of hospitalization, said Dr Anande. TB activist Ganesh Acharya said this was a positive development as many patients with HIV-MDR TB co-infection find it difficult to access healthcare. Surgery is an option for patients in whom recovery with drugs alone is not possible. The government must provide modern operating theatres so doctors can operate on such patients safely, he added.

Pakistan police arrest doctor after 90 infected by HIV syringe,"Pakistan News: At least 90 people, including 65 children, are believed to have been infected with the HIV virus in Pakistan by a doctor using a contaminated syringe.",Afp,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"KARACHI: At least 90 people, including 65 children, are believed to have been infected with the HIV virus in Pakistan by a doctor using a contaminated syringe, officials said Friday. ""We have arrested a doctor after receiving complaints from the health authorities,"" said Kamran Nawaz, the local police chief heading the case in the southern city of Larkana. ""We are told that the doctor also has HIV,"" he said. Authorities were first alerted last week after 18 children from a town on the outskirts of the city tested positive for the virus, which causes AIDS, prompting health officials to carry out wider screenings. Dozens more infections were found. ""More than 90 people have tested HIV positive and the number of children is around 65,"" Dr Abdul Rehaman, a district health official in Larkana, told AFP. A second official confirmed the outbreak, although gave slightly different figures. Authorities said they traced the outbreak to a single doctor, who appears to have been using a contaminated syringe on patients. Azra Pechuho, Sindh province's health minister, confirmed his arrest. ""The blood of the parents of the infected children was also tested, but their results were negative,"" Pechuho added. Officials have since launched an even larger testing and education drive. Pakistan is considered a low prevalence country for HIV, but the disease is expanding  mostly among intravenous drug users, sex workers and migrant labourers returning from the Gulf.

""I am of the view that the punishment of imprisonment has to be modified due to the nature of the disease and the sufferings of the petitioner on humanitarian ground,"" Justice M V Muralidharan said, while setting aside the imprisonment orders by a sessions court. The judge then imposed 5,000 as penalty to be paid by the petitioner. The petitioner was working as secretary-in-charge of the Primary Agricultural Co-operative Bank in 1991. Alleging that during his tenure he misappropriated funds to the tune of several lakhs, two separate cases were registered against him. Concluding the trial, the magistrates concerned convicted him for the offences and sentenced him to undergo one year imprisonment in each case. Challenging the order, the petitioner moved an appeal before the district sessions court. He requested the court to consider his plea as he was diagnosed as HIV+ and that his days were numbered. Considering the same, the sessions court reduced the sentence to one month. Aggrieved, the petitioner moved the high court. As the prosecution did not dispute the fact that the petitioner has been found to be HIV+, Justice Muralidaran allowed the appeal and set aside the sentencing in both the cases.

"Accused of injecting wife with HIV, Pune doctor attempts suicide","PUNE: A medical practitioner attempted suicide on Friday night by consuming poison, months after his wife lodged a complaint accusing him of injecting.",Tnn,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"PUNE: A medical practitioner attempted suicide on Friday night by consuming poison, months after his wife lodged a complaint accusing him of injecting deadly Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in her for securing divorce. An officer from the Wakad police said the homeopath was being treated and was out of danger. We suspect he attempted suicide following frustration, the officer said. The doctor was arrested in December last year after his wife had lodged an FIR against him alleging he injected HIV into her body to obtain divorce. He was released on bail. The womans medical reports showed she was infected with HIV from January 2018. The woman also alleged that her husband and in-laws were harassing her for money to start business after her marriage in 2015. She claimed that her husband administered her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for divorce. The police have not filed a chargesheet in the case yet because they are yet to get a confirmation from experts on if the HIV was transmitted to the woman through the infected blood.

Transfusion of HIV blood: Panel seeks time till January 9 to give report,CHENNAI: After two lab technicians failed to turn up before the committee appointed by the health department to probe the case of pregnant women given.,Tnn,16-05-2019,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: After two lab technicians failed to turn up before the committee appointed by the health department to probe the case of pregnant women given HIV-infected blood, the panel has sought for an extension till January 9 to submit to its report. On December 26, health secretary J Radhakrishnan issued a government order asking a six-member committee under the chairmanship of additional director of medical services Dr S Madhavi to inquire into the case and submit a report in a week. The panel, comprised of senior doctors including Madras Medical College professor of internal medicine Dr S Raghunandhan, Tirunelveli Medical College professor of blood transfusion Dr S A Manimala and Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University associate professor Dr Swathandran Hamsawardhini, began its probe on December 28 The team, however, could not complete the inquiry on time as two lab technicians failed to depose before the committee. It is not binding on them to appear before the committee. So, we cannot bring them by force. But we wanted to give them a chance to give their version, a member of the committee said. Preliminary inquiries conducted by a team led by Virudhunagar joint director (health) Dr Manohar found that officials at the blood bank and HIV/AIDS counsellors had erred at least twice before they transfused the HIV-infected blood to the woman. In 2016, the donor had given blood at a camp in Sattur in Virudhunagar district. The government hospital there tested the sample positive for HIV but the counsellor at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre failed to inform the donor of his status. When he gave blood a second time in November, the blood was issued to a pregnant woman in Sivakasi. The testing kit used by the PHC is reliable and is supplied by NACO for centres across India. So far, it does not look like a machine error. We want the technicians to tell us what went wrong, said a senior doctor.

The committee headed by NCPCR member Dr RG Anand also visited the child while she availed treatment at the Tirupur Government Hospital on Thursday. The district administration will soon submit a report on the condition of the child and the financial status of her family.

Though the parents were asked to visit CMCH, as the commission wanted to meet them, they refused to go there. As the girl was ill, the parents took her to the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Center at the Tirupur Government Hospital on Wednesday. After conducting inquiries with CMCH authorities, the committee including Aravind of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) visited Tirupur GH. They met the girls mother at the general in-patient ward, where the girl was admitted, before having conversations with the hospital resident medical officer and superintendent. They wanted to understand about the condition of the girl and the financial condition of her family. NCPCR was pondering whether to provide any financial assistance to the family. Since the girls father was not present, they could not complete the inquiry, district child protection officer D Vasanth Kumar said. Meanwhile, the district administration will submit a report on the child to the state government soon. It is also planning to provide counselling to the family on HIV. The commission assured financial assistance to the family, the girls 27-year-old father, who works in a powerloom unit at Palladam taluk, told TOI.

The couple, who reside in Palladam taluk in Tirupur, don't want to take their child to the CMCH again. ""I firmly suspect that the blood transfused to our daughter at CMCH on July 12, 2018, is the source of infection. If the blood was uninfected, why did doctors remove it when not even half of it was transfused,"" the 27-year-old father of the victim said. ""After doctors confirmed the HIV infection on February 7, we took up the issue with CMCH dean Dr B Asokan, but he refuted our claims. So, we tried to lodge a complaint with the Race Course police. But police refused to take up the case saying the issue cannot be solved in police station,"" he said. ""The doctors were, however, preparing to discharge our child saying the disease could be cured. We urged them to provide treatment at the hospital itself. The baby was given medicines. On February 21, we discontinued the treatment fearing backlash as the issue was escalating. We left the hospital without informing the doctors,"" he said. The powerloom worker, who earns 10,000 a month, said, ""We do not want to go back to CMCH.

Gujarat fifth in HIV deaths in country,"AHMEDABAD: In the last three years, Gujarat saw an increase in Aids deaths, already raising alarm bells for the state government.",Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: In the last three years, Gujarat saw an increase in Aids deaths, already raising alarm bells for the state government. The state has the fifth highest deaths due to HIV infections in the country. In the last three financial years ending in 2017-18, Gujarat saw 8,086 deaths due to HIV or Aids; of these 2,819 died in 2017-18. In 2016-17 the state saw 2,640 HIV related deaths and in 2015-16 the previous year Gujarat saw 2,627 deaths due to the deadly disease. In its 2017 report, NACO had claimed that new pockets of infection had emerged in states like Gujarat, Bihar, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Odisha, and Jharkhand which needed close monitoring and tailored prevention and treatment programmes. The report also pointed out that the transmission dynamics between states caused by migration should be studied and should be recognised as a key driver of new HIV infections. Interestingly, against the rising number of HIV deaths the central allocation for Aids control has decreased for Gujarat. In 2015 the state was allocated Rs 5,674 cr which reduced to Rs 5,271 cr in 2017-18. The other states that have recorded high deaths due to Aids are Maharashtra with 10,061 deaths in 2017-18, in the same period Karnataka registered 8,126 deaths Tamil Nadu saw 4,314 deaths and UP, one of the largest states in the country witnessed 3,723 deaths. The figures were placed in the Lok Sabha Union minister of state for health Anupriya Patel recently. We have intensified our outreach programmes for HIV awareness among hig risk groups in the state, says a senior state health official. he adds, One of the problems we are grappling with now is the increasing migratory population.

Madurai: Woman injected with HIV+ blood now faces social stigma,MADURAI: The woman who was infected with HIV virus unintentionally and her husband fear the social stigma more than the disease itself.,Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The woman who was infected with HIV virus unintentionally and her husband fear the social stigma more than the disease itself. This is something the Madurai Network of Positive People (MNP+) says will be more difficult to deal with even though the infection was a result of transfusion. Her 27-year-old husband from Sattur said even his closest friends were standing several feet away when they came to see him. I dont blame them, he said. Woman who was given HIV+ blood gives birth to girlHe said he had refused to accept the two cents of land allocated by the government as compensation for the distress caused to them as it was situated about 15 kilometres from their present residence in Sattur. It is as if they had given us a secluded godforsaken place where others wouldnt interfere, but I want a place within the town though I can already see that we are going to be stigmatized, he said. HIV+ donor who infected woman tries to kill selfMNP+ president B V Babu, said there were 2,000 people in their positive living group almost all of who still experienced problems after coming out in the open about their HIV status. NACO (National AIDS Control Organization) went for care and support in the year 2012 though the issue of social stigma was not addressed properly. Now, no awareness is being created and it is getting worse, he said. Just a handful of people with HIV were working in public sector establishments and private offices. Otherwise, all of them were self-employed as other people in society were not ready to accept them as one of their own. I have a small agricultural farm, but even there I must listen to comments from the others in the village which can be hurtful, Babu said. When such people apply for the 1,000 monthly dole given by the government for their welfare, the revenue officials make inquiries in the neighbourhood. Thus, they come to know that they have an HIV/AIDS person in their midst and the discrimination starts there, he said. HIV positive people were also given priority in schemes like green houses but as verification was conducted to check this status, there had been cases of the neighbours becoming hostile and not allowing their children to play with their children, said Babu. R Kannan, secretary of the group, says that a former Madurai district collector asked them to stop distributing water from a can at the Government Rajaji Hospital in 2012 because people objected to it. Even the staff who work in the HIV/AIDS section in hospital consider it to be a demeaning job. So, how are they going to make the society see us in a better light? he said.

The woman, who got infected with HIV virus after she was given HIV positive blood on December 3 last year, had been under supervision and care of a special team of doctors in the Government Rajaji Hospital here since December 27, said hospital dean in-charge Dr S Shanmugasundaram. The woman went into labour and gave birth to the girl around 7pm on Thursday. The dean said the baby, weighing 1.75kg, was doing well and no birth defect had been noted. The mother was also doing well, he added. The infant was given nevirapine syrup to prevent HIV infection and immunoglobulin to prevent hepatitis B infection. As the baby was underweight, it has been kept in the warmer and will be given formula feed till it gains the desirable weight, the dean said. An HIV-infected mother cannot feed her baby for fear of transmitting the infection. HIV screening of the baby would be done only after 45 days, after which it would be known if the child was born with or without the infection, Shanmugasundaram added. On December 3, blood donated by an HIV-positive teenager was given to the woman when she was admitted to Sattur government hospital. The teenager donated blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realising that he was HIV infected. The teenager committed suicide after learning about his health condition.

Health Minister C Vijayabaskar, replying to a calling attention motion on the issue in the state assembly, said three lab technicians had already been terminated for the lapse at the blood bank that led to transfusion of the blood donated by a 19-year-old man last month.

HIV +ve Tamil Nadu teen who attempted suicide diesVijayabaskar, who described the incident as shocking, said a panel led by the Additional Director of Medical Services was looking into the issue to pinpoint where the lapse occurred in certifying the blood safe and assured appropriate action after the inquiry. The 24-year-old woman contracted HIV after the blood transfusion at a government hospital at Sattur in Virudhunagar distrit in the first week of December for treatment of haemoglobin deficiency. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation with opposition parties demanding the dismissal of the health minister and transfer of the state health secretary. The man, who attempted suicide after learning about the transfusion, died at a hospital on Sunday.

Autopsy performed on HIV+ve donorâ€™s body at GRH,MADURAI: Postmortem was performed on the body of the HIV-positive blood donor who died while undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital here o.,Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: Postmortem was performed on the body of the HIV-positive blood donor who died while undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital here on Sunday, a few days after consuming poison. Hospital dean in-charge Dr S Shanmugasundaram said the postmortem was performed by a team of doctors led by Dr Selvaraj, head of the department of forensic medicine in Madurai Medical College, Dr Juliana, also from the college, and Dr Arunkumar and Dr R Chandrasekar from Theni Government MCH. The process was videographed as directed by the Madurai bench of the Madras high court and the body handed over to his parents. The postmortem, which was supposed to begin by 10am, was delayed following confusion over the high court direction. It began in the afternoon after the court clarified that two associate professors from Theni Government Medical College Hospital could assist the doctors here. The victims counsel pointed out that both doctors were taken from Theni while the court, on December 31, had directed that two assistant professors from either Theni or Sivaganga or Tirunelveli could participate in the postmortem. On Wednesday, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that since the postmortem would be videographed, there need not be any concern and gave the go-ahead. Earlier, on December 31, a special hearing was presided over by Justice Pugalendhi after the teenagers family moved the high court seeking postmortem of his body by two external doctors under video coverage. The court granted the relief sought by the family and also directed to videograph the postmortem. The teenager died on Sunday morning, a few days after consuming rat poison on Wednesday. The teenagers family members expressed suspicion over his death as he was a crucial witness in the case. They said the doctors in GRH, where he had been undergoing treatment after his suicide attempt, had hidden details from the family. The teenager, who had been working in a fireworks unit in Sivakasi, donated blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realising that he was HIV-infected. This blood was transfused to a 23-year-old pregnant woman on December 3 last year.

Another woman says she got HIV from donor blood,"CHENNAI: Two days after reports about HIV-infected blood being transfused into a pregnant woman, a Chennai-based woman said she too has acquired the v.",Tnn,22-01-2019,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: Two days after reports about HIV-infected blood being transfused into a pregnant woman, a Chennai-based woman said she too has acquired the viral infection after undergoing treatment at the government-run Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH). The woman, who gave birth to a boy on September 15, told reporters that she tested positive after she was administered two units of blood at the hospital in April. Hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P rejected the claim. As per medical records, the woman visited a primary health centre in Mangadu on March 6 when doctors confirmed her pregnancy. In April, doctors referred her to KMCH for blood transfusion after they found her haemoglobin level was low. The report of a blood test she did at a private hospital on February 12 shows HIV negative. At KMCH she was given two units of blood on April 5 and April 6, and she got discharged 10 days later. She was referred back to the hospital in August after scans showed the fetus was in breech position (legs down). Thats when the hospital ordered the HIV test. Usually we assign a number along with every HIV test done. Her records did not have the number. So we repeated the test and she tested positive. We started her on medication and help her deliver a healthy baby in September, said hospital dean Dr Vasanthamani P. The woman said she was forced to remain silent as she feared that she would be ostracized by her family and friends. But she petitioned health minister C Vijaya Baskar, health secretary J Radhakrishnan and other senior administrators. I did not receive any call from the government. When I read about how another pregnant woman acquired the infection, I decided to talk about my condition, she said. My husband has no infection. This hospital is the only possible source of infection, she said. Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe said the government ordered for an inquiry in December. Today, the inquires revealed said the blood provided by the hospital was tested safe, he said. The two units of blood (1962 and 2129) administered to the woman were labelled safe after they were screened on high-end equipment. While one of the blood samples were sourced from a college student, the other was a regular voluntary blood donor. We have a machine printed copy that says the samples were safe, said Dr Vasanthamani. It is difficult for us to point out the infection source now, she said. Health activists and NGOs say the state health department should do a more detailed inquiry to clear its name. It is important for the hospitals to recall the donors for a HIV test. If they test negative, it is evident that the disease was not transfused through blood. What if the test was false negative because they were in their window period, said Karunanidhi, who works for a positive network NGO. Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society project director K Senthil Raj said the state has not dropped its guard on blood screening. We have a robost screening programme. At least 60% of deliveries happen in GH. There is no need for women to panic, he said.

Manoharan was informed and there was an immediate search for the donated blood, which they found had been transfused to the pregnant woman. The woman was summoned to the hospital and tests which showed that she had been infected with HIV. It has now come to light that the Sattur government hospital had first found the donor HIV positive in 2016 during a blood donation camp. Instead of conveying it to him directly, he was told he had a rare blood group and was asked to come to the hospital. ""It should no have happened. We have initiated technical inquiries to find out how it happened. This will not be repeated again.

Joint director of health services, Virudhunagar, R Manoharan told PTI the woman was admitted to a private hospital in Sattur for the birth of her second child and the doctors advised her to have a blood transfusion citing haemoglobin deficiency. Blood brought from the blood bank was transfused to her. It later emerged that the donor was HIV positive, the official said, adding the recipient's blood was also tested, which confirmed that she too had got infected by the virus. Preliminary inquiry revealed that the blood bank staff had failed to screen the blood properly before supplying it to the private hospital. The personnel who tested the donor's blood had labelled it 'safe,' officials said. A detailed medical treatment is also underway for the woman to ensure the virus does not affect her foetus, the minister said, adding, the government is also giving all livelihood assistance to the family. Lakhs of persons were provided with blood component annually including in the form of blood and ""there have been no complaints (of such nature) so far and this is the first time which is shocking,"" he told reporters in Chennai.

Observing that the premier institution delivered inadequate services thereby causing mental trauma to the complainant, the court ordered that the amount be paid within a month. Naseem Ali, the complainant, who is a resident of Bhagwanpur in Haridwar district, had visited a private hospital in Roorkee for first-aid after suffering an injury on July 12, 2014. There he found that his blood was not clotting properly, following which he was immediately admitted to the hospital. After three days of treatment, he was referred to AIIMS Rishikesh. At AIIMS, tests were conducted and he was told that he was HIV positive. However, when his health deteriorated, his family took him to Shri Mahant Indiresh Hospital where he was detected as HIV negative on July 28. In January 2015, Ali registered a complaint with the district consumer forum against Roorkee-based Dr BS Saini Kalawati Hospital, AIIMS Rishikesh and United India Insurance company. Observing carelessness in treatment on part of AIIMS Rishikesh, the consumer forum accepted the case and last month slapped a penalty of Rs 50,000 and an additional Rs 10,000 on the institution for wasting the complainants time and energy. The order, which was issued on April 22, reads, Ensure payment of Rs 50,000 and Rs 10,000 within one month for incorrect treatment. And in case the amount is not paid within a month, then you will be liable to pay this amount at 6% annual interest. Read this story in BengaliSK Bhama, an advocate who was involved in the case, told TOI, The court observed that the test result caused mental trauma and social problems to the man. Meanwhile, Dr Manoj Gupta, a spokesperson of AIIMS Rishikesh, said that the institution will appeal against the judgement in a higher court.

Activists oppose Johnson & Johnson drug donation,Bedaquiline (BDQ) is one of the latest drugs used to treat drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB).India has the highest burden of drug-resistant TB,Tnn,08-05-2019,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: Health activists have written to the Union health ministry pointing out a ""conflict of interest"" created over its acceptance of donations of the drug Bedaquiline from pharma major Johnson & Johnson (J&J) while it faces an inquiry for supplying ""harmful medical devices"" to Indian patients. Bedaquiline (BDQ) is one of the latest drugs used to treat drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB). India has the highest burden of drug-resistant TB and is home to over a quarter of the world's TB patients. ""J&J had previously donated 10,000 courses of BDQ to India's TB programme in 2016, as part of a global donation programme operated in partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID),"" said the letter addressed to minister of state for health, Ashwani Choubey, and to secretary Preeti Sudan. It was signed by NGO All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) as well as several activists working in the field of TB & HIV. Mumbai-based TB activist Ganesh Acharya, who is one of the signatories of the letter, said that the new donation comes three years later in the backdrop of multiple regulatory actions and investigations by the health ministry into harmful medical devices and cosmetic products marketed by J&J in India. The activists believe the donation threatens the sustainability of the government's MDR-TB treatment programme. Moreover, it seems to be aimed at extracting concessions or leniency from the government, added Acharya. The activists said this drug donation would not only create dependence on donations from a single supplier, but also stifle the government's willingness to promote local production of the drug by generic manufacturers to ensure affordable and sustainable supply to the government TB control programme.

Shortage of the medicine had left pregnant women and new mothers living with HIV, troubled. The city got the first batch of medicines on Wednesday afternoon. The state government had issued a notice saying the drug will not be available until the end of October sending HIV positive mothers into a panic. Nevirapine syrup is given to babies born from HIV positive mothers within 72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of contracting the disease from their mothers. The drug which was available at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers was out of stock. It was not available at private organizations as well. After a 20-day delay, the city on Wednesday received its first consignment of Nevirapine syrups. The essential drug was out of stock since the beginning of September. While NGOs were pulling out all stops to get the drug, new mothers and pregnant women were left wringing their hands and worried sick for their babies. People living with HIV were also deprived of combinations of Nevirapine. Speaking to TOI, district AIDS prevention officer Dr Ravi said taking note of the urgency and complaints from NGOs in the city, the state government dispatched Nevirapine syrups for infants. It is available at the ART centres and new mothers can avail it. Now there is adequate stock to cater to all pregnant and new mothers with HIV. Newborns are our priority, he stated. Chandrashekar, head of the city-based NGO Anandajyothi, said that he had written several mails to the authorities and health officers seeking supply of the essential drug. When NACO replied stating a three-month delay in the supply of Nevirapine, we were shocked. The drug is a necessity for newborns and pregnant women. The drug was available at ART centres but not in medical stores in the city. Since 20 days, people with HIV, parents of newborn would visit hospitals and go back crestfallen. New mothers were worried as it was the question of their childs health. Despite repeated requisitions, the medicine was delayed by 20 days, he added. According to statistics, the city currently has over a dozen HIV positive pregnant women. Nevirapine syrup is said to reduce the chances of a newborn acquiring the virus from the infected mother. It is given to babies within 24 hours of birth up till 45 days. What is Nevirapine? Nevirapine is a prescription medicine for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and children. It is said to prevent postnatal HIV infection. Nevirapine is always used in combination with other HIV medicines. - (By Akshatha J) Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

Every year, World Aids Day on December 1 is marked with awareness programmes across the country but a lot remains to be done for the prevention and control of this deadly disease. The Punjab government should launch an aggressive campaign for educating the sections of society that are most vulnerable to contracting Aids. This includes truck drivers, drug addicts, sex workers, and pregnant women. For the treatment of infected people, integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) need to work in tandem with the health department of the state. The centres should stock necessary medicines for the treatment of this disease. Psychological treatment of the patients is also important and required to be done in a big way.

She had to undergo surgery for getting her uterus removed. She repeatedly tried to get the operation done at a government-run hospital. Since she was HIV/AIDS positive, doctors did not perform the surgery on her. Finally, she died of the disease. Thirty-five-year-old Seema (name changed), a resident of Bassi area, who was diagnosed with HIV, was married to a person, who was already married. Her husband did not reveal to her that he was a married man. At the time of marriage, her husband was living with HIV/AIDS. I also got infected with HIV after the marriage. I got this virus from my husband. My husband already had four kids from his first wife, said Seema. My husband died about six years ago and after that, my in-laws threw me out from my husbands house, she said, adding that after the intervention of Rajasthan State Commission for Women, her in-laws provided her a hut made for cattle.

The team was lead by Dr Gaurav Gaur, assistant professor, Centre for Social Work, Panjab University. All these children have contracted HIV/AIDS from their parents. Some of them have even lost their fathers to HIV and now are being brought up by their mothers alone. Despite all odds, these great mothers  who are simultaneously facing stigma and discrimination from their families and outsiders too  are fending for their children and working hard for their education, even with little or no recurring financial support, said Gaur. Sharing the experience, NSS volunteer Ishita Choudhary said these children were provided with stationary items like registers, copies, pens, bags, pencils and colour boxes etc. to encourage them to do better. They were also given health kits which included toothbrush, toothpaste, soap cakes and healthy refreshments. She said it was a learning experience and the small gesture brought smiles on the childrens faces. The parents and guardians were also given household items and ration. Gaur said all the items given to these children or to their parents and guardians were donated by various philanthropists.

"Took to crime to fund treatment, claims snatcher",NOIDA: A man arrested for snatching mobile phones has told police he took to crime to fund his treatment for HIV in a private hospital.,Tnn,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"NOIDA: A man arrested for snatching mobile phones has told police he took to crime to fund his treatment for HIV in a private hospital. The accused, from Bulandshahr, had been snatching phones in Kasna and Knowledge Park areas along with an accomplice for the past few days. A father of two children, the man claimed he came to know that he was HIV-positive three months ago but didnt inform his family. He was arrested from Kasna on Sunday evening along with an accomplice, Manoj Kumar. At least seven phones and a bike used in committing the crimes were recovered from them. Manoj told a news conference he was unaware of his associates ailment and it was, in fact, the latter who had inducted him into crime. He is a painter by profession and so is Manoj. We are not going into the depths of his claim as most accused try such tactics to claim innocence. We have produced them in court. Jail authorities can get his medical tests done and verify the claim, said Ajay Kumar, the SHO of Kasna police station. The accused has even given the name of a private hospital where, he claimed, he had been undergoing treatment. He told police he wasnt a hardened criminal but had started snatching phones only 15 days ago. They had been moving around on a bike without changing its number plate. In fact, the number plate was reversed so that the registration number is not visible to anyone, the officer said. A spokesperson for the private hospital said the claims could be verified by the medical records department. We have not been contacted yet, he said.

Not approaching politics as a star: Urmila Matondkar,"Lok Sabha Elections 2019 News: Urmila Matondkar, the star of 90s hit Hindi films like ""Rangeela"", ""Daud"" and ""Judaai"", is contesting the Lok Sabha elections but says she isn't appro",Pti,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"MUMBAI: Urmila Matondkar, the star of 90s hit Hindi films like ""Rangeela"", ""Daud"" and ""Judaai"", is contesting the Lok Sabha elections but says she isn't approaching politics as a star and would rather be known as people's representative. ""I am not approaching this whole thing as a star with my star image. I am trying to get to grassroot and connect to people. I know it is going to be difficult."" ""I want to generate confidence in them about me as their representative more than just another star coming in, waving and asking for votes. Because that is not the thought with which I have gotten into it,"" Urmila told PTI in an interview. Considering she is a known face, ask her if Bollywood celebrities can be vote pullers, pat comes the reply, ""I can't talk about others, it is not fair. Media generally likes to generalise things as it makes their life easy."" She will be contesting the election from Mumbai North constituency, a seat held by Govinda. Urmila, who has been campaigning and meeting the locals, says some of the major issues of the area are housing, water scarcity and sanitation. ""The most important issue is housing and it is too deep rooted for anyone to get a solution quickly. The slum redevelopment needs to be looked into. Water is another big issue, it is also deep rooted so overnight solution is not possible. Women's health, local trains. But we need do to things."" ""This area is issue-ridden probably the most in Mumbai. People have been telling me about need for public toilets, water in Gorai area is another problem. Also (need for more) local trains as the population is more here and there is no infrastructure."" She is fighting against BJP's Gopal Shetty, a seasoned politician who has called Urmila naive and zero in politics. But the actor isn't affected. ""That shows his mentality in the whole thing. He started saying that this is going to be a battle of vichardhara (ideology) but non-stop he is speaking derogatory things about me, which I have never done.I think there can be two things behind it - someone who is not very confident and all these things stem out of deep rooted fear that must have come in."" The actor said the kind of politics he and his party indulge in focuses more on ""emotional battles"", keeping people occupied with ""all kinds of emotional, religious and socio-economic issues."" ""So that they do not come to main issues like what is progress? And where is the progress? ""If that is the politics he is referring to, I am happy to be political zero. For me politics is giving your word, standing by it and abiding by it no matter what."" The 45-year-old actor, who was last seen in a special appearance in Irrfan Khan's ""Blackmail"", felt it was time for her to do something for the society. ""I was against contesting the elections. I was interested in joining another party and wanted to campaign for whoever they wanted me to. They were interested that I contest the election and when you join a party you go with the decision the party makes and stand by it and give it your best."" According to Urmila, the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is going to be a ""very deciding election for the country"". Since her childhood, the actor says she was socially responsible and has been working towards issues related to women, children's education, AIDS awareness among others. Talking about Rahul Gandh as a Prime Ministerial candidate, Urmila believes he will be a ""phenomenal"" Prime Minister. ""He is a person, who is constantly trolled and degraded for the last five years but has worked non-stop without stooping to any such levels that the opposition constantly has like trolling and criticising on wrong issues. ""He has gone to grassroot level tried to understand the problem of people. The outcome of all that is the Congress manifesto, which is remarkable achievement."" She further says Gandhi has utilised the time to build the party and take the nation somewhere up without being in power. ""If he comes in power he will be capable of delivering it well,"" she adds. There have been celebrities who are dabbling into both, politics and acting, but Urmila intends to focus only on her political career at the moment. ""As of now I don't see any film thing happening. This is something so huge and challenging. It has been extremely challenging because I was prepared coming from a line of film industry to be criticised and not given your due or to be looked down up but to be ridiculed and trolled completely that all is a lot and that is a separate thing. ""It is a huge challenging career so I think it is already taking lot of time. I don't see the film bit happening."" Ask her about the issues faced by the industry and Urmila says, their issues are ""same as that of normal people."" ""The fact that our freedom of speech or freedom of any sort has come under tremendous danger. Here is the issue that everybody is facing be it media or film industry or common man.""

"Aurangabad woman claims she is HIV+, staves off rape",AURANGABAD: A murder accused out on bail tried to rape a 29-year-old widow near a nullah at Rajnagar but she thwarted the attempt by claiming to be HI.,Tnn,01-12-2018,The Times of India,"AURANGABAD: A murder accused out on bail tried to rape a 29-year-old widow near a nullah at Rajnagar but she thwarted the attempt by claiming to be HIV positive. Fearing he would be infected, the man left the place but was arrested by the police a couple of days ago. The man, Kishore Vilas Avhad (22), a resident of Rajnagar in the Mukundwadi area, had been arrested earlier for murdering his father. On the night of March 25, the woman, a resident of MIDC Waluj, had come to the city to shop with her seven-year-old daughter. While wanting to return home, she realised that she had only Rs 10 with her. She tried in vain to get seat-sharing autorickshaws to drop her and her daughter. She then stood outside the Shahnoormiya dargah asking for a lift. Avhad, who happened to be passing by on his motorcycle, offered to drop the woman and her daughter home. However, he rode to the nullah at Rajnagar instead. He threatened the woman with a sharp weapon and attempted to rape her. However, the woman showed great presence of mind by claiming to be HIV positive, following which Avhad left the spot. Assistant inspector Shraddha Waydande said the woman contacted the police and an offence for kidnapping and molestation was registered against Avhad, who had not been identified till then. The police also slapped sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act against him. Waydande said that based on the information provided by the woman, a sketch of the accused was prepared. The woman also told the police about the marks and tattoos on the accuseds hand. Using the description, we managed to arrest Avhad a couple of days ago, she said.

According to hospital officials, both were keeping good health and have been discharged considering that the mother is set to join her new job at District Aids Protection Control Unit (DAPCU) in Virudhunagar on Friday. The hospital officials said antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug nevirapine  given to prevent HIV transmission  would be given for the baby, apart from an antibiotic everyday as a form of continued treatment. The woman has also been asked to take two medicines everyday. Both are fine now, but we have asked them to come for a review in about a week, GRH dean Dr K Vanitha said. Though offered a job at DAPCU, the woman had initially refused a society-based job and sought a permanent job. Officials from the health department said all steps were being taken to fulfil her wish. A permanent government job would be offered to her very soon and in the meantime, for her livelihood support we have offered her the job at DAPCU based on her qualification, project director of Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society K Senthil Raj said.

Over 100 HIV patients brought back to ART,"Kolhapur: Over 100 HIV patients in the city and the district have been brought back to the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), officials from the District A.",Updated,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"Kolhapur: Over 100 HIV patients in the city and the district have been brought back to the Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), officials from the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) said. After an awareness campaign was conducted in the district, it was found that about 600 patients who were earlier treated under ART had opted out. Many were traced and offered counselling, and several are not opting to return to treatment. Officials said ART is absolutely necessary for those testing positive for HIV. It offers resistance against infection. However, the absolute necessity of the treatment is often not entirely understood by those most in need of it. Asked why patients might be opting out, the official said one reason could be the sheer strain of finances. There are also side-effects of ART when treatment first begins. Patients might find it a drain on their resources to just arrive at the hospital, especially if their homes are in rural areas. People also do not like to disclose their HIV-positive status, and getting regular treatment puts them at the risk of getting found out as being HIV-positive. Four hospitals in the district are equipped to offer ART. A city-based private hospital too has been included for such treatment, so there are in all five centres in the district offering this treatment. Patients are counselled at integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) before being put on treatment. After performing different blood tests, a patient whose CD4 count is less than 500 has to take treatment throughout his life. That norm, however, has now been relaxed. CD4 count is an indicator of how well the bodys immune system is working.Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer at DAPCU, said that as part of the awareness campaign, slum areas in the city are monitored and patients screening conducted.Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

While the son claimed doctors had suspended treatment after learning that she was HIV positive, hospital authorities denied the charge and said the treatment had got prolonged due to other health issues of the woman. The patient, a Beliaghata resident, was admitted to Unit-V of the orthopaedic surgery department on October 5 after she fell down at her home. All investigations prior to the surgery were done. But the doctors stopped her treatment after they came to know about her HIV status. They do not want to take up the surgery, alleged one of her sons. The hospital refuted the allegations and said the patient was being tended to with conservative treatment. According to the doctors, the patient needs hip replacement surgery that must be done under anesthesia. But the patient has other health issues, including chest ailment and psychiatric problems. We have to wait for anaesthesia clearance due to these conditions, a doctor said. The allegations are baseless. We conduct surgeries on HIV-positive patients on regular basis. So why we would we deny medical care to this particular patient. The reasons for the delay in the surgery are technical and has nothing to do with her being HIV positive, said Dr Dwipayan Biswas, deputy medical superintendent at NRSMCH. The patients family had lodged a formal complaint on October 12 with the hospital authority. The hospital administration claimed that the family was explained about the delay in taking up the surgery. My mother is lying on a hospital bed without any treatment. Doctors have told us to take her back home after they came to know that she is HIV status positive, alleged her elder son.

During the previous hearing, a division bench of justice N Kirubakaran and justice S S Sundar observed that the husband needed counselling. The judges had also stated that as the victims husband was not taking care of her and is not showing interest to live with her, it is appropriate for the state government to provide a house, a permanent government job for her educational qualification, continue the medical facilities till her life time and compensation for the mental agony, pain, suffering in a fixed deposit for her to withdraw the interest.

People with HIV speak out against discrimination,"PANAJI: Despite legislations and ample awareness about HIV/AIDs, people living with the disease continue to be stigmatised.",Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Despite legislations and ample awareness about HIV/AIDs, people living with the disease continue to be stigmatised. Similarly, transgenders face the highest level of discrimination. These were some of the issues discussed at a forum held in the city on Friday to mark Zero Discrimination Day. An initiative of NGO Human Touch Foundation the forum had seven speakers. People living with HIV (PLHIV) activist Celina DCosta, who discovered her HIV status shortly after her husband was detected with the disease, said she was thrown out of her husbands house. Her husband had died within three months of his status becoming clear. My mother-in-law locked toilets in the house as she and others feared they would get the disease if they shared the toilet with me. They didnt want me to be in the same house as they believed mosquito bites could also be a source of infection. 20 years later, she said, she is in a better placed and that level of discrimination doesnt exist any more, though it still exists. If there was zero discrimination, people would not have hesitated to reveal their HIV/AIDS status, she said Monika Shatriya, disability and gender rights activists, spoke about how transgenders are subjected to inhuman treatment. She said the legislation for transgenders is a half-hearted attempt. The proposed provision in the legislation for setting up a committee to certify the status of a transgender is not right, she said. Lawyer and human rights activist Adv Albertina Almeida said some of the legislations introduced to remove discrimination are yet to be implemented. Administrator at Fr Agnel College Fr Allan Tavares, talking about discrimination against transgenders, said Who are we to think they are abnormal and we are normal.

The CMO also about 40 to 50 women inmates were also screened during the camp and found to be free from any ailments. He said 300 inmates were yet to be examined by the health department. He said the HIV positive inmates would have to get their treatment card made from PGIMS, Rohtak, while the district health department would start their treatment in the jail. Earlier, the HIV positive patients had to go to the antiretroviral (ART) centre in the PGIMS for treatment but now the district health team started providing the facility to them in Jind. Our unit is now linked with the ART centre of the PGIMS, Dr Dahiya said. He said the department was concerned about the health of jail inmates and would continue conducting such checkups in future.

"CMCH not source of HIV infection for two-year-old child, says hospital dean",TIRUPUR: The Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) has submitted a report to the health department stating that the hospital was not the source o.,Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"TIRUPUR: The Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) has submitted a report to the health department stating that the hospital was not the source of HIV infection to a two-year-old girl from Tirupur district, as claimed by her parents. We have ascertained that a person who donated blood transfused to the child was not affected with HIV. We have record for the evidence. But it was not known where the child got infected with the virus, which can be transmitted with any needle prick. It was not easy to find the source of the infection, dean of CMCH Dr B Asokan said. The father of the child said, We again visited the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre at CMCH for medical check-up for our daughter on Monday. Paramedical staff tried to collect blood samples, as they said, for laboratory tests. But they could not draw enough quantity of blood as they wanted. He said, The CMCH has referred our daughter to ART centre in Tirupur government hospital. The hospital has provided a free bus pass to me so that I can take my daughter to Tirupur ART centre for checkup. The hospital authorities took my signature in an application to avail Rs 1,000 monthly assistance for my daughters treatment under the same scheme. An official associated with CMCHs ART centre said, We have made the girls parents understand that continuous medication and proper nutrition were only for her rehabilitation. There are different sorts of support given to the HIV-infected patients, based on their eligibility and need. In the best way, we are trying to support this girl child. Meanwhile, the national commission for protection of child rights conducted inquiry with parents at the hospital recently. Earlier, the parents did not visit the hospital for inquiry when they were asked to.

India sees major reductions in HIV infections: UN report,"India News: UNITED NATIONS: India saw a major reduction in the number of new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and people living with HIV from 2010 to 2017 on t.",Pti,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"UNITED NATIONS: India saw a major reduction in the number of new HIV infections, AIDS-related deaths and people living with HIV from 2010 to 2017 on the back of sustained and focussed efforts, according to a UN report which warned that the epidemic was growing in Pakistan. The Joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response. Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017. The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines. In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said. India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said. Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said. The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work. It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work. Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade. The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids. Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said. Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a ""sterling example"" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments. UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point. At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition. ""We are sounding the alarm"", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. ""Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,"" Sidibe said. Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted. Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020. In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said. The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming. Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs. ""The right to health for all is non-negotiable,"" said Sidibe. ""Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,"" Sidibe added.

"HIV case: Coimbatore hospital checks files, records","On Wednesday, doctors said the girl child, who weighed 700 grams at birth, has had several hospital admissions due to complications from congenital he",Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"COIMBATORE: Two days after a two-year-old child tested positive for HIV, doctors at the Coimbatore Medical College hospital are poring over case records, hospital data and doing intensive medical checks to find out the source of infection. The child's parents and twin have tested negative for HIV. Meanwhile, Coimbatore collector K Rajamani has ordered an independent inquiry, which is likely to run parallelly. On Wednesday, doctors said the girl child, who weighed 700 grams at birth, has had several hospital admissions due to complications from congenital heart diseases such as a hole in the heart. Preliminary inquiries revealed that she had spent more than five weeks in neo-natal care at the KAP Viswanathan Government Medical College in Tiruchi soon after birth. She was admitted to the Coimbatore government hospital with complications of heart disease twice in the past one year. ""Once we gave her blood transfusion but it was issued only after we tested it for the infection. It was clean. We are pulling out all case sheets, records of hospital or clinic visits,"" said hospital dean Dr B Ashokan. After seeing an injury mark on the head, the hospital had also asked the child's parents more about the barber who tonsured the child's head. HIV is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk from an infected person either through unsterilized medical equipment such as syringes or catheters, or blood from an infected person or through unsafe sex. Hospital blood bank officer Dr A Mangayarkarasi said the department has submitted ELISA reports that confirm the blood transfused to this child was safe.

Give LGBTI free gender transition services in government hospitals: Experts,"CHANDIGARH: In the absence of a national guideline on the management of transgender and intersex issues, the public health experts proposed that free .",Tnn,30-03-2019,The Times of India,"CHANDIGARH: In the absence of a national guideline on the management of transgender and intersex issues, the public health experts proposed that free or subsidised gender transition services for the community should be given in government hospitals after proper informed consent, at least in tertiary level government hospitals to begin with. This was proposed at the two-day national conference on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) that concluded on Sunday at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGI). The experts have come out with recommendations to be sent to the union ministry of health, ministry of social justice and empowerment, ICMR and MCI. ""Two years ago, the Indian Council of Medical Research had constituted a task force to develop such national guidelines. What happened to them, we have no idea,"" said Dr Venkatesan Chakrapani, DBT India Alliance senior fellow, department of community medicine, PGI. It was recommended that the surrogacy laws and policies on artificial reproductive technologies should consider the need of LGBTI people. The panelists proposed the need for a proper consent from trans youth and intersex people, before irreversible genital surgeries. There are some cancers which are common in the lesbian and gay population. But the awareness is low in such areas. ""Thus, overall, health-related research among LGBTI people need to move beyond HIV risk and comprehensively address a range of physical and mental health needs and social well-being,"" said Dr Chakrapani. The experts felt that the medical, nursing and paramedical curriculum need to provide correct information about LGBTI people. It has been recommended that continuous medical education programmes should be initiated by the Indian medical professional associations. ""We urge the medical council of India to review its recent competency based curriculum, which still contains certain inaccuracies regarding representation of LGBTI issues, including considering sodomy and lesbianism,which have been decriminalised by the Supreme Court of India as sexual offences,"" said Dr P V M Lakshmi, professor of epidemiology, department of community medicine, PGI.

"Treat HIV students with care, educationists get lesson",PANAJI: Heads of institutions and teachers have been urged to stop any discrimination of students living with HIV and maintain confidentiality.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Heads of institutions and teachers have been urged to stop any discrimination of students living with HIV and maintain confidentiality. Considering schools in the past have been found discriminating against children living with HIV, the sensitisation session for them also threw light on the medical and health aspects of children living with HIV and the stigma attached to it. The half-day sensitisation workshop Lets End HIV Stigma was held for nearly 50 teachers, principals and lecturers from Salcete and Mormugao talukas, with an aim of improving the mindsets and approach of educational institutions when dealing with children and adolescents living with HIV. Participants were urged to sensitise teachers and non-teaching staff in their educational institutions not to further stigmatise any children living with HIV and maintain confidentiality of their status. Stigma is still a factor for many children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, founder of Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges stated. The Goa State AIDS Control Society team, headed by Dr Chandrakant Parab, encouraged the participants not to discriminate against the children or anybody living with HIV, while the senior medical officer of the anti-retroviral therapy centre, Dr Wanda Viegas also educated the participants on the medical and health aspects of people living with HIV and why they need to adhere to regular treatment. She also cleared multiple doubts on the subject. Considering stigma is still a factor for many children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, interventions are still required to correct misconceptions that HIV can be transmitted via casual contact with children living with HIV, founder of Just Imagine, Harry Patel said during the programme. Borges called for introspection in relation to self-awareness, attitudes, values and beliefs and pointed out that these factors affect the HIV stigma and discrimination and stressed on their importance if the state has to achieve zero HIV discrimination by 2030.

HIV +ve man sentenced for life for raping daughter,"ALAPPUZHA: The Alappuzha additional district and sessions court judge, S H Panchapakesan, on Monday sentenced a 50-year-old HIV positive man for life .",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"ALAPPUZHA: The Alappuzha additional district and sessions court judge, S H Panchapakesan, on Monday sentenced a 50-year-old HIV positive man for life term for raping his daughter. The girl has also contracted the virus due to the abuse. As per the judgment, the life term shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life and the court has also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh under section 376(2) (f) of IPC on charges of rape. Apart from this, the accused was also sentenced for 10 years imprisonment and was slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh under another section. If failed to pay the fine, he should undergo simple imprisonment for two years under the section 376(2) (n) of IPC. The substantive portion of the sentence shall run concurrently, the judgment said. Additional public prosecutor C Vidhu said that it was an anganwadi worker who brought the incident to the light in 2013. The survivor revealed to the anganwadi worker when she was 19 years old that she had been raped by her father since her childhood. Following this, the anganwadi worker approached Kudumbashree Mission, who informed police. Police then registered a case and arrested the accused. The accused, who was working in Mumbai, was infected with HIV. His wife died of AIDS in October 2012. However, he continued to rape his daughter and she also became an HIV patient, said Vidhu. Considering the type of abuse, gravity of the offences and the severity of the mental or physical harm or injury suffered by the survivor; the expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on her medical treatment for physical and mental health; loss of educational opportunity, I am of the view that this is a fit case, in which, a reasonable compensation as scheduled in the Kerala Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014, can be awarded. As the accused is life convict suffering from HIV positive, there is seldom chance for the realization of the said fine amount from him. So the court here by makes a recommendation to the District Legal Service Authority, Alappuzha, for taking a judicious decision for the fixation of quantum of compensation to be awarded under the victim compensation scheme, the judgment said.

Earlier, it was only counselling and testing at the centre. ""People from the LGBTQ community can now access treatment in a safe space, and non-judgmental environment outside hospital settings,"" said Ashok Row Kavi, founder and chairperson of Humsafar Trust which started the clinic with Mumbai District AIDS Control Society and FHI 360.

"Kerala: Pre-marital sex leads to AIDS, says textbook",The biology textbook for Class X under the Kerala state syllabus has been giving a misleading information on AIDS for almost three years.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The biology textbook for Class X under the Kerala state syllabus has been giving a misleading information on AIDS for almost three years. A snippet from the textbook has now gone viral in social media following which the authorities have come under attack for spreading wrong information and not bothering to correct it all these years. In Chapter 4, titled 'Keeping diseases away', on page 60, pre-marital and extra marital sexual contact have been cited as the reasons for spread of AIDS. It was an open letter to education minister C Ravindranath by a higher secondary school teacher on Facebook which exposed the glaring mistake that was passed on to students in the form of AIDS awareness. Geetha N S, a botany teacher in a higher secondary school in Malappuram, posted on FB on February 24: ""My friend's daughter in Class X approached me to learn the subject. It was then that I noticed the blunder. When I asked my friends teaching in Class X, I understood it was being taught at least for the past three years,"" said Geetha, who is a botany teacher in a higher secondary school in Malappuram. Geetha said that Plus Two textbooks, on the other hand, clearly mentions that unsafe sex was one of the reasons for transmission of AIDS. The post was shared by several medical practitioners who raised the question on why the curriculum was silent on key topics such as safe sex even as it preached moral policing. Dr Arun N M, consultant of internal medicine and convener of HIV/AIDS cell of Indian Medical Association, Kerala, said those who prepared the textbook should have made it clear that one could get AIDS from having unprotected sex with a person who is infected with the virus. ""The statement in the text book stigmatizes a HIV patient as someone who cheats or is immoral. If a student has a HIV positive parents, imagine their trauma,"" he said. ""Those at counselling centres know that lot of women get infected from their husbands. More informed people should be roped in to provide content for such important topics,"" said Thiruvananthapuram-based doctor Veena J S. State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) director J Prasad said the blunder would be removed from the textbook from the next academic year. He, however, expressed surprise that nobody, including teachers, managed to spot the mistake and bring it to the notice of SCERT for so long.

Transfusion horror: Blood sample of baby sent for HIV test,MADURAI: The blood sample of the baby girl born to a woman who was transfused with HIV-positive blood at the government hospital (GH) at Sattur in Dec.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The blood sample of the baby girl born to a woman who was transfused with HIV-positive blood at the government hospital (GH) at Sattur in December last year when she was pregnant was sent for testing to a laboratory on Monday. The blood would undergo Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test to determine within 30 days whether the baby was born with HIV infection. When the baby was born at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on January 17, the doctors had said that screening for HIV could be done only after it crossed 45 days. With the girl turning 46 days old on Monday, the samples were taken and despatched for the test. Doctors said that the tests would be done two more times  when the girl was 6 months old and one-and-a-half years old. GRH dean Dr K Vanitha said the baby was doing fine and there was in fact an improvement in its weight. Her birthweight was around 1.7kg, but now she weighs 2.8kg and she is very active now, the dean said. The hospital officials said an antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug  Nevirapine  given to prevent HIV infection was being continued for the baby. The doctors said that the babys 23-year-old mother was also fine, but the discharge of both of them who were still admitted at GRH wouldnt be done anytime soon, at least not until the next reassessment. Im happy that my baby is doing fine now, but Im nervous about the test results, the babys 27-year-old father told TOI. The government should take necessary measures to appoint both me and my wife in government jobs soon, as they had assured, he said. On December 3, the blood donated by an HIV-positive teenager was given to the woman when she was admitted to Sattur GH. The teenager donated the blood to a blood bank on November 30 without realizing he was HIV-infected. He later committed suicide after learning about his health condition.

"Pre-marital check-up a must, say Kolkata doctors","KOLKATA: When it comes to matchmaking, horoscope is not the only thing the couples need to check.",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: When it comes to matchmaking, horoscope is not the only thing the couples need to check. Though a few nowadays go for pre-marital health check-ups, the number is still far from satisfactory. But, doctors said that such check-ups can avoid some unwanted events in future like that of the birth of a baby with thalassaemia and with certain disorders. On Saturday, Ruby General Hospital (RGH) announced its pre-marriage checkup clinic. Currently, NRS Medical College and Hospital runs clinic for antenatal thalassaemia screening. There are many couples, who approach us with haematological reports and ask us to help in charting their future plans. Thats why we have decided to come up with this clinic, said Subhasish Datta, general manager (operations) at RGH. Apart from running thalassaemia, HIV and blood group screening tests, the clinic also offers analysis to determine the couples emotional and psychological compatibility. The hospital has roped in Bonding Tree, an organisation that has been conducting such pre-marital health check-ups in the city. While analysing couples on their expectations from each other, at times we find some disparity. We can help them narrow the gap, said Sukanta Mitra, psychologist with Bonding Tree. In fact, more hospitals should come up with this kind of clinic and such check-ups should become mandatory for couples, who are planning to get married, said Dr D P Sammader, director medical affairs at RGH. If a couple wants to get married despite both or one of them being thalassaemia carrier, we cant discourage them. But they will at least have a choice as far as having a child is concerned. In fact, all obstetricians should ask married couples for antenatal screening for thalassaemia, said Dr Prantar Chakrabarti, head of haematology at NRS.

"At Delhi mall, transgenders say with pride theyâ€™re Born This Way","Days after Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which condemned LGBTQ citizens to humiliation and denial, was read down by the Supreme Court, the tra",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Days after Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which condemned LGBTQ citizens to humiliation and denial, was read down by the Supreme Court, the transgender community came together in strength and solidarity on Tuesday at Delhis Select Citywalk for the annual Hijra Habba. Organised by the HIV/AIDS Alliance India, the event, whose theme this year was Born This Way, brings together transgender advocates, international agencies and health organisations to present their perspectives, with song and dance and much good cheer. We are the only sexual minority that is visible to the naked eye, said Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, a prominent activist and head of the first transgender religious akhara. While hijras and transgender groups once had important roles in Indian society, they are yet to fully realise their freedoms. They are cast out of familial structures and political decision-making, leaving Tamanna Keni, 26, an activist from Thane, to rue, We used to be the mahalon ki zeenat (pride of the palaces) in Mughal times and the Maratha durbars had a place for us, but now we are left behind. A survey of the National Human Rights Commission has established that 92% of the transgender community are economically marginalised. They rely on begging and sex work, and frequently face discrimination, even violence. A full 98% of transgender persons live apart from their families, so have for support their chosen gurus (the person your heart goes out to, as Tamanna described the relationship) and their peers. This gives them a sense of community, but also sharpens their isolation from wider society. The Hijra Habba, in that sense, is an attempt to connect the community within itself and with others. Tuesdays event started with a flash mob by the group Harmless Hugs. Many visitors were intrigued enough to stay and listen. I had only heard myths, or seen hijras at ceremonies like weddings or births. I was just curious, admitted Puneet Kumar, a 24-year-old MNC executive. He clapped enthusiastically at drag queen (also Mr Gay India 2014) Rani Kohinoors versions of Ambar sariya and I will survive almost as if responding to the emcees exhortation: Iss function mein taaliyon ki kami nahi honi chahiye. The Indian state recognises gender-variant identities in public documents, and many states like Tamil Nadu have dedicated transgender welfare programmes. The Supreme Courts groundbreaking Nalsa judgment in 2014 made a basis for self-identified gender identity  the fact that you know the gender you identify with, irrespective of medical diagnosis, and that the law must give you your full due as a citizen. A transgender rights bill is pending in Parliament. Officials from agencies like the HIV/AIDS Alliance, National AIDS Control Organisation, USAID and UNAIDS spoke of being in this together. Cricketer Gautam Gambhir too expressed his support, congratulating everyone on the dilution of Section 377. Activist Gauri Sawant, one of those who had moved the Supreme Court on behalf of the transgender community, spoke of giving back to society and how one could invest care and attention on others. Sawant, who works in an initiative called Nani ka Ghar for the children of sex workers, said her own sense of family was Mere chele mere bachche hain. She explained, Motherhood is a behaviour, it doesnt mean giving birth to a baby. An exhibition at the event introduced visitors to the transgender community, what it means to identify as a woman or man, the behaviours one learns by wearing a bindi or holding up a false moustache. It introduced people to prominent trans persons and to cultural references like Bahuchara Mata, a patron deity of the hijra community. To walk through the space is to understand what it means to be born in the way we all are but being force-fitted into a rigid gender identity.

â€˜Proactiveâ€™ strategy against externment order violators,PUNE: The police registered 250 cases under the Maharashtra Police Act in 2018 against externed criminals found violating the externment orders by ill.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"PUNE: The police registered 250 cases under the Maharashtra Police Act in 2018 against externed criminals found violating the externment orders by illegally entering the city limits. Charge sheets were filed against 201 of these offenders. We are specifically pursuing this legal option in the wake of rising instances of externed criminals entering the city limits and indulging in criminal activities, Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said on Friday. One of the effective steps towards checking such violations is to secure a speedy trial for such offences. Section 142 of the Maharashtra Police Act provides for summary trial in such cases. We are proactively moving courts within 24 hours of such violations for a speedy summary trial, he said. Criminals on police records with two or more offences of serious nature against their names, especially cases where people have been either threatened or subjected to criminal force, are externed from the Pune city and district limits for periods ranging from one to two years. In the past four months, many externed criminals have been arrested in the city limits carrying fire arms and sharp weapons or while attempting to loot cash of the ATM kiosks. One of the externees was found enjoying dinner at his Bibvewadi residence recently by the night patrol staff of the police. DCP (Crime) Shirish Sardeshpande said, It is a gross violation of externment orders. The number is high and we are taking all the precautions to avert such incidents in the future. In 2018, externment orders were issued against 113 criminals as against 159 in 2017, 99 in 2016 and 82 in 2015.

Probe indicts several staff for HIV+ blood transfusion,CHENNAI: The state government has decided to take strict action against the healthcare professionals responsible for the mix-up that led to a pregnant.,Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The state government has decided to take strict action against the healthcare professionals responsible for the mix-up that led to a pregnant woman being given HIV-infected blood in a Sivaganga hospital and to formulate rules that will clearly fix responsibility for every step of the blood collection, storage and transfusion process. The six-member inquiry committee headed by the additional director of medical services, Dr S Madhavi, indicted the district blood bank professionals, staff and voluntary testing centre counsellor in Sivakasi, and the Chennai-based monitoring officers working with the Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society. A senior health official said, We have an existing guideline which tells blood bank professionals what they should do. The new one will fix responsibilities on who should conduct camps, who should draw blood and who should maintain cold chain. We have suspended two lab technicians, Valarmathi and Ganesh Babu, along with lab counsellor Ramesh. We also found that the seniors they reported to, including senior blood bank officials and district monitoring officials, were negligent. We will be initiating action against all of them, said a senior official. The counsellor was aware of the HIV status of the donor in 2016 but did not persistently call the donor or escalate the case to higher officials when unable to get in touch with the donor. District monitoring officials, who should have sought regular status reports from the counsellor, did not follow up on the case. Lab technicians say they tested the blood before labelling it as safe, the committee said and added that the kits used by the government were provided by National AIDS Control Organisation and did not fail quality tests. In this case, we have reason to believe that the tests were never done and the blood bank managers too failed to monitor blood safety, the official said.

Brush with reality: The true colours of Indian farmers,"When Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra started travelling to the rural hinterlands of Punjab and rest of the country about seven years back, there was on",Tnn,11-03-2019,The Times of India,"By: Swati.Bhan CHANDIGARH: When Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra started travelling to the rural hinterlands of Punjab and rest of the country about seven years back, there was one thought that cut across their minds invariably. How difficult was it to brush down the pain and trauma of the farm distress over a canvas? But they believed, they had to, as it was the only way they knew to put across the agony of the farmers to the society at large. And years later, the two artists have brought out an exhibition of these paintings highlighting the distress caused by the farmer suicides in the rural areas of the state as well as the country. The exhibition, titled Farmer is Wrestler, began at Punjab Lalit Kala Academy from Wednesday. The exhibition will remain open till March 5 for art lovers. Not new to the subject the artist duo who are a native of Punjab say that their familiarisation with the subject of farmers' suicide and farm distress have been on for the last one decade. ""It was a research that was published in a daily about 10 years ago on the lack of government interest that provoked our thoughts to work on this subject,'' said Thukral. For giving their work a realistic touch, the two decided to travel to the epicentres of the farm distress not just in Punjab but rest of the country. ""Travelling in different parts of the country and having interacted with farmers in all these years we realised that farming and distress had become synonyms in different parts of the country,'' said Tagra. They say that in cases especially in Punjab it was the dream and aspiration of escape for a dreamland that led to the detachment from the soil. ""Many wanted to get away from the problem that they were apprehending, depleting water levels and rising loans but it was the growing aspirations and lack of opportunities that has put the farming community at a crossroad,"" said Tagra. The artists have equated the farmers metaphorically to wresters who are also connected to the soil raised questions on several aspects of the farmers desperation including the latest farmers rally held in the capital. ""The images of the farmers with skulls in their hand had got imprinted in our minds and we wanted to bring it to images that led to this kind of display of sorrow,"" said Thukral. As artists the duo say that they do want to ensure that the message of the reasons for distress is not just pondered upon but solutions be brought about to reduce the number of suicides. And it was not only the people in power who could do that but common people too could play an effective role in protecting the producers of food, commented the two. With a combination of canvas and sculpture that are exhibited in the academy gallery, the artists have left their thoughts as open ended questions for the visitors to realise. This is not the first time that they have focused on serious issues like this one. ""We had exhibitions earlier on issues like HIV and we intend to draw our attention toward education as well,"" said Thukral.

Discrimination of HIV+ patient: NGO files complaint,"PANAJI: Human touch foundation, a voluntary organisation, has complained to health minister Vishwajit Rane about the discriminatory treatment meted ou.",Tnn,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Human touch foundation, a voluntary organisation, has complained to health minister Vishwajit Rane about the discriminatory treatment meted out to an HIV+ patient at Goa Medical College (GMC), Bambolim.

Borges said people, including those with HIV, expect from GMC healthcare services that are decent, respectful and free of prejudice and stigma.

Sahu's ordeal started when he saw an advertisement in a local newspaper calling for kidney donors. Sahu decided to offer his kidney to help the man in need and contacted a local hospital in the city. Following the preliminary medical check-up, the hospital found that Sahu is infected with HIV. The hospital's faulty diagnosis marked a turning point in Sahu's life. His marriage broke down. His family and friends abandoned him. Heartbroken, Sahu started contemplating suicide. Not ready to give up on his life, Sahu approached a private hospital in Kolkata with the help of one of his friends. Another round of tests found Sahu to be perfectly healthy. Bewildered, Sahu sought another opinion from a hospital based in Alipore. There too the tests came out as negative. Sahu immediately approached the consumer court against the first hospital, responsible for his misdiagnoses. After hearing Sahu's case, the court ordered the hospital to give a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to Sahu. ""I want to start again. Want to live again,"" Sahu said.

Matrimony site for HIV-positive people launched at IIM-A,AHMEDABAD: Itâ€™s Cupid for people with HIV.,Tnn,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"AHMEDABAD: Its Cupid for people with HIV. A website, launched at IIM-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) by Surat-based organizations Sri Rama Krishna (SRK) Group and Gujarat Sate Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GSNP+), will connect persons with HIV/AIDS across the globe. An initiative of GSNP+, the website has financial support from SRK Knowledge Foundation and technical support from IIM-A. IIM-A director Errol DSouza said the website represented a progressive step. He said that field surveys indicate that the number of people living with HIV is higher than official estimates.Daksha Patel, the founder of GSNP+, said that about 16 lakh people live with HIV in India. In Gujarat, 68,000 persons regularly visit ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres, she said. The actual number  including those taking treatment at private centres might be higher. With the rise in longevity thanks to modern treatment, there has been an increase in demand for matrimony services. However, this matrimony service works way differently from the standard ones. GSNP has so far organised six major meetings for prospective brides and grooms living with HIV and has been instrumental in 245 weddings in about a decade. The registered members for matrimony are about 1,900. Onerous challenges face patientsIt was Rasik Bhuvas case that became instrumental in starting the matrimony service and eventually the website for GSNP+. I was diagnosed with HIV soon after my engagement. I was quick to break the relationship off citing health issues, said Bhuva. When I started counselling HIV patients, I met a girl from Navsari and we tied the knot. He admitted that even today many prefer not to disclose their positive status to their close family members. We have made it a norm to at least involve one senior family member from both sides to avoid any trouble later, he said. The problem is more acute in rural areas where we go to the patients home as bank or government officials to administer medicines.

"Smoke billows from LPG truck, mishap averted",KOCHI: Tense situation prevailed at Kalamassery when smoke billowed from a moving mini-truck laden with cooking gas cylinders near Premier Junction ar.,Tnn,30-08-2018,The Times of India,"KOCHI: Tense situation prevailed at Kalamassery when smoke billowed from a moving mini-truck laden with cooking gas cylinders near Premier Junction around 10am on Saturday. A major tragedy was averted as passers-by used fire extinguishers from another vehicle to douse the blaze. As many as 62 gas cylinders were on the truck. ""Smoke billowed behind driver's seat. Fire had started to engulf one of the cylinders when a passer-by used fire extinguishers to douse the flame. It was a key spot on the highway and underneath the Metro. If it wasn't for the timely intervention of the passer-by, it could have led to a blast,"" said a fire force officer with Eloor fire station. ""Abdul Salam, a youth from HMT Colony, was in another vehicle. He had used a fire extinguisher to douse the fire after which others joined the task. We are planning to felicitate him,"" said councillor Abdul S. Meanwhile, a fire unit rushed to the spot within minutes and brought the situation under control. Fire tenders from Eloor fire station reached the spot by 10.30am. Officials said that the fire might have broken out due to leakage of fuel on to the silencer following a rupture in the pipe from the tank to fuel pump. Fire tenders used dry chemical powder to douse the fire and cooled the cylinders by pouring water to avert a potential explosion after being exposed to the heat. Fire units from Gandhi Nagar and Thrikkakara fire stations had also rushed to the spot. However, they were sent back as Eloor unit brought the fire under control by then. Fire force had continued cooling the cylinders for about 30 minutes before they were removed from the spot in another vehicle. A drill about a potential tanker disaster was held a few months ago at the same spot.

HIV positive woman lodges complaint against KMCH,CHENNAI: A woman from Mangadu on Saturday lodged a complaint at the city police commissionerate against the staff of Kilpauk Medical College and Hospi.,Tnn,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: A woman from Mangadu on Saturday lodged a complaint at the city police commissionerate against the staff of Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital staff for allegedly transfusing HIV-infected blood to her. On Friday, the woman met media persons and claimed that she learnt she was pregnant in December 2017. She was initially getting treatment at a primary health centre in Mangadu and subsequently, got blood tests, including that for HIV, done at a private hospital and the results showed that she was HIV negative. Her haemoglobin count, however, was found to be low and she was referred by the PHC to undergo blood transfusion at KMCH, she said. The woman underwent treatment at the hospital for around ten days and was discharged once haemoglobin levels improved. A few months later, she went for check up at KMCH and was found to be HIV positive, she said. The woman has alleged that she got the HIV infection after undergoing blood transfusion at KMCH and has accused the hospitals negligence for her plight. The woman and her husband are vegetable vendors. The couple levelled allegations against the staff at the KMCH. We are sure that we contracted the virus from the hospital, since we have results from an earlier test that show my wife didnt have the infection, the womans husband said. When we questioned KMCH staff after she tested positive post transfusion, they told there was not much that could be done now since she has contracted the infection. They argued that they were not responsible for her condition. Some of the staff members even told us that we wont be able to fight the case in court since we did not have the monetary backing to do so, he added. The woman who gave birth to a boy on September 15, said she was administered two units of blood at KMCH in April. The KMCH authorities said there seemed to have been some irregularities with the initial HIV screening done at private labs. They refused to speculate how the woman may have contracted the virus, but insisted that it did not happen at KMCH. Director of medical education Dr A Edwin Joe on Friday said the blood samples administered to the woman tested safe.

World has become 'dramatically healthier' in 20 years: Melinda Gates,"US News: ""The world has actually become dramatically healthier in the last 20 years. The story of the past two decades is a story of incredible improvement in",Pti,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The world has become ""dramatically healthier"" in the last 20 years mainly because of the global health funds, top US philanthropist Melinda Gates said Thursday, citing examples of India, Indonesia and Vietnam which moved up the ladder due to their economic growth. The story of the past two decades is a story of incredible improvement in the human condition, Melinda of the 'Bill and Melinda Gates' foundation said during a global conference with reporters along with her husband and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. ""The world has actually become dramatically healthier in the last 20 years. The story of the past two decades is a story of incredible improvement in the human condition. And it's one of the reasons Bill and I call ourselves optimists,"" she said. The poorest parts of the world not only became less poor, they also became much, much healthier, Melinda said. Under-five mortality rates have declined by more than 50 per cent since 1990, which is a dramatic improvement for the lives of the world's poorest and youngest, she said. Responding to questions, Bill said countries like India, Indonesia and Vietnam have moved up the ladder because of the economic growth. As such they will be getting less money from all of these funds. ""But making sure they don't drop any vaccines, that's been very well organised. India, because of its size, has always been treated as kind of a special case by GAVI, but they did roll out rotavirus and they will roll out pneumococcus,"" he said. GAVI, the vaccine alliance, is focused on childhood vaccines. Noting that the global health funds are behind a lot of this progress, Melinda said around the year 2000, the world started investing more in global health, and in particular, in global health institutions that really pooled the world's resources to buy things that would make the people healthier. ""When Bill and I are out travelling, we see this when we talk with families. Deaths due to infectious diseases like HIV, malaria, measles have halved from their 1990 levels, and they've contributed to nearly 100 per cent in the overall decline in mortality in poor countries,"" she said. There are GAVI, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which of course is working to eradicate polio, she said. The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and more recently, the Global Financing Facility, is focused on maternal and child health, Melinda said. Since 1999, the foundation has invested almost USD 10 billion in these global health funds, which represents USD 1 in every five they invest, she said. ""And we, obviously, would not make those investments and continue to make those investments if we didn't see the incredible return that we're getting in the payoff for the world,"" she said. Observing that the data has been really striking about these investments, Melinda said a child born today is twice as likely to survive past the age of five, compared to the year 2000. The human and economic benefits of this are just enormous. ""This incredible return on investment is why we're committed to funding these mechanisms in the future. The next two years is a really critical time for these mechanisms. ""Donors will come together in France in October to replenish the Global Fund, and next year, they'll focus, then, on GAVI after that,"" Melinda said. As such this year in 2019, the Gates couple, she said, will be talking a lot the impact they have seen from these funds to date and the impact they could have over the next 15 years. Bill said all these institutions have made tremendous contribution to global health. These institutions faced lots of problems trying to get the prices down, try to get the supply to be reliable, trying to get out, deliver to some of the toughest places in the world, including extremely rural areas with no infrastructure, including places like Pakistan and Afghanistan, where there are areas where war is taking place, he said. Over the next 18 months, all these institutions are kind of a critical point where the level of distraction by domestic issues or issues that are confined to the rich world do make them somewhat concerned that the great success story here and the need to renew these resources may not get the attention it deserves, he said. The first to go on this is the Global Fund, which just announced the USD 14-billion investment case for its sixth replenishment last week. The actual replenishment will take place in October in France under President Emanuel Macron's leadership, he said. ""We are really excited to see the ambitious plan they have there and hope we can get either close to or get to that number,"" Bill added.

Womenâ€™s panel: No aid for HIV patient,"Physical torture of inmates in West Bengal, no medical aid for HIV patient in Odisha and no treatment for mentally-challenged women in Uttar Pradesh",Tnn,08-08-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Physical torture of inmates in West Bengal, no medical aid for HIV patient in Odisha and no treatment for mentally-challenged women in Uttar Pradesh were some of the key findings of the womens commission during inspection of shelter homes in these states. The inquiry committee appointed by the National Commission for Women inspected five Swadhar Greh in West Bengal, eight in Odisha, eight in Karnataka and five in Uttar Pradesh. Out of 26 Swadhar Greh, only one is running as per the guidelines of the scheme, according to the report submitted to the NCW by the inspection committee. These rehabilitation centres were either Centre-funded or NGO-run short-stay homes for the sexually abused and destitute. In Uttar Pradesh, mentally-challenged inmates were found living in these homes but there was no sign of any treatment for them, who are rolling on the floor at the time of inspection. In West Bengal, the inmates complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh. Seven of the inmates are mentally-challenged women and the Swadhar Greh is like a congested prison. The building, kitchen and rooms are dirty and unhygienic, the report on the condition of the shelter home in West Bengal said. In Odisha, one inmate with a child, a trafficking case, complained to the committee that she is a HIV patient and the NGO is not providing any medication to her. Though, she wants to go back to her parents, she was forced to stay back in the Greh by the NGO, the report said. Womens commission chairperson Rekha Sharma proposed introduction of a system like uploading the up-to-date data of inmates on the website of women and child development department. pti Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

Islamabad seeks ex-envoy Hussain Haqqaniâ€™s extradition from US,Pakistan News: Pakistanâ€™s government has initiated a process of seeking extradition of its former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani on allegations of embezzlement.,Ians,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"Pakistans government has initiated a process of seeking extradition of its former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani on allegations of embezzlement following its failure to get him through Interpol. Haqqani, who served as ambassador from 2008 to 2011 in US, was removed from office for his alleged role in the Memogate issue. The controversy revolved around a memo seeking help from the Obama administration in the wake of the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden to avert a military takeover in Pakistan. The FIA registered a case for embezzlement of $2 million against Haqqani in March 2018 relating to his tenure as ambassador, expecting that a criminal charge would result in Interpol acting against Haqqani. Interpol turned down the FIA request to issue arrest warrants for Haqqani, who is now based in Washington. The case is now being made the basis for seeking his extradition.

Controlling HIV a social duty: Minister,"Thiruvananthapuram: Steps to control HIV virus should be seen as a social responsibility, said health minister K K Shailaja.",Tnn,15-01-2019,The Times of India,"Thiruvananthapuram: Steps to control HIV virus should be seen as a social responsibility, said health minister K K Shailaja. We have already initiated a project which will hopefully control the number of HIV patients, said the minister while inaugurating the World Aids Day observance here on Saturday. Referring to a recent report on the Nipah virus outbreak in May-June which differed on the number of deaths due to the infection from the official toll, the minister said there was no confusion. Kerala was the only state which successfully defended the outbreak. Those who have read the medical report on Nipah would clearly understand that statistics presented by the government was accurate. As per the official records, there are only 18 confirmed cases including the index case and 16 deaths. Recently, there was a confusion on the toll following the publication of a research paper in an international journal which also included four probable cases which were not confirmed by tests. Shailaja praised the efforts of the health department who successfully found the virus by the time the second death was reported. We identified the virus and initiated effective countermeasures which proved vital in controlling the outbreak. Patients who showed identical symptoms to the deceased were checked and their blood samples collected. Of the 18, who showed similar symptoms initially, 16 died but we were able to save two people. She further added that there was no point in saying that sending samples prior to confirming the disease would have made significant changes. Even the sample taken from a person, who lost four members to the virus, showed negative. So, saying things wouldve been different if we had sent in the samples earlier is pointless, she argued.

Heptulla was speaking at an event called Know your HIV status which was organized at the 1st BN Manipur Rifles ground on the occasion of World Aids Day. Undergoing the HIV test is a must as it helps early detection and can pave the way for healthy living. It is the responsibility of the society to take up this fight against the disease, she said. Adding that the fight against AIDS is also societal, economic and political, the governor expressed hope that experts and intellectuals would come up with suggestions which could help generate more awareness. This is not a battle to be fought by health officials and activists, but civil society groups should also come forward, she said. Appreciating the role of NGOs, Heptulla spoke about the need to spread more awareness about the disease. Chief minister N Biren Singh, who was also present on the occasion, said though the prevalence of AIDS is declining in the state, it is still very common in Manipur. The prevalence rate of HIV in Manipur is 1.43% while the rate is 0.022% in the country. Calling for an end of discrimination against AIDS patients, Biren urged NGOs and the people to come forward to take the fight forward. The government aims to ensure that there are no new HIV cases in Manipur by 2024, he added. Health minister L Jayantakumar said only awareness can put an end to the stigma and discrimination against AIDS patients. He called for a collective effort to eradicate the disease from the state.

Woman who contracted HIV via blood transfusion to get best treatment,MADURAI: The government has announced that the best medical care will be provided to the pregnant woman who became HIV positive after a blood transfus.,Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The government has announced that the best medical care will be provided to the pregnant woman who became HIV positive after a blood transfusion at the government hospital in Sivakasi. Speaking to reporters in Madurai and Virudhunagar, after carrying out an enquiry at the Sivakasi government hospital, health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan said great injustice had been done to the woman and her family. A preliminary inquiry has revealed that it was due to technical error and negligence, and three persons who were found to be responsible initially have been removed from service, he said. He said that he had spoken to the husband of the affected woman, and he had just three requests - one that his wife be given the best medical attention, that she be shifted out of Virudhunagar, and that the state government should ensure that no other person is affected due to such negligence. The woman is expected to give birth by the end of January 2019. Radhakrishnan said a team of doctors, including Dr Shanthi, Dr Natarajan and Dr Ranjith, had been assigned to attend to the woman exclusively and recheck all parameters as per protocol. The man who donated the blood had tested positive for HIV when he came to the Sattur government hospital blood bank in 2016. But, as the Integrated counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) had not informed him about his condition, he donated the blood at the same hospital on November 30. The woman was given the infected blood when she came for an antinatal check and the Sivakasi government hospital found her anaemic. Radhakrishnan said details of blood donation are computerised, and it would be ascertained how this man was not monitored. Three employees - a councillor with the ICTC, a lab technician and another person - who have not been named have been terminated from service. Dr Radhakrishnan said that eight lakh units of blood was donated in Tamil Nadu annually, and it was given to 12 lakh persons, as different components. The blood was screened for five tests - HIV, hepatis B and C, malaria and syphilis. There was no need for the public to panic The Sattur town police on Wednesday registered an FIR against unknown nurses and doctors. The case was registered under the Section 269 of the IPC - negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life - and 338 - causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others. Virudhunagar district superintendent of police M Rajarajan said they will take action against those who are found guilty, based on the report from medical experts. The victim, accompanied by her husband, visited the Sattur police station in the morning to lodge the complaint. The womans husband said higher authorities in the health department had threatened him when he tried lodge a complaint with the police. Meanwhile, the teenager whose HIV positive blood was transfused to a pregnant woman has attempted suicide by consuming poison. He has been rushed to Ramanathapuram government hospital. The 19-year-old from Thirusiluviyapuram village near Kamuthi worked in a fireworks manufacturing unit in Sivakasi. Ever since he was told about his infection he had been depressed.

They will be allotted one booth in every ward in the Jaipur city. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had declared that 5,000 dairy booths will be opened in the state for the women out of which 1,000 will be in Jaipur city. This will be done to empower women and to raise employment opportunities for them. Along with this, there are even plans to open a single window for licensing in the JMC office as the complaints of the public towards the authorities related to the issue of licensing for dairy booths are rising in number. This plan is made to keep a check on the officials so that problem will not be created for the general public. Jaipur city is divided into eight zones and at present in every zone a junior engineer (JEN) look after the matter but after the implementation of single window, soon two JEN and two clerks will look after the matters of four zones each in the office to be allotted in the JMC. Mayor Ashok Lahoti said, The decision to open a single window is taken to make the licensing scheme more transparent. There is a plan to open 1,000 new dairy booths in the city and new licenses will be given only to the ladies as per the social welfare scheme announced by the chief minister Vasundhara Raje. In all the 91 wards, we have planned to give one dairy booth to the women suffering from AIDS, cancer or is a widow, to help them earn a decent living. To increase the competition in the state regarding the milk sale JMC has even planned to give 100 booths to the Amul dairy which will also be the companys first entry in Rajasthan. The chairman of the licensing committee Mahesh Kalwani told TOI that the proposal for single window for licensing is made to give proper shape to the plans of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. I have met many people who have complained about the red tap-ism and corruption that is rampant during the time of license issuing. Even all the applications do not reach us as the officials send applications of those that fulfils their interests and pockets.

â€˜Donor ignoring ICTC summons being probedâ€™,"MADURAI: The claim of the ICTC counsellor that the teenage donor, who was responsible infecting for the pregnant woman from Sattur with the HIV virus,.",Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI: The claim of the ICTC counsellor that the teenage donor, who was responsible infecting for the pregnant woman from Sattur with the HIV virus, had tested positive for the virus in 2016 and that he had not answered the summons, was under investigation, said the project director of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Organisation (Tansacs) Dr K Senthil Raj. Dr Raj visited the infected woman and the donor at the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai on Thursday after visiting Virudhunagar and said that steps had been taken to ensure that the woman got the best possible treatment, and priority was to ensure that her unborn infant was not affected. On the donors claim that he had not got any call from the counsellor at the Sivakasi government hospital on his HIV positive status after he donated blood in 2016, he said that it was under investigation. All employees of the integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) were qualified in their respective fields and were appointed on contract basis which was renewed annually, with no recruitments being made in recent times, he said. The functioning of the centres was foolproof and that was why the longevity of the infected persons had gone up from 30 to 40 years when they were under regular medication. He urged mediapersons to refrain from interacting with the donor, who had claimed that he had attempted to commit suicide because the media was cornering him. Members of the Positive Network people were also interacting with him and his condition had stabilised, he said. Earlier, speaking at Virudhunagar, he said that 464 units of blood from the four blood banks in Virudhunagar district had been secured and re-examined and those from private banks would also be subjected to the same.

"HC, NHRC take suo motu cognizance",The Madras high court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) have taken suo motu cognizance of media reports that a pregnant woman was infec,Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) have taken suo motu cognizance of media reports that a pregnant woman was infected during blood transfusion and the HIV + teenager, who donated the blood, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. On Thursday, when the vacation bench of Justice S Vaidyanathan and Justice P T Asha started hearing, advocate RY George Williams made an urgent mention about the incident and sought the court to take suo motu cognizance of the matter. The judges acceded to the request and directed the Tamil Nadu health secretary to file a status report on the incident and actions taken. The report should be filed by January 3. The NHRC noted that families involved were trying to cope with the trauma even as more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public health care personnel. The commission has issued a notice to the chief secretary calling for a detailed report in the matter including action taken against the guilty and relief/counselling provided to the victims, within four weeks. It has been observed that the contents of the media reports, if true, amount to violation of human rights of the victims and medical negligence. As reported, had proper action been taken by the authorities when the donor was first recognized as a case of HIV+, the mishap could have been avoided. Now both, the donor and the recipient woman are going through trauma, said a press release from NHRC. A nationwide move is required to be taken to examine the procedures so that Right to Life of the innocent people is not violated, the NHRC said.

"Government knew donor was HIV+ve in 2016, failed to inform him","MADURAI/CHENNAI:The teenaged donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday .",Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI/CHENNAI:The teenaged donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday as the families struggled to deal with the tragedy and more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public healthcare personnel. The woman has lodged a complaint against unknown doctors and nurses for the transfusion and sought stringent action against them. Her husband, who is a daily-wage labourer, said the family did not want a government job as compensation, only the best medical care for the woman and child, which is expected to be born in January. The government has arranged all facilities at the Madurai government hospital and sacked three employees for the tragic mix-up. But there is evidence to show healthcare officials had at least two chances to prevent the tragedy. One, the donor had been identified as HIV positive two years ago, in 2016, when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur, a town in Virudhunagar district. The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at the government hospital there should have told the youth he had HIV. The counsellor did call him up but he said he was Bangalore and she only told him to report to the centre. Counsellors normally do not break the news over phone. But she did not pursue the case when he did not turn up for two years. Two, blood bank staff could have prevented the catastrophe had they tested the blood he donated on November 30, again at the Sattur GH. HIV issue: State asks six-member committee to file report in a weekThe lab technician labelled it safe and a woman and her unborn child are paying for his negligence. The teenager had donated blood because a relative of his needed it at the hospital. Since it was not used it was sent to the blood bank. It was issued to a woman at the Sivakasi GH on December 3. The woman, a B.Com graduate, had come to the GH for antenatal checks. Doctors told her she had to undergo blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days later, a private hospital in Madurai tested the donor positive for HIV and referred him to Sattur GH.He had gone to the private hospital because blood tests were mandatory for an employment visa. On inquiry, the counsellor at Sattur GH identified him. She called the blood bank to alert them. By then the blood was issued, an official said. Early on Wednesday, the distraught donor consumed rat poison and was hospitalized in Ramanathapuram district. The infected woman will be provided treatment at the Madurai government hospital, where three doctors have been detailed to take care of her, said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. The state has asked a six-member committee headed by additional director of medical services Dr.S Madhavi to inquire into the case and submit a report within one week.

International Women's Day 2018: HIV+ woman whoâ€™s spreading positivity,SURAT: Her life had many twists and turns as she had to pass from the toughest struggle for inclusion and acceptance after facing discrimination in so.,Tnn,30-11-2018,The Times of India,"SURAT: Her life had many twists and turns as she had to pass from the toughest struggle for inclusion and acceptance after facing discrimination in society when she was detected with HIV in 1997. At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country. Meet Daxa Patel, who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift. When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life, says 42-year-old Daxa. Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected. It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/ID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003. The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc. We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat, she said. Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat governments social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls. GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and wont have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level.

US Senate passes bill to avert shutdown,US News: WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas.,Pti,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"WASHINGTON: The US Senate has approved a legislation to temporarily fund the government in an effort to avoid a partial shutdown just before Christmas after President Donald Trump backed away from his demand for money for a border wall with Mexico. Senators on Wednesday passed the measure, which would keep government running to 8 February. The House of Representatives needs to pass similar bill to avoid a government shutdown this weekend. House, in which the Republicans currently has a majority, is expected to pass the bill, but unlikely to include funding for the border wall. Unless the issue is resolved, more than 800,000 federal workers would face furloughs or be forced to work without pay, disrupting government operations days before Christmas. Democratic Leader and Speaker-designate, Nancy Pelosi, said her party would support the bill to avert government shutdown. The House is likely to pass the bill on Thursday, before it heads to the President Donald Trump to sign it into law. Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with top congressional Democratic leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to shut down part of the government in service of forcing Congress to give him the full $5 billion he wants for a border wall. The administration appeared to soften its stance on Tuesday when White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox News, ""At the end of the day we don't want to shut down the government."" The border wall was central to Trump's presidential campaign. ""The American people know the president's wall is ineffective, expensive, and only serves as a political bone to his most conservative supporters  certainly not worth a government shutdown,"" Senator Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader, said. ""It's good that Republicans in the Senate finally realised that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country,"" Schumer said. ""It is unfortunate that Trump's demand for a border wall from sea to shining sea has held up seven appropriations bills that have been debated and passed out of committee on a bipartisan basis,"" said Senator Dick Durbin.

"Prison inmates to be screened for HIV, TB",TRICHY: The prison department has decided to screen all prison inmates for HIV and tuberculosis and has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) wit.,Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"TRICHY: The prison department has decided to screen all prison inmates for HIV and tuberculosis and has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with social welfare department and the Tamil Nadu AIDS Control Society as part of the national programme. In Trichy, the initiative will cover Trichy Central Prison, Special Prison for Women and nine sub-jails under the control of the central prison. Officials from the health department said that though the prevalence of HIV and TB is not high among inmates in the prisons in Trichy, since they are considered to be a special group and vulnerable to diseases, the initiative would check the spread of the diseases. Sources from the department said that around six inmates in Trichy prisons are HIV positive, while around five have TB. Such prisoners are put-up in separate cell blocks. While there are 1,263 inmates in central prison currently, around 70 are in special prison for women and 75 in sub-jails. Three medical officers are deputed to central prison and two for womens prison, while doctors from the respective primary health centres inspect the inmates in sub-jails. Trichy programme manager of district aids prevention and control unit (DAPCU), Dr S Martin Manivannan, said that the main goal behind the initiative is to spread awareness about HIV and TB among prisoners and curb the spread of diseases within the prison and after their release. We would give sensitisation programmes to inmates on possibilities on spread of HIV. Apart from this, tests would be done for those with HIV symptoms so that they are given timely treatment, he said. Deputy director of medical services, TB control, Dr S Savithri told TOI that sputum samples of all the inmates with TB symptoms would be collected over the next few days and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) would be performed to detect TB.

Patna: Met office forecasts drop in temperature,PATNA: Day as well as night temperature is expected to drop slightly along with windy conditions over the next few days in Patna and most other places.,Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"PATNA: Day as well as night temperature is expected to drop slightly along with windy conditions over the next few days in Patna and most other places in Bihar. Officials at Patna meteorological centre attributed the expected plunge in temperature to westerly winds. Westerly wind started blowing in the region from Friday morning and its speed also increased from 18 to around 28km/hr. The windy conditions will lead to plunge in temperature, said an official at Patna meteorological centre. The lowest minimum temperature in the state on Friday was recorded at Sabour at 8.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature in Patna, on the other hand, was 12.2 degrees C, which was a notch higher than the corresponding normal. The Met officials said the plunge in temperature may get averted for a few days, if a depression hitting north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh affects the weather in Bihar. The system may lead to formation of cloudy conditions in Bihar as well, which may avert the plunge in temperature, the official said.

Transsexual artists showcase their talents,"COIMBATORE: At four, Daniel discovered he didnâ€™t fit into the gender that people identified him by birth.",Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"COIMBATORE: At four, Daniel discovered he didnt fit into the gender that people identified him by birth. While he dressed like a boy, he felt as a girl inside. When he told his parents about it, they thought it was a passing phase. But he knew it was not. More than four decades later, though he is today married to a woman and has fathered a daughter, Daniel publicly identifies himself as Celia Deniels, a woman, and dresses as one. My wife and daughter accept me as I am, she says. On Monday, Celia, who lives and works in the USA, performed English and Tamil songs to a small gathering. Just like Celia, almost a dozen other transwomen shared their life stories and exhibited their artistic talents at an event titled Trans Talents Rendezvous that was organised by Sahodari Foundation in the city. The event also marked the 10th anniversary of the foundation, which was started by transgender artist and activist Kalki Subramaniam to help change the lives transgender people. Sahodari was born in pain, says Kalki. I was angry on seeing the way people from the transgender community were being treated. A transgender friend of mine was raped in front of my eyes and she died of HIV. So, I started Sahodari 10 years ago to work for the welfare of transgender people. Through the foundation, a group of transgender people made a set of short films in 2009, depicting their lives. The movies were widely viewed. The videos also helped to campaign for the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community in the legal battle to scrap Section 377, Kalki says. Through the foundation, she has sensitized several school and college students. The event saw dance and music performances, plays and a discussion between Kalki and transgender writer and activist Revathi. Bara Bobby, a transgender engineering graduate, who is also a trained bharatanatyam dancer, performed a dance, while Soundarya, Sabitha and Vineetha, all from the transgender community, performed a group dance. Art is a potent way to claim ones rights, say the artistes. While there are several art festivals organised by the state, transgender people are not represented in them. But today we have created several avenues to showcase our talents, says Revathi. Kalki expressed a similar view. Art is both entertaining and educating. So, its a powerful tool to express ourselves.

2 rescued girls to SEAL it with a kiss at weddings this weekend,"NAVI MUMBAI: After a slew of celebrity weddings, two in rural Panvel will be â€˜SEALedâ€™ with a kiss this weekend.",Tnn,18-09-2018,The Times of India,"NAVI MUMBAI: After a slew of celebrity weddings, two in rural Panvel will be SEALed with a kiss this weekend. Two women rescued from the streets of Mumbai 18 years ago will marry their suitors at a shelter home for homeless. Hasiya Philip (23) ran away from home as a six-year-old as she could not bear the beating of her stepmother. She was rescued from Bhandup and sent to SEAL (Social and Evangelical Association for Love) Ashram shelter in Panvel. And Usha Philip (24) had come to Mumbai from Gujarat to search for her sister as a little girl, but got lost at Girgaum Chowpatty. She too was rescued by a social worker and sent to the shelter, where they both grew up together and lived with other inmates. SEAL members said it is a very happy occasion for them as the girls have found grooms through arranged marriage. The brides-to-be told TOI that sometimes they wonder and shudder what their fate would have been had they not been rescued. Therefore, they are grateful at how things have turned out for them. I dont like to remember my childhood, when my stepmom used to beat me up. I dont know which city or town I was in, but I got into several long-distance trains to finally land in Mumbai suburbs. The 18 years at SEAL have been happy, and I am a bit sad to leave this wonderful place to get married. I can never forget SEAL Ashram and Pastor Philip, who is my father now, said Fasiya. SEAL founder, Pastor K M Philip, said, When Fasiya came to us as a child, she had nail injury marks all over her neck. Her stepmom used to grab her by the neck and beat her. Over the years, Fasiya became a good student and a great cook. She also did a beauticians course. It is nothing short of a miracle that she and Usha are settling down by getting married. Fasiya will marry a man who works in Oman and Usha a pastor based in Rajasthan. All children at SEAL call Pastor Philip and his wife Shibi papa and mommy as they have taken care of us over the years. That is why we feel sad to leave this place, but will always stay in touch with our parents and friends here, said Usha. I have seen them grow up from being traumatized, lost girls to elegant ladies who will now have their very own families and homes to look after. I thank the Lord for making us do and see such good things. Tomorrow, Fasiya and Usha will help others in distress, as they remember that they too were once blessed by the Almighty and helped to find their feet, said pastor Philip. SEAL, an NGO, works for rescue and rehabilitation of destitute and missing people on railway platforms and streets of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The shelter home has 258 rescued people, mainly HIV/TB patients, mentally challenged, handicapped, visually impaired and fully orphaned. SEAL has reunited 354 with families in India.

Scared villagers drain 36-acre lake after HIV+ woman drowns in it,"Hubballi: The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed.",Basvaraj Kattimani,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"Hubballi: The residents of Morab, around 30km from Hubballi, have refused to drink water from their village lake after an HIV-positive woman committed suicide by jumping into it a week ago. Unable to convince them, the authorities are now draining the water from the 36-acre lake  roughly the size of 25 football fields  which they hope to refill with water from the Malaprabha canal. The Morab lake is the biggest in Navalgund taluk and the only source of drinking water for villagers and cattle. As of now, villagers trek 2-3km to the Malaprabha canal to fetch water. This is unfortunate. We have been telling people not to panic as HIV does not spread through water. But the people are not convinced and they have started draining out the lake, said Dharwad district health officer Dr Rajendra Doddamani. Dr Glory Alexander, founder-director of Asha Foundation, which treats HIV+ patients, said it was a case of fear rather than stigma. ""It's sheer ignorance stemming from lack of awareness. When an HIV positive person dies, the virus also dies. Even if the virus comes out of the body, it cannot survive in water and dies in a couple of seconds. There is no risk of infection spreading from the water,"" she said. The body of the woman was found in the lake on November 29. Word immediately spread the water had been contaminated, creating panic. Villagers refused to drink the water and pressured the gram panchayat and the Navalgund taluk administration to drain the lake. Authorities tried to convince the villagers that the water was not contaminated and that they would test the water, but no one relented. The authorities have now deployed 20 siphon tubes with four motors to pump out the water. We found the body in a highly decomposed state, said Muttanna Bhavaikatti, from Morab village. We dont want to consume contaminated water. We are trekking 2-3km to fetch water from the Malaprabha right bank canal that flows through Morab. Pradeep Hanikere, another villager, said the daily hardship was preferable to drinking water from the lake. Do the officials drink bottled water if they find dirt or a speck in it? If they cant, then how can they force us to drink water from the lake where we found the body of a woman, he said. Another villager pointed out, We would have consumed the water if it was the body of a normal person; but the woman died of HIV. There is no other way: The authorities must drain out water and fill it with fresh water to save the lives of villagers. Gram panchayat member Laxman Patil said the villagers refused to see reason, so pipes have been sucking water out for the past four days. We managed to drain out lakhs of litres, and discharged the water in a nearby stream. We still have to drain water from 60% of the lake and need at least five days to empty it, he said. There is another problem, though. The taluk administration wants us to complete the task by December 6. They have warned the Malaprabha right canal will be closed after December 8, so we have to fill the water into lake before that. More than 50 people are involved in pumping out water. We will need 1-2 weeks to empty and fill the lake. Navalgund tahsildar Naveen Hullur said: We tried our best to convince people to drink the lake water but they refused outright. We offered to conduct tests to prove that the water is fit to drink. I will talk to officials to allow us to fill the lake from Malaprabha canal till December 20 or 22.

Centre for excellence in HIV care will be set up by December 2019: Vishwajit Rane,PANAJI: The Goa government will set-up a centre for excellence in HIV care in December 2019.,Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: The Goa government will set-up a centre for excellence in HIV care in December 2019. Health minister Vishwajit Rane made the statement while speaking as chief guest after attending Positive Power Summit 2018 organized by Human Touch, a voluntary organisation on the eve of World AIDS Day on Friday. Listening to various difficulties faced by children suffering from HIV, Rane said that the government will come up with a new policy and grants from the state budget will be provided for various initiatives to create infrastructure so that children afflicted with HIV can live a better quality of life. We, as policy-makers, need to change the narrative. We need to be more sensitive on how to take this issue forward, he added. Project director, Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), Dr Jose DSa said that the main goal is to attain zero HIV infection, zero conversion of HIV to AIDS, zero AIDS-related threats and most importantly, to remove discrimination. GSACS, he said, is trying to achieve this goal by 2020. Founder, Human Touch, Peter Borges said that during the last two years in Goa, 610 people have been found infected as HIV positive. He further said HIV is not only transmitted by sex but is transmitted by sexism, poverty and homophobia. If we are going to end the menace of AIDS, we must cure the disease in our heart and minds, he said. The organisation also appealed to stakeholders and the state government to take unprecedented and bold actions to advance efforts to end AIDS in the state by 2030. The summit reported on gaps encountered while implementing interventions with adolescents living with HIV.

Need change of mindset about sex to fight AIDS menace: NGO,"GUWAHATI: Pancharatna, a local NGO working towards eradication of AIDS, was awarded by the state government for their tireless efforts on the occasion.",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"GUWAHATI: Pancharatna, a local NGO working towards eradication of AIDS, was awarded by the state government for their tireless efforts on the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday. Speaking to TOI, the NGO said a change of mindset in talking about sex is necessary to fight the AIDS menace. Since 2008, the NGO has counselled more than 1000 individuals who are MSMs (men who have sex with men) in different locations of Nalbari district. Pancharatna has been bestowed with the responsibility to carry out the Targeted Intervention (TI) project with MSMs and transgenders. Health workers of the NGO have succeeded to persuade 22 MSMs to have health check-ups which detected that they were HIV positive. Fear of being ostracized had been one of the factors that kept the 22 men secretive about their sexual orientation and unable to take preventive measures. Its been a very difficult journey over the last 10 years. People still shy away from discussing sex. And the people who are MSM dont want to speak openly at all. They would always hide. So, it becomes even more difficult to trace them, Mahendra Baishya, chairman of Pancharatna, told TOI. After we notice homosexual behaviour, we engage with them by making friends with the help of our workers with similar feelings towards the same sex. Thats how they become open and then we persuade them for blood tests and the next steps, Baishya added. If anyone is found to be positive, they are immediately sent to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital for further treatment. He said that the age group of these 22 detected positive is from 20 to 35. Many of them are married but they were continuing unsafe MSM activities. This has also introduced threats for their wives and newborns. This is very dangerous, said Baishya. Narrating his experiences of the last decade, Baishya said only 30% change has come. People dont want to discuss sex openly. Until and unless we change this kind of mindset, we will not be able to fight this menace, said Baishya. The most effective means of controlling the spread of HIV in India is through the implementation of Targeted Interventions (TIs) amongst persons most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, such as female sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgenders and injecting drug users. As per the India HIV Estimation 2017 Fact Sheet, it is estimated that Assam has 13,539 people living with the disease. HIV prevalence in Assam is 0.06%, lower than the national average, which is 0.22%. The scenario is not at all pleasant because Assam is vulnerable to new HIV infections mainly because of inflow and outflow of migrants, said Samir Sinha, principal secretary of health and family welfare department.

Mediations help in AIDS fight,Forget preaching pseudo morality.Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preven,Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"KANNUR: Forget preaching pseudo morality. Targeted interventions among female sex workers and MSM (men who have sex with men) seem to be more helpful in preventing spread of AIDS. Most sex workers have now started engaging in sex with a limited number of clients and that too with only those who are personally known to them, according to people working among such communities. NGOs working among sex workers said the clients are also ready to undergo frequent medical check-ups. ""Nowadays, not many of them are seen on the streets. They work during daytime and meet only a limited number of clients who are known to them,"" said Shaji P M, coordinator of Chola, a Kannur-based NGO. Since the sex workers know most of their clients, they make sure that the ones who come to them undergo medical check-ups for HIV and other infections, he said. There are 749 female sex workers in contact with Chola and nearly 80% of them practice such methods, he said, adding there were 12 HIV-infected sex workers here a few years ago but none of them are working in the sex industry now. With the advent of smartphones and social media, the coordination has become easy for them and it has reduced the risk. According to Snehatheeram, another NGO, sexual minorities, including members of the MSM community, have also been following such methods . In the MSM community, there are people from all classes and now most of them indulge in sexual activity with known partners and it has reduced the risk of HIV infection, said an employee of the NGO. Thanks to such interventions initiated by the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), with the support of the NGOs, the risk of HIV infection has come down considerably, said Dennis Joseph, joint director of the society. ""The spread of HIV among sex workers has been reduced from 1.75% nearly a decade back to 0.01% now,"" he said. Last year, only four cases of HIV infection were reported among the sex workers in the state, and only two of them were registered with KSACS and two were outsiders, said KSACS. Similar interventions were made among drug users which helped them curb the habit of sharing syringes. Moreover, after realizing that they resort to crime to get money to procure drugs, facility was provided to get them drug, as part of the treatment, he said. As a result, the prevalence of HIV infection rate among drug abusers has come down from 10.5% to 0.41% in the past one decade, said the KSACS joint director.

Woman claims husband gave her HIV through saline,"PUNE: A 27-year-old woman from Thergaon lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Thursday alleging that her husband, a homeopath, had administered .",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PUNE: A 27-year-old woman from Thergaon lodged a complaint with the Wakad police on Thursday alleging that her husband, a homeopath, had administered her HIV-infected blood through saline to secure a divorce from her besides harassing her for dowry. Senior inspector Satish Mane of the Wakad police said, Medical reports of the woman shows that she has been infected with HIV from January. She alleged that her husband had injected her with infected blood while administrating saline when she was unwell in March last year. The woman said she underwent clinical tests when her condition deteriorated. The woman stated in her complaint that she did not have physical relationships with anyone other than her husband, Mane said. He said the police were yet to investigate if the husband was responsible for administering the HIV-infected blood into her body. Based on her complaint, we have booked her husband and sent her blood samples to a laboratory, Mane said. Infectious disease expert Bharat Purandare said, It is possible to transmit HIV either through an infected needle or by giving transfusion of infected blood. If the woman knows whose infected needle or blood was used to transmit the virus, a DNA test can be carried out on her and the HIV-affected person to establish the link. The woman stated in her complaint after her marriage in 2015, her husband and in-laws started harassing her for money to start a business. The womans father used to give in to their demands. However, the woman later refused to contact her father for more money, resulting in mental and physical harassment by the in-laws and her husband, Mane said. The woman said her husband hatched a plot to administer her HIV-infected blood because he did not have strong grounds for a divorce. The husband and his parents have been booked under sections 498A, 323, 504 and 506 of IPC. The husband has already filed for divorce in court, Mane said.

AIDS centre struggles to get patientsâ€™ kin tested,"PANAJI: For a long time now, the staff at Goa Medical Collegeâ€™s (GMC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre has been struggling to convince HIV/AIDS pat.",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: For a long time now, the staff at Goa Medical Colleges (GMC) antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre has been struggling to convince HIV/AIDS patients under its care to get their kin tested for the condition. Family members of not even 20% of the 8,000 HIV patients registered with ART have undergone the test. In the last few moths, four children were detected HIV positive after their parents reluctantly agreed to have them checked. An official from Goa state aids control society (GSACS) said, Early detection is very important to control the spread of the virus. The disease is a critical, but manageable one, yet those afflicted keep it a secret, not only from the society, but also from their own family, thus, exposing them to the disease. It is difficult to accept the reality of testing positive. A majority will try and keep their status hidden, said a counsellor who works with persons living with HIV/AIDs. The counsellor recounted about the time a 60-year-old woman from Sattari walked into the centre, complaining of severe headache and continuous body pain. The fragile, distressed woman caught the virus from her husband who died a while ago, the counsellor further said, adding that in many instances, senior citizens infected with the virus are diagnosed late. In another case, a woman tested positive after the death of her husband, who she had contracted the virus from. She was warned to her get son tested, but she never did so. Recently, her 24-year-old son also tested positive and is believed to have been infected via vertical transmission, he said. The numbers of people with of HIV are dropping, but it is a matter of concern that carriers of the virus do not take precautions despite warning. We could do better, only if all co-operate, he said.

Alcohol claimed 30 lakh lives across world in 2016: Nitish Kumar,PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said around 30 lakh people died because of harmful use of alcohol across the globe in 2016.,Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said around 30 lakh people died because of harmful use of alcohol across the globe in 2016. Quoting a recent study by World Health Organisation (WHO), the CM also pointed out that alcohol consumption causes death and disability relatively early in life. In the age group of 20-39 years, 13.5% of the total deaths in the world were alcohol-related, Nitish said while addressing a prohibition and excise departments function here. Referring to the WHO report published on September 21 this year, the CM also pointed out that 5.3% of all deaths in the world in 2016 were due to alcohol consumption. The adverse effects of alcohol consumption was greater than those of tuberculosis (2.3%), HIV/AIDS (1.8%), diabetes (2.8%), hypertension (1.6%), digestive diseases (4.5%), road injuries (2.5%) and violence (0.5%) across the world, the CM said. Countering his critics who claim that tourist flow has sharply gone down in Bihar after the enforcement of total prohibition, Nitish said tourist footfall in the state had increased after prohibition and it went above three crore people last year. More than 10 lakh foreign tourists arrived in the state last year, he said. Nitish also pooh-poohed his critics claim that the state had to suffer a huge revenue loss due to the liquor ban. We suffered a revenue loss of Rs 1,000 crore only in the first financial year after enforcement of prohibition. After that, the state government received extra revenue and taxes from other heads as the money saved by people after the liquor ban was used in purchase of other consumer items from the market. In that way, people paid more taxes to the government, the CM said. Praising Nitish for enforcing prohibition in April 2016, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said, It was not a simple decision. It could be implemented because of the courage shown by the CM. Download The Times of India News App for Latest City .Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

3 children die while 'playing with bomb' in Arunachal,"The incident occurred at Chirang village under Hayuliang circle, when the children, all in the age group of 7-10, were playing with the live explosive",Tnn,04-12-2018,The Times of India,"ITANAGAR: Three children, including two girls, were reportedly killed in an accidental blast of a live bomb near an Army firing range in remote Anjaw district of Arunachal Pradesh on Saturday night, a senior district official said on Sunday. The incident occurred at Chirang village under Hayuliang circle, when the children, all in the age group of 7-10, were playing with the live explosive. The bomb had been collected by their parents from the nearby firing range and kept at the house, deputy commissioner D Riba said.

â€˜11 blood units found HIV-infected in â€™17â€™,"LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King Georgeâ€™s Medical University (KGMU) were found to be infected .",Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"LUCKNOW:In 2017, as many as 11units of blood donated at the community blood bank of King Georges Medical University (KGMU) were found to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually. The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, Blood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded. Docs: NAT saved 9k lives by detecting infected blood unitsBut, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. NAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected, said Prof Chandra. She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years. There is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means, she added. Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method. ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate.

"Now, project for women drug users",Chandigarh: The Punjab health department launched a harm reduction project for women who use drugs.,Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"Chandigarh: The Punjab health department launched a harm reduction project for women who use drugs. The project would be implemented on pilot basis in Kapurthala district of Punjab, in partnership with Harm Reduction Advocacy in Asia (HRAsia), Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The project aims at maximizing the impact of investments that can help break the cycle of transmission of HIV among person who inject drugs. Dr Umang Chawla, director (policy) India HIV/AIDS Alliance said that harm reduction refers to policies, programmes and practices that aim primarily to reduce the adverse health, social and economic consequences of the use of drugs.

Childrenâ€™s home guard not guilty of sodomising HIV+ boy,"NEW DELHI: Terming it a â€œclassicâ€� and â€œunsolvedâ€� mystery, the Delhi high court acquitted a security guard of a childrenâ€™s home of the charge of repeat.",Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Terming it a classic and unsolved mystery, the Delhi high court acquitted a security guard of a childrens home of the charge of repeatedly sodomising a minor orphan boy who is HIV positive. Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial courts verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a ""travesty of justice"" to convict him of having committed such an unsolved crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial courts finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner. Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge ignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted. In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. The situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved locked room mystery, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court). This is entirely impermissible in law, HC noted. While the child's father was in jail, his mother had died of HIV and, as there was not nobody to look after him, he was sent to the children home for boys.

Snatchers' den under VIP Road median divider stumps cops,"KOLKATA: Reacting to a complaint of mobile phone snatching, Bidhannagar Police was stumped to find a gang of thieves living under a hollow space under.",Tnn,25-11-2018,The Times of India,"KOLKATA: Reacting to a complaint of mobile phone snatching, Bidhannagar Police was stumped to find a gang of thieves living under a hollow space under a blackstone ox sculpture on the beautified median divider on VIP Road, opposite Kolkata airport. This hideout was a major security glitch considering the fact that hundreds of VIPs and dignitaries pass along the stretch every day. ""The discovery has allowed us to avert one of the biggest law and order and security threats in recent times. We had no clue that some criminals had been hiding under the statue. Criminals could have easily used the space to attack any dignitary, who may have been using the stretch,"" said an officer of Airport police station, who busted the gang on Sunday. On Sunday, a youth in his twenties came running to a group of civic police volunteers on duty at the crossing of VIP Road and Airport Road and complained of being robbed by three men while he was waiting for a bus to reach his home at Barasat. ""The youth was bleeding from his nose and scratch marks on his lips, face and neck. He told us that three men had just dragged him to a tunnel like structure at the middle of the road and robbed his cellphone, wallet and watch. We took him to the spot and were stunned to find a hollow space, large enough to fit in four men, under the stature covered by corrugated sheets and old banners,"" said the police officer. Inside, there was a pile of liquor bottles, bags, clothes, syringes, a mosquito net and even some cash. Cops seized the stuff, destroyed the den and arrested one, who was hiding there. ""We have arrested one person, Shoaib Molla (32), and charged him under IPC sections 399 and 402 that deal with assembling and making preparations to commit dacoity. We are questioning him to know for how long they have been staying there and who all are his associates,"" said the officer.

"Woman contracts HIV after blood transfusion, Madras HC seeks report",CHENNAI: The Madras high court Thursday took suo motu cognisance of an incident in which a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district contracted HIV afte.,Pti,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"CHENNAI: The Madras high court Thursday took suo motu cognisance of an incident in which a pregnant woman in Virudhunagar district contracted HIV after transfusion of contaminated blood and directed the state government to file an action taken and status report by January 3. When the vacation bench comprising justice S Vaidyanathan and justice PT Asha commenced proceedings, two advocates made a mention of the case. The advocates -- George Williams and Krishnamoorthy -- moved an urgent motion about the blood transfusion and sought the court to take suo motu cognisance of the issue. Williams submitted that he would like to bring the matter to the notice of the court and was not willing to file any petition. The Bench then said it would like to take suo motu cognisance and issued notice to the health secretary seeking a status report on the incident and action taken against the errant officials by January 3. On December 3, the woman visited the Sattur government hospital for antenatal checks where she was advised blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days after the procedure, it came to light that the blood transfused was HIV positive and was negligently labelled safe by the hospital's lab technicians. Originally, the blood was donated by a teenager which was meant to be transfused to his relative. But, since it was not used, it was stored in the blood bank. Immediately after the issue was brought to the notice of the authorities, three health workers of the blood bank at the government hospital in Sivakasi were placed under suspension for labelling the HIV positive blood as safe. On further inquiry, it was found the hospital authorities had found that the donor was affected by HIV as early as 2016 when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur. But as the teenager was out of town when a counsellor phoned him to inform, he was asked to report to the hospital as early as possible. On December 27, the donor had attempted suicide by consuming rat poison as his family struggled to deal with the issue.

HIV+ donor who infected woman tries to kill self,"India News: MADURAI/CHENNAI: The teenage donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday .",Tnn,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"MADURAI/CHENNAI: The teenage donor, whose blood infected a pregnant woman with HIV, attempted suicide at his home in southern Tamil Nadu on Wednesday as the families struggled to deal with the tragedy and more details emerged of criminal negligence on the part of public healthcare personnel. The woman has lodged a complaint against unknown doctors and nurses for the transfusion and sought stringent action against them. The government has arranged all facilities at the Madurai government hospital and sacked three employees for the tragic mix-up. But there is evidence to show public health care officials had at least two chances to prevent the tragedy. For one, the donor had been identified as HIV positive two years ago, in 2016, when he donated blood at a camp in Sattur in Virudhunagar district. The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the government hospital there should have told the youth he had HIV. The counsellor did call him up but only told him to report to the centre. Counsellors normally do not break the news over phone. But the counsellor she did not pursue the case when he did not turn up . Second, the blood bank staff could have prevented the catastrophe had they tested the blood he donated on November 30, again at the Sattur government hospital. The lab technician labelled it safe and a woman and her unborn child are paying for his negligence. It had been issued to a woman at the Sivakasi GH on December 3. The woman had come to the GH for antenatal checks. Doctors told her that she had to undergo blood transfusion as she was anaemic. Four days later, a private hospital in Madurai tested the donor positive for HIV and referred him to Sattur GH. ""He had gone to the private hospital because blood tests were mandatory for an employment visa. On inquiry, the counsellor at Sattur GH identified him. She called the blood bank to alert them. By then the blood was issued,"" an official said. Download The Times of India News App for Latest India News.Make sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

The",Tnn,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"LUCKNOW: A gang selling adulterated blood was busted in Faizullaganj area of Madiaon with the arrest of five persons, including the mastermind, on Friday. The arrests were made by UP Special Task Force. The accused were identified as Naseem Ali, Rashid, Raghvendra Pratap Singh, Pankaj Tripathi and Rajnish Nigam, all residents of Lucknow. Ali was the gangs mastermind and ownercum doctor of a nursing home in Faizullaganj. Raghvendra and Pankaj work as technicians at a private blood bank in city. STF got a tip-off that the gang used to collect and prepare blood bags in Alis home in Rukmaniganj in Faizullaganj and sold it illegally in prominent government hospitals. The gang also had a small unit in sixth lane in Nishatganj.

Rehana Fathima is no pilgrim,By: J Devika Ever since chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared CPMâ€™s commitment to Keralaâ€™s unique legacy of enlightened Hinduism on the Sabarimala .,Updated,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"By: J DevikaEver since chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared CPMs commitment to Keralas unique legacy of enlightened Hinduism on the Sabarimala issue, I have been wondering about the relative absence of CPMs mass organization of women, whose membership runs into lakhs. I have firsthand knowledge that very many of its members are devout Hindus. If CPM were serious about drawing upon this legacy, I wondered, why is it that they are not making an active effort to encourage these women (and devout men in their other mass organizations) to embrace the Supreme Courts valiant effort to ensure gender equality in the Hindu faith? Why is it not actively campaigning within its fold that undertaking the Sabarimala pilgrimage at this crucial moment in history is a key gesture of self-respect for female devotees? If CPM would have done that, we would not have been subject to this extremely painful sight of women trying to make it to the shrine, only to be violently ejected by criminals, hooligans and frenzied women, all emboldened by the brazen takeover of public space there by Hindutva elements. Definitely, CPM could have made sure that believers in their fold, male and female, made it to the shrine safe and sound. If so, stray activists need not have risked their lives. I do not know if Rehana Fathima, a young woman who has often cocked a snook at conservative gender/sexual norms, who attempted the pilgrimage on Friday, was deliberately set up by Hindutva elements to create the impression that the shrine was in the danger of being sullied by bad/women who are also non-Hindu. I dont know if minister Kadakampally Surendrans intervention was really to avert violence. Even if his intervention was really to that end, his indignant pronouncement that Sabarimala was not a playground for activists did irreversible harm. In itself, there is nothing wrong with Rehanas action: the Supreme Court permits womens entry now and tradition does not bar people of other faiths from visiting the shrine. There are no standards established to measure the intensity of belief; even if they do exist, they are not applied to potential male pilgrims. It may indeed be the case that there were good reasons for the minister to stop Rehana. My point is, however, about the discourse he couches it in, which turns it into an affront against believers. This is not mitigated by his shrewd choice of words  activist, instead of Muslim-born, or wayward woman. One is even persuaded to think that CPM and BJP have arrived at a resolution of this chicken-game-like situation in which neither party can turn back without suffering loss of face. The resolution involves setting up an other around which true believers may consolidate themselves, the constituency of BJP, but one which CPM would like to woo too. Kadakampallys offended tone directed at the activist would help CPM do exactly this as it conveys a commitment to the purity of the shrine, even as it continues to encourage the believing/ good woman! The stance adopted by CPM supporters  that they do not ask any woman to visit the shrine, only ensure a safe pilgrimage for any woman who chooses to go  creates the impression that there are no believers among them and therefore the toil of democratizing the Hindu community does not fall on them. This allows them to keep their mainstream Hindu base more or less invisible, exempt themselves from the burden of shaping new believers from within, and at the same time, keep up the appearance of neutrality in matters of religious faith. Nevertheless, they do want to gain from the social momentum unleashed by the Supreme Court judgment. Hence the goodcop bad-cop game: Pinarayi thunders about the legacy of Keralas social democratization in general (or Kodiyeri Balakrishnan defends activists); Kadakampally reacts in harsh tones against the specific instance of a womens activist trying to make hay while the sun shines. Kadakampally keeps his liberal-Hindu image, of one who supports true women of the faith and simultaneously signals his commitment to the purity of Sabarimala. The scapegoat in this sordid game is the activist woman, a figure feared by both Hindutva right wing and Left-wing mainstream. There can be little doubt that these activist women have caused these authorities the greatest worry in recent years. From sex workers to nuns, teagarden labourers to glamorous film stars, from the delicate-looking but steelwilled Hadiya to fearless young dalit women students, they have repeatedly, persistently, challenged the mainstream consensus on gender justice and social order  despite, mind you, the combined might of the police, the lower judiciary, caste leaders, community authorities, school principals, tearful parents, armies of hostile relatives, sexual offenders in offices, foul-mouthed male hordes online. Maybe history will treat Kadakampallys reference as a compliment, albeit oblique. The writer is a scholar and author.

â€˜Govt must extend facilities to LGBTQâ€™,"NAGPUR: People should first be humane to each other and not judge anyone on the basis of their sexual preferences, said Nikunj Joshi, LGBTQ activist a.",Tnn,28-10-2018,The Times of India,"NAGPUR: People should first be humane to each other and not judge anyone on the basis of their sexual preferences, said Nikunj Joshi, LGBTQ activist and CEO of Saarthi Trust on Wednesday. Speaking at a panel discussion on Homosexuality: Changing attitude: Supreme Court and Society, organized by Press Club of Nagpur in the wake of the historic Supreme Court judgment to decriminalize gay sex. Though section 377 has been struck down, there still exists a social stigma around homosexuals and transgenders. This could be wiped out by creating awareness as people usually confuse gender with sexuality. Like heterosexuals, our sexuality or sexual orientation is part of our personal life none of which should define us, said Joshi. LGBTQ community should also start wearing their sexuality on sleeves and shed inhibitions of being different, he added. Transgender activist Vidya Kamble, former major and HIV specialist Dr Milind Bhrushundi, MLA Dr Milind Mane and social activist Girish Gandhi participated in the discussion. Talking about transgenders rights, Kamble said, Today, we are struggling for facilities as basic as a public toilet. We dont have basic identification documents and it becomes the basis of rejection on professional front. The SC has passed the judgment but the ground reality is different. The government should extend benefits and include us in education schemes, she said. We have a population of 750 transgenders in the city and proper education and a little support from the society will help us earn daily bread, she added. Dr Bhrushundi spoke about issues a homosexual faces while growing up and the positive effect of the judgment in curbing HIV. A person growing up with different sexual orientation is not just confused about himself but fears facing the society due to stigma. This makes it twice as difficult for him to accept himself and takes a toll on his mental health, he said. He said, HIV is mainly prevalent in two sections of the society  heterosexuals aged between 15-25 years and in LGBTQ community. Fortunately, it has now become easier for us to identify the affected persons and curb it disease. It is easier for homosexuals to accept their ailment, said Bhrushundi.

"Police probe to fix role of railway authorities, others",PUNE : The Pune police have started a probe to fix the responsibility of the railway officials and the contractor in the dismantling of the 40-foot-hi.,Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"PUNE : The Pune police have started a probe to fix the responsibility of the railway officials and the contractor in the dismantling of the 40-foot-high metal hoarding frame, which came crashing down on the road near Juna Bazaar on Friday and killed four persons. Police commissioner K Venkatesham told TOI on Saturday, We have arrested the railway engineer entrusted with the task of removing the hoarding frame on its premises (railway land). We have launched a hunt for the contractor who cut the hoarding frame. We are still probing the case and depending upon the outcome, more action will be taken. Senior inspector M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police said, Our investigation is focused on identifying the railway authorities, who gave the contract, those who were monitoring the work and those responsible for the security of people. We have sought documents from the railway authorities related to the contract and allied details, and will examine the same. Mujawar further said, The railway authorities had given the contract to remove the hoarding frame to a private contractor, who is at large with his employees. Our team visited the residences of the contractor and his employees, but they were not there at home. On the probe related to how the accident occurred, Mujawar said, The frame came crashing down on the autorickshaws and other vehicles on the road with a huge force. The contractors employees had started dismantling the metal frame directly from the bottom instead of removing the upper parts of the structure first. They tied a rope to the metal frame and tried to pull it down towards the railway land. But something went wrong, and the frame swung towards the opposite direction and fell on the road with a catapult effect. The railway authorities did not follow the due diligence, Mujawar said. They could have halted the vehicular movement on the road for a few minutes while removing the structure or executed the task in the night. CP meets civic chief Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham and Pune municipal Corporation (PMC) chief Saurabh Rao had a meeting on Saturday on illegal hoardings in the city. I assured my full support to the civic admininstation in its drive against illegal hoardings. We want to avert such incidents in future, he said.

Contest of one-min films aims to tackle HIV/AIDS stigma,"PANAJI: In order to challenge HIV and AIDS-related stigma and explore its negative impact on people living with HIV, the Human Touch Foundation, a you.",Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: In order to challenge HIV and AIDS-related stigma and explore its negative impact on people living with HIV, the Human Touch Foundation, a youth-led organization that works in the field of HIV is organizing a one-minute film competition on HIV stigma. The theme seeks to do away with HIV and AIDS discrimination in terms of self and social acceptance, access to HIV prevention and treatment services, education and employment opportunities as well as many other aspects of everyday life. HIV and AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refer to negative perceptions and attitudes, misconceptions, prejudice and abuse directed at people living with HIV. Despite the remarkable progress made in advancing HIV science, stigma and discrimination which is founded on the fear surrounding the early AIDS pandemic in the 1980s continues to persist to this day, says founder, Human Touch Foundation, Peter Borges. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are invariably devastating, he adds, stating that some people are shunned by family, friends, community and society, while others face poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, violation of their human rights, and psychological damage. These push people living with HIV and key populations further underground, limiting their access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment and other lifesaving health services, he says. The contest is open to students of higher secondary schools and colleges affiliated to Goa Board and Goa University. The last date to submit the films November 20 by email- getintouch@humantouch.ngo.

State joins forces with private players to eliminate TB,"Around 2000 TB cases are detected each year in Goa, the state tuberculosis officer and chief medical officer of the revised national tuberculosis cont",Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"PANAJI: Around 2000 TB cases are detected each year in Goa, the state tuberculosis officer and chief medical officer of the revised national tuberculosis control programme, Dr Maximiano De Sa said on Friday. Since a very small proportion of the cases detected in the private sector are not notified and brought to the notice of the government, he said it is high time that private and public sector join hands to eliminate TB in the state. Goa has a strong private sector which is 50:50. Many TB patients prefer private doctors, as first point of contact, because of privacy issue. We need strong support from our colleagues in the private sector, in notifying such TB cases, he stated during the state launch of Joint Effort to Eliminate TB (JEET) at Panaji. Notified patients will be offered drugs free of cost supplied by WHO qualified pharma companies which undergo stringent quality check mechanisms. Notified patients will also be provided with associated services like HIV testing, multi drug resistance testing, counseling and chemo prophylaxis he stated. While De Sa highlighted the problem of undiagnosed or inadequately diagnosed and treated TB, he said the emergence of a deadly form of the disease i.e drug resistant TB is a bigger worry. TB spreads very easily because it is airborne and there is already a threat of this drug resistant TB spreading, he stated. He also added that the government of India recently launched a social support scheme to help all TB patients by offering them Rs 500 each month for the entire duration of their treatment i.e 6-8 months and for multi drig resistant TB- 2 years. Around 300 patients in the state have availed of this scheme he stated. The JEET project aims for intensive engagement of private sector to achieve universal access to quality diagnosis and treatment for TB and help the nation in achieving The National Strategic Plan to eliminate TB by 2025.

HIV people with positive attitude,By: Anindita Acharya CHANDIGARH: At the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre of the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) .,Tnn,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"By: Anindita Acharya CHANDIGARH: At the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre of the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) for HIVpositive people, you might notice a woman in her midforties, sitting in a corner, wearing a big smile, engaging in polite conservation with the visitors, scribbling down their profile. She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004. She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners, said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative. There was no happily ever after in Meenas life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive, Meena said. People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less. Network of friendsMeena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Networks president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling. Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother. Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100. CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex, said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years. DiscriminationMeena said: More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years, said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years. The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write universal precaution instead of HIV positive on their hospital cards, so that the chemists dont look at us differently when they see the stamp. Admit our kidsIf our identity is revealed, our children wont get admission in schools, said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. For seven years, no progress, she said.

Per capita alcohol consumption more than doubled in India between 2005-16: WHO,"India News: NEW DELHI: Per capita alcohol consumption in India has more than doubled from 2005 to 2016, according to a report by the WHO.",Pti,07-10-2018,The Times of India,"NEW DELHI: Per capita alcohol consumption in India has more than doubled from 2005 to 2016, according to a report by the WHO. In India, the consumption of alcohol has increased from 2.4 litres in 2005 to 5.7 litres in 2016 with 4.2 litres being consumed by men and 1.5 litre by women, it said. The total alcohol per capita consumption (15+ years) is expected to increase in half of the WHO regions by 2025 and the highest increase is expected in the southeast Asia Region. An increase of 2.2 litres is expected in India alone which represents a large proportion of the total population in this region, the report highlighted. However, increases, although smaller, are also expected in Indonesia and Thailand (with the second- and fourth-largest largest populations). The second-highest increase is projected for the populations of the Western Pacific Region, where the population of China is the largest, with an increase in per capita consumption of 0.9 litres of pure alcohol by 2025. Total alcohol per capita consumption has increased globally after a relatively stable phase between 2000 and 2005. Since then, total per capita consumption rose from 5.5 litres in 2005 to 6.4 litres in 2010 and was still at the level of 6.4 litres in 2016, the report stated. However, diverging trends were noticed in different regions of the world. The harmful use of alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for population health worldwide and has a direct impact on many health-related targets of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), including those for maternal and child health, infectious diseases (HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis), noncommunicable diseases and mental health, injuries and poisonings. In 2016, the harmful use of alcohol resulted in some 3 million deaths (5.3 per cent of all deaths) worldwide and 132.6 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Mortality resulting from alcohol consumption is higher than that caused by diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Among men in 2016, an estimated 2.3 million deaths and 106.5 million DALYs were attributable to the consumption of alcohol. 0.7 million women died and they experienced 26.1 million DALYs attributable to alcohol consumption. The harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions, the report stated. Some 2.3 billion people are current drinkers. Globally more than a quarter (26.5 per cent) of all 1519 year-olds are current drinkers, amounting to 155 million adolescents. The WHO has emphasized on the development, implementation and evaluation of cost-effective interventions for harmful use of alcohol as well as creating, compiling and disseminating scientific information on alcohol use and dependence, and related health and social consequences. The ""Global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol"", negotiated and agreed by WHO Member States in 2010, represents international consensus that reducing the harmful use of alcohol and its associated health and social burden is a public health priority. The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including 10 recommended target areas for policy options and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at country level.

Number of HIV/AIDS cases continues to fall,"The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Viá»‡t Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health.",[],2018-12-03,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITYâ€“ The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Viá»‡t Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health. Minister of Health Nguyá»…n Thá»‹ Kim Tiáº¿n, however, said that more than 8,000 new HIV cases were detected every year. ""Between 3,000 and 4,000 people die due to AIDS each year,"" Tiáº¿n said at a meeting held last Saturday to respond to World AIDS Day and the 2018 national action month on HIV/AIDS prevention (November 11 to December 12). ""The country has nearly 50,000 people with HIV in the community, but does not know their status. These are challenges which we still face,â€� Tiáº¿n said. The rate of HIV infection among users who inject drugs, especially among youth, has seen an upward trend, according to the ministry. The shortage of capital for HIV/AIDS prevention is one of many challenges as the coverage of preventive and treatment services remains limited. Discrimination against people with HIV also continues. â€œHIV/AIDS could break out again if we ignore prevention or have irrational attitudes,â€� Tiáº¿n said. Mary Tarnowka, US Consul General, said that through the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the US government had invested over $800 million to support the HIV/AIDS response in Viá»‡t Nam. Nearly 80,000 people with HIV/AIDS, including more than 2,800 children, had been given life-saving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. â€œViá»‡t Nam has shown global leadership by making the HIV response sustainable through the social health insurance platform. Valued at nearly $6 million, social health insuranceâ€™s first ARV procurement will cover medication for 33 per cent of all ARV treatment patients in 2019,â€� she said. Last Friday, the Ministry of Health, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and global health non-profit organization PATH launched pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services for HIV prevention. PrEP is a way for people, who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of contracting it, to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day as part of a combination HIV prevention strategy. If someone who is on PrEP is exposed to HIV, the medication can work to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection. PrEP is extremely effective when taken correctly, and can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 92 per cent or more. The scaling up of PrEP is essential to Viá»‡t Nam being able to dramatically bend down the curve of new HIV infections, according to the press release from the US Consulate. Dr. Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, director of Vietnam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control, said: â€œWeâ€™re proud that Viá»‡t Nam is the second country in Asia, after Thailand, to roll out PrEP nationwide.â€� â€œPrEP will be made available in 11 provinces by 2020. With a target of 7,300 people enrolled, we aim to provide these services to all those who need them nationwide,â€� Long said. VAAC, USAID, and PATH launched pilot PrEP services in June 2017 through the USAID/PATH Healthy Markets project. Healthy Markets has worked with community groups led by people at risk of HIV, provincial health leaders, private sector partners, and private and public outpatient clinics to provide PrEP for 1,895 people at risk of HIV in HCM City and HÃ  Ná»™i. This includes men who have sex with men, transgender women, and HIV-negative partners of people living with HIV who are not viral load suppressed. PrEP was also made available through a pilot project run by UNAIDS. The USAID/PATH Healthy Markets project has also worked with the World Health Organisation (WHO), UNAIDS and PEPFAR partners to support VAAC to develop a comprehensive package of national policies, guidelines and training materials that will support the scaling up of PrEP. â€“ VNS",Society,"['cases', 'number', 'prep', 'services', 'viá»‡t', 'nam', 'fall', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'prevention', 'risk', 'continues', 'health', 'tiáº¿n']","HCM CITYâ€“ The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Viá»‡t Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health.

HIV increase sparks free tests,The Ministry of Health has asked the northern province of PhÃº Thá»� to conduct HIV/AIDS tests free of charge for local people in Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune and those living in surrounding areas.,[],2018-08-17,vietnamnews.vn,"A delegation from the health ministry visits residents in Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune to inspect HIV/AIDS situation in the area. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Trung KiÃªn PHÃš THá»Œ â€” The Ministry of Health has asked the northern province of PhÃº Thá»� to conduct HIV/AIDS tests free of charge for local people in Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune and those living in surrounding areas. The move comes after an outbreak of HIV in Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune, where 42 residents, including a 18-month-old baby girl, were found to be infected last month. These newly-recorded cases were among 500 residents were tested after two people died of HIV/AIDS disease and four newly-infected cases were reported between February and June. A private health clinic owner, which has been found to operate without permission, was suspected to have shared the same dirty needle to multiple patients, causing the medical disaster. The man denied the allegation. PhD Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, director of the Ministry of Healthâ€™s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said the number of infected people at Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune was high - about 2.5 times higher than the average rate of the country. The situation was serious and immediate measures were needed to control the outbreak, Long said. He said the blood tests for HIV/AIDS infection was simple and could be conducted at patientsâ€™ homes or the communal health centre. Those who were found to be positive with the virus would be consulted, supported and given anti-retrovirus (ARV) medical treatment for free. In reply to suspicions on the possibility of HIV transmission by sharing the same needle, Long said based on the initial investigation, the source of infection in the commune could not be determined. HIV is a chronic disease and takes patients between five and seven years to experience the transition from HIV to AIDS. Among 42 infected patients, some of whom have full blown AIDS, a number visited the private health clinic six months ago. So, it was impossible to conclude the nurse practitioner was the one causing the HIV transmission to all these patients. In order to assess the HIV infection in the commune, the Ministry of Health has asked the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology to conduct a survey and investigate the causes of high transmission rate. However, the task could take several months to complete. It was necessary to consider comprehensive transmission routes and related factors, such as the number of local residents working as migrant labourers in other localities, the number of prostitutes and drug addicts. The task was assigned to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, in collaboration with the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, the World Health Organisation and related agencies in PhÃº Thá»� Province. In addition, the provincial health sector should strengthen education to improve knowledge on HIV/AIDS prevention. Infected patients receiving ARV treatment could stay healthy and have long life. ARVs are provided free of charge at districts or communesâ€™ health clinics. â€” VNS",Society,"['ministry', 'thÆ°á»£ng', 'patients', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'sparks', 'residents', 'transmission', 'increase', 'number', 'free', 'tests', 'health', 'commune']","A delegation from the health ministry visits residents in Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune to inspect HIV/AIDS situation in the area.

HIV testing and treatment for an AIDS-free world,"The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is spread through contaminated blood, unprotected sex, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Healthy skin and other bodily fluids like saliva and tears do not transmit HIV.",[],2018-06-25,vietnamnews.vn,"By Dr Mathieu Nalpas* The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is spread through contaminated blood, unprotected sex, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Healthy skin and other bodily fluids like saliva and tears do not transmit HIV. Six to 10 years after contamination and without treatment, HIV infection leads to AIDS and death by general failure of the immune system. Since antiretroviral therapy treatment became widely available in the late 90s, HIV has become a chronic infection. People on treatment do not die from AIDS anymore and are able to live with the virus for the rest of their lives. However, there is still no vaccine against the virus available today. Since 1981, the HIV epidemic killed 36 million people around the world. In 2016, the total number of infected people stood at 36 million people, while 1.2 million died and 1.8 million were newly infected. Despite these terrible numbers, there is hope for the near future. The end of HIV epidemic is possible to happen within the next few decades. In 2011, Scientists from Switzerland showed that persons living with HIV who were taking effective antiretroviral therapy were not contagious for their sexual partner. The so-called â€œtreatment as preventionâ€� concept became fundamental in the fight against HIV. Therefore, a new consensus emerged â€“ the more people living with HIV will take treatment, the less contagious they will become and the less new contaminations will occur. A maximum of people who are living with HIV and who ignore there status must be tested. If they know they are HIV positive they are more unlikely to continue risky behaviors such as unprotected sex and unsafe intravenous drug injection, and they can access treatment There is strong evidence to show that if enough persons living with HIV know their status by being tested and if enough people get treated, the HIV epidemic could be stopped. It is based on this new hope that international HIV expert institutions have developed a new model of its goals called the 90-90-90 programme. The 90-90-90 programme aims to ensure that 90 per cent of people living with HIV are aware of their infection, 90 per cent of people who know about their infection are given treatment, and 90 per cent of individuals receiving treatment do not have detectable virus in their blood. If these goals are reached, the proportion of HIV-positive individuals who cannot infect others would increase immensely and the current epidemic would then be stopped, in the same way that the measles epidemic in young children was stopped through vaccination. A number of cases would still persist, but the scourge of AIDS would come to an end. Access to generalised HIV testing and treatment are fundamental in reaching that goal. In Viá»‡t Nam, where 260,000 persons live with HIV, the virus has become a public health threat. In addition to that figure, there were 11,000 new infections and 7,800 AIDS-related death in the country in 2016. According to the Ministry of Health, AIDS is one of the top 10 causes of death in Viá»‡t Nam. The majority of Vietnamese living with HIV are residents of large cities and mountainous areas. Drug use through injections is the main mode of transmission in Vietnam and the epidemic remains concentrated in some key population groups, including female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. These population groups face strong stigma and discrimination from their families and society in general, making access to screening and treatment a tough challenge for them. According to social research, recurrent barriers to HIV testing and treatment access in these populations include the dual stigmatisation of homosexuality, prostitution, and drug use with HIV/AIDS, as well as failure to protect patient confidentiality, difficulty for health providers to discuss certain issues such as sexual identity, lack of clear referral pathways and peer support, and low access to services in remote areas. In this context, HIV testing and disclosure of HIV status is often not an option for these persons. In 2014, Viá»‡t Nam was the first country in Asia to adopt and commit to the 90-90-90 target. The Vietnamese government has set a target where 90 per cent of people living with HIV must know their status, 90 per cent of people who know their HIV-positive status must be on treatment and 90 per cent of people on treatment must have undetectable virus in their blood. If this goal can finally be reached in the near future, it will mean the end of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Viá»‡t Nam. â€” Family Medical Practice * Dr. Mathieu Nalpas has been working at Family Medical Practice Ha Noi since 2016.

The health ministry asked localities to improve HIV preventive measures, especially distribution of syringes and condoms to high-risk groups like drug addicts and prostitutes. Methadone programmes will be maintained and expanded to treat drug addicts. Communication activities will strengthen the communityâ€™s awareness and eliminate stigma and discrimination towards people living with HIV/AIDS. To strengthen HIV supervision and detection activities, HIV consultation, test and screening forms will be diversified at medical facilities, community and households. HIV test programmes should be carried out at the district level in mountainous and remote and ethnic minority areas, especially residential clusters with many people living with HIV/AIDS. The health sector encouraged localities to also establish HIV test laboratories at the district level in remote and mountainous regions for early detection of new HIV cases in the area. The ARV treatment programme will be expanded widely as soon as possible to reach HIV carriers. HIV treatment facilities will be strengthened to meet the regulations of the health sector. The expense of ARV drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment will be covered by the health insurance fund from the beginning of 2019, according to the instruction. The ministry also suggested provinces and cities allocate more local budget for HIV/AIDS prevention and control with the goal of providing health insurance cards to all people living with HIV/AIDS.

City takes steps to achieve UN 90-90-90 goals in HIV control,"An additional 2,430 people with HIV were diagnosed in the first six months of the year, an increase of 732 compared to the same period last year, according to the HCM City Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.",[],2018-09-05,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” An additional 2,430 people with HIV were diagnosed in the first six months of the year, an increase of 732 compared to the same period last year, according to the HCM City Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. TiÃªu Thá»‹ Thu VÃ¢n, the centreâ€™s head, told Viá»‡t Nam News Agency that most of these people had had HIV for a rather long time, but had never been tested. In recent years, Viá»‡t Nam has enhanced screening and testing for high-risk people to achieve the UNâ€™s 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020. Under the goals, by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. Ninety per cent of people with a diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, while 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. In the first half of the year, nearly 287,000 people were tested and 95 per cent of them were positive for HIV. They were brought to outpatient examination clinics in the city for treatment. â€œDetecting more people with HIV and taking them to the cityâ€™s treatment programmes is very important because many of them do not know their status and they are at a high risk of transmission to others. They are difficult to access. However, now many of them can be detected, so transmission should stop,â€� VÃ¢n told Viá»‡t Nam News Agency. The city has more than 40,000 people with HIV and nearly 10,000 have not yet been detected because agencies have not had access to them, she said. Dr Nguyá»…n Trung HÃ²a, director of the Preventive Health Centre in GÃ² Váº¥p District, told SÃ i GÃ²n Giáº£i PhÃ³ng (Liberated SÃ i GÃ²n) newspaper that if people with HIV are detected early, they will receive antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in time and be able to live like healthy people. HCM City is one of 30 cities worldwide that were the first to commit to the UN 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020, she said. The US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is the US governmentâ€™s response to the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, has provided sponsorship for the city so that it could reach its goals quickly. The donated funds have been used for peers to access groups of high-risk people such as prostitutes and drug injectors, especially the group of men who have sex with men. It also has been used to buy rapid test kits for HIV detection and other activities related to HIV prevention and control. Moreover, the cityâ€™s agencies have expanded communication to reduce discrimination against people with HIV, VÃ¢n said. The city also will improve quality of preventive and treating services in order to ensure that people with HIV have opportunities for detection and treatment, she added. The city Department of Health has co-operated with the Centre for Reproductive Healthcare to carry out programmes on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV at 58 health facilities for pregnant women. In the first six months of the year, 44,500 pregnant women were provided counselling and testing. At least 93 per cent of pregnant women with HIV received ARV therapy, which helps prevent transmission of the virus to their baby. The womenâ€™s newborns also continue to receive treatment for mother-to-child transmission services. Challenges Currently, patients with HIV receive free treatment, but next year they will have to cover the costs as funding for treatment is drying up from international sources. Health insurance will cover the costs, but 10 per cent of these patients do not have health insurance. VÃ¢n said this was a challenge for the UN 90-90-90 goals. If no financial sponsorship can be found, the city will spend part of its budget to buy health insurance cards for people with HIV. Another challenge is the upward trend of HIV drug resistance among people with HIV, with the rate of 6 per cent to 7 per cent who have HIV. The cost for treatment for people with HIV drug resistance is five or 10 times higher than normal treatment, VÃ¢n said, adding that non-adherence to treatment regimens results in resistance. To improve surveillance and treatment, the city plans to strengthen co-ordination with other neighbouring provinces and cities in HIV prevention and control to avoid losing contact with people with HIV. â€” VNS",Society,"['treatment', 'goals', 'city', 'vÃ¢n', 'hiv', '909090', 'steps', 'takes', 'transmission', 'cent', 'prevention', 'control', 'achieve', 'health', 'therapy']","In recent years, Viá»‡t Nam has enhanced screening and testing for high-risk people to achieve the UNâ€™s 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020.

Residents of Kim ThÆ°Æ¡Ì£ng Commune in TÃ¢n SÆ¡n District will receive free screening and free HIV/AIDS treatment if they test positive, Dr HoÃ ng Ä�iÌ€nh CaÌ‰nh, deputy head of Viá»‡t Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), said. Yesterday morning, a working group â€“ including health ministry officials and doctors from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology â€“ arrived at the scene to investigate and calm residents. HÃ  Káº¿ San, vice chairman of PhÃº Thá»� Peopleâ€™s Committee told the media that there were 42 HIV cases newly recorded at Kim ThÆ°á»£ng Commune out of nearly 500 who underwent HIV testing after the rumours started. â€œThe HIV/AIDS authority deemed the rate to be quite high in a population of 6,000, but not especially so, since there are at least 61 communes in the country with even higher rate of HIV/AIDS infection,â€� San said in a press conference held yesterday afternoon. San said it is still too early to determine the reason behind this high infection rate, but the health ministry has already started working on the case. â€œThe most important point is to provide counselling and support for the unfortunate patients. We must ensure that the people are aware of the fact that there are now treatment methods for the disease, the Government-supplied anti-retrovirus ARV can enable a healthy long life,â€� San said. The counselling is supposed to be done first before telling the patients of their situation as well as treatment. â€œThe investigation is not easy and needs a lot of time. Based on our previous experience in similar incidents, it will take as long as two months to arrive at a definitive conclusion,â€� Dr CaÌ‰nh told Vietnam News Agency. Kim ThÆ°á»£ng is an underdeveloped locality, with MÆ°á»�ng ethnicity people making up 85 per cent of the population. In recent weeks, the quiet commune descended into panic as several people needed to take HIV tests, after a middle-aged female tested positive for the virus. She said she had gone to the private residence of nurse-practitioner HÃ  Tráº§n Tháº£o, who is currently working at TÃ¢n SÆ¡n General Hospital, to get an injection. Rumours started circulating that Tháº£o might have reused dirty needles on multiple patients, resulting in the spread of infection, however, in a written statement, Tháº£o denied the allegations. The mass blood tests were part of a research on communicable and non-communicable diseases in the community conducted by TÃ¢n SÆ¡n health clinic and not mass HIV tests, according to authorities. The results of the survey have not been publicly made available as they contain sensitive and private information. â€œGiven the travelling difficulties and scattered clusters of residence in the commune, locals often opted to visit houses of doctors residing in the area instead of going to proper health clinics.

Until now they could only go to the health facility registered in their health insurance card. If they wanted to go to other places including higher-level hospitals, they had to obtain a transfer order from the facility. The new system makes it easier for them to their hospital of choice, Dr Nguyá»…n Giá»�i, deputy head of the province HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre, said. The provinceâ€™s website cites the case of a woman from VÄ©nh Cá»­u District who tested positive for HIV eight years ago and developed pneumonia and candidiasis and needed to go to a province-level hospital for treatment. It took a long time to get the transfer paper from the BiÃªn HÃ²a city Preventive Health Centre, she complained. Two medical facilities, the province HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre and the Long KhÃ¡nh town Health Centre, have yet to sign up for the new system with Viá»‡t Nam Social Security, but are expected to come on board this month. Dr TrÆ°Æ¡ng VÄƒn Ráº¡ng, deputy head of the latter, said the centre has all the facilities needed to examine and treat people with HIV/AIDS. It now provides free ant-retroviral (ARV) drugs to 412 people with HIV/AIDS. Dr Nguyá»…n Thi VÄƒn VÄƒn, head of the Long ThÃ nh District Health Centre, said the ARV drugs are sponsored by the Global Fund and provided free. The Global Fund is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector and people affected by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, designed to accelerate the end of the diseases as epidemics. Of 486 people with HIV treated at her centre, VÄƒn said 112 do not have health insurance cards. The Ministry of Health has warned that if health facilities do not sign up with Viá»‡t Nam Social Security to cover HIV treatment for insured people, the province would have to cover the cost of ARV therapy for them and the Global Fund would stop its assistance from next year. Ä�á»“ng Nai Province has seen a decrease in the incidence of new HIV cases in recent years from more than 300 in 2015 to 200 last year and 60 so far this year. But the incidence among men who have sex with men has increased sharply. As of the beginning of this month the province has issued for free health insurance cards to more than 2,600 people with HIV/AIDS. It is likely to issue another 300 soon.

This is because international aid, which covers all medical fees for people with HIV, will cease, according to the Nong thon ngay nay (Countryside Today) newspaper. The funding stoppage will be fully introduced in 2017 because Viet Nam has now been classed as a middle-income country. Until then, international aid will cease for new cases. Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the Health Ministrys Administration of HIV/AIDS Control said ARV drugs could suppress the HIV virus, stop the progression of HIV and reduce HIV infections in the community. Long said about 98,000 people with HIV had received free ARV treatment in the country to date. He said it cost about VND420 billion (US$19 million) a year to treat 98,000 people with HIV. Thus, the cost for medical treatment fee for one person treated with ARV was about VND4 million (US$181) a year. In response to the situation, the health ministry has issued circular no 15/2015/TT-BYT saying that the health insurance agency will cover all costs for ARV treatment, but only for pregnant woman and children under the age of six with HIV. The circular added that from 2017, the agency would cover 80 to 95 per cent of medical fees for ARV treatment for other people. They will have to contribute about 5-20 per cent of total fees. Do Thi Nhan, head of the departments HIV/AIDS Examination and Care Office said that this was a significant effort by the national health sector. Grant support The US Agency for International Development (USAID) yesterday launched the Healthy Markets Innovation Fund to support innovative social enterprise ideas for HIV-related commodities and services in Viet Nam. The fund offers opportunities for organisations, non-profits, and businesses in Viet Nam to engage in HIV response by contributing and investing in innovative ideas to increase the supply of HIV goods and services. Promising ideas chosen by a panel of HIV and social impact experts will compete for award packages of financial and in-kind support, such as business mentoring and technical assistance for implementation. ""The Healthy Markets Innovation Fund is a new exciting opportunity to engage and support private sector and community entrepreneurs with enterprising ideas that can contribute to the HIV response,"" she said. The fund is implemented under the umbrella of Healthy Markets, a five-year project that aims to leverage private sector and social enterprise skills, resources, and innovation to contribute to a sustained HIV response for populations facing the greatest risks. About 80 per cent of funding for HIV response in Viet Nam comes from external donors. Domestic resources are declining as international donors withdraw from Viet Nam. Finding alternative sources to maintain the provision of HIV related goods and services is crucial.

PrEP is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs, which, if taken daily as prescribed, can reduce the risk of HIV infection by 92-99 per cent for people who are at high risk, including men who have sex with men, transgender women, and HIV-negative partners of those diagnosed with HIV. Since 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended the use of PrEP as part of a combination HIV prevention strategy that includes the use of condoms for people at substantial risk of HIV. Since March 2017, pilot interventions supported by the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through USAID/PATHâ€™s Healthy Markets project and the US Agency for International Development (AID) through the Centre for Applied Research for Men And Community Health have made PrEP available to men who have sex with men, transgender women, and HIV-negative partners of those diagnosed with HIV in HCM City and HÃ  Ná»™i, according to VÅ© Ngá»�c Báº£o of USAID/PATHâ€™s Healthy Markets project. These PrEP services are being provided by public outpatient clinics, private clinics and associated key population-led civil society organisations, Báº£o said at a workshop reviewing the PrEP programme held yesterday in HCM City. Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, director of VAAC, said that results had enabled VAAC to collaborate with all partners to expand PrEP services, starting with 11 cities with a target of 5,610 PrEP clients by the end of 2019 and 7,300 by the end of 2020. â€œPrEP is a game-changer for Viá»‡t Nam in its efforts to achieve the 90-90-90 goals,â€� said Mei Mei Peng, deputy director of USAIDâ€™s Health Department. The numbers mean 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. USAID supports Viá»‡t Nam, the second country to adopt PrEP in Southeast Asia, to expand options for people at risk of HIV to protect themselves and work toward HIV elimination, she said. Methadone therapy Huá»³nh Thanh Khiáº¿t, deputy director of the cityâ€™s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affair, said HIV prevalence among high-risk groups, including drug users, men who have sex with men, prostitutes, remained high. Last year, the city reported more than 5,800 new HIV infections, Khiáº¿t said at a meeting held on Monday (May 28) in HCM City. The rising number of young addicts taking methamphetamine and other types of drugs poses challenges for rehab programmes and management of former addicts, Khiáº¿t said. More than 9,500 drug addicts are taking part in detoxification and rehabilitation programmes at rehabilitation facilities in the city and more than 1,300 addicts are undergoing rehab at home. The city is home to 19 State-owned and three private rehab facilities offering compulsory and voluntary rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts. Nguyá»…n Thá»‹ Kim Tiáº¿n, Minister of Health, said the city had made constant efforts to manage drug addicts who do not have residential permits. However, the cost of detoxification and rehabilitation for injections is high, while relapse is common, Tiáº¿n said. The city should learn from rehabilitation models in other countries and use the services of the private sector to operate voluntary rehabilitation models. Methadone maintenance therapy remains a key approach to help addicts quit their use of drugs and it should be expanded to wards and communes, she said. She said that rehab facilities should take into account the 90-90-90 treatment target by UNAIDS.

HIV/AIDs treatment costs to spike,"People with HIV and AIDS are expecting medical costs to soar when international health aid is cut off next year, participants at a policy dialogue said yesterday.",[],2016-06-28,vietnamnews.vn,"People with HIV/AIDS receives consulting at a medical station. People with HIV and AIDS are expecting medical costs to soar when international health aid is cut off next year. â€” Photo kenh13.info HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” People with HIV and AIDS are expecting medical costs to soar when international health aid is cut off next year, participants at a policy dialogue said yesterday. Further complicating the issue, this demographic has found it difficult to secure health insurance. The dialogue on a health insurance policy for people living with HIV/AIDS was co-organised by The Viá»‡t Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations and the Health Ministryâ€™s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control. Health insurance is expected to be a life preserver for HIV/AIDS patients in Viá»‡t Nam, particularly when international aid, which covers almost all medical fees for HIV-positive patients in the country, will cease next year because Viá»‡t Nam has now been categorised as a middle-income country. Deputy head of the AIDS Department HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh said that when HIV/AIDS patients pay for health insurance, they would be held accountable to the medical treatment scheme. As a result, they would avoid skipping treatment or shifting to other medical treatment schemes, which are usually more expensive, he said. Trá»‹nh Thá»‹ LÃª TrÃ¢m, director of the HÃ  Ná»™i-based Centre for Law, Healthcare and HIV/AIDS Policies under the Viá»‡t Nam Bar Association, said HIV/AIDS patients are usually poor, unemployed or have unstable incomes. â€œThey usually fail to afford health insurance cards, and they need significant medical care to treat opportunistic infections in addition to their anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment,â€� TrÃ¢m said. Despite the fact that under the Law on Health Insurance, poor households were granted free health insurance cards and near-poor households had to pay only half of health insurance fees, people with HIV/AIDS still struggled to gain health insurance coverage. Ä�á»— Ä�Äƒng Ä�Ã´ng, a representative from the Viá»‡t Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (VNP+), said that besides administrative difficulties in applying for health insurance, societal stigma and discrimination were major barriers that prevented HIV/AIDS carriers from seeking insurance. Those who left their hometowns to live in other localities also find it difficult to obtain insurance because only residents with permanent or temporary registration can apply for health insurance, he said. HIV/AIDS children born overseas to mothers who were trafficked or married foreigners could not apply for health insurance either because they did not have birth certificates, he added. Ä�Ã´ng said that many people with HIV/AIDS also suffer from cancers that require expensive medicines. Under a circular issued by the Health Ministry guiding the revised Law on Health Insurance, 25 types of expensive medicines used to treat cancer were paid for by both health insurance agencies and patients, Ä�Ã´ng said, adding that it was a big burden for HIV/AIDS patients. An HIV/AIDS carrier in HÃ  Ná»™iâ€™s Gia LÃ¢m District said he had to take a medicine that cost VNÄ�1.35 million (US$60.70) daily to prevent the development of cancer cells. Previously, health insurance paid for the medicine in whole, but since 2015 he has paid half, which created a large financial burden for him and his family, he said. â€”VNS",Society,"['medical', 'spike', 'patients', 'viá»‡t', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'usually', 'costs', 'paid', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","The dialogue on a health insurance policy for people living with HIV/AIDS was co-organised by The Viá»‡t Nam Union of Science and Technology Associations and the Health Ministryâ€™s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control.

VN contestant raises HIV awareness,Miss Universe Viá»‡t Nam Hâ€™Hen Nie has called for reducing stigma and discrimination against HIV patients at the Miss Universe 2018 contest that is now being held in Bangkok.,[],2018-12-04,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” Miss Universe Viá»‡t Nam Hâ€™Hen Nie has called for reducing stigma and discrimination against HIV patients at the Miss Universe 2018 contest that is now being held in Bangkok. Hâ€™Hen Nie is participating in the United Nationsâ€™ Global Campaign on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as part of the effort to create â€œa red ribbon waveâ€� at this yearâ€™s beauty pageant. By wearing a red ribbon on her arms during the beauty event, which ends on December 17, Hâ€™Hen Nie is showing her support to the campaign. â€œWith support from the international community at the Miss Universe contest this year, I do believe in a more civilised attitude for the future of the community of HIV/AIDS patients,â€� she told Viá»‡t Nam News. The campaign, which marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day (December 1), aims to protect patients and stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. Since being crowned Miss Universe Viá»‡t Nam last year, Hâ€™Hen Nie, who is from the ÃŠ Ä�Ãª ethnic group of the Central Highlands province of Ä�áº¯k Láº¯k, has taken part in many social activities, especially those related to HIV/AIDS. Hâ€™Hen Nie has also been involved in the U=U campaign (undetectable=untransmittable) funded by the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The U=U statement has been recognised or endorsed by more than 782 medical and community-based organisations in more than 95 countries. The statement builds on evidence-based research demonstrating that HIV treatment is highly effective in reducing HIV transmission and that people living with HIV on ARV (antiretroviral) treatment with an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexual transmission. Viá»‡t Nam has consistently shown strong leadership in responding to HIV in the world and the region. In recent years, Viá»‡t Nam has enhanced screening and testing for high-risk people to achieve the UNâ€™s 90-90-90 goals in HIV prevention and control by 2020. Under the goals, by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status. Ninety per cent of people with a diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained ARV therapy, while 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Viá»‡t Nam continued to be under control this year, with a reduction in new incidences of HIV/AIDS and mortality from AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health. Speaking at a recent meeting to respond to World AIDS Day, Nguyá»…n Thá»‹ Kim Tiáº¿n, health minister, said more than 8,000 new HIV cases were detected every year in Viá»‡t Nam. â€œThe country still has nearly 50,000 people with HIV who do not know their status. These are challenges which we still face,â€� she said. The rate of HIV infection among users who inject drugs, especially among youth, has seen an upward trend, according to the ministry.

Now, the countryâ€™s efforts to fight the disease are running into financial obstacles as aid from international organisationsâ€”the key funding source for HIV/AIDS preventionâ€”runs out. Ä�á»— Há»¯u Thá»§y, Director of Media and Community Mobilisation Department under Ministry of Health (MoH) tells Lao Ä�á»™ng Cuá»‘i tuáº§n (Labour Weekend) newspaper about the issue. Viá»‡t Nam is confronting several difficulties in HIV/AIDS prevention with the decrease of international assistance. What do you think about this issue? In the near future, international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention will be cut. Three assistance projects operated by Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be withdrawn by the end of 2017. Additionally, the United States Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has announced that it will stop offering services by the end of 2018 and only support us with technical issues. At present, we are requesting money from the Global Fund since several international projects will end their service assistance, putting more burden on the AIDS fight in Viá»‡t Nam. How does the MoH deal with this situation? Since 2013, the ministry has consulted the government developing financial plans for HIV/AIDS prevention. We recommend the Government effectively mobilise domestic resources including the State budget, local budgets and socialised sources. On the other hand, the Government is encouraged to seek and maintain international aid if possible. Additionally, it is necessary to identify and focus on priority groups. In the context of reduced support, the efficient use of resources is especially important. Besides, the government has directed local authorities to make their own financial plans for HIV/AIDS prevention. Until now, more than 50 provinces have had their plans approved while only 8 others are building or proposing plans. Some provinces have allocated sufficient resources to maintain treatment practices, but it is not always sufficient. However, we recognise their efforts in the AIDS fight. The Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) has conducted several field trips in some provinces of the Cá»­u Long River Delta, one of the countryâ€™s areas most affected by AIDS. What do you think about their work on HIV/AIDS prevention? We just came back from two field trips in Cáº§n ThÆ¡ City and Báº¿n Tre Province. They are sharing some common issues in the AIDS fight. Unlike in the North, in Cá»­u Long River Deltaâ€™s provinces, HIV/AIDS is commonly transmitted through sexual contact. For example, in Cáº§n ThÆ¡ City and Báº¿n Tre Province, 80 per cent of people are infected due to unsafe sex. Therefore, the two provinces need to promote practicing safe sex, including the use of condoms. Besides organic drugs such as heroin or morphine, synthetic drugs are increasingly being abused, especially among the youth. While methadone can be used to treat opioid dependence, there is no treatment offered to synthetic drug abusers. Moreover, synthetic drug abusers experience illusions, leading to the loss of control and unsafe sex. According to a report by VAAC, gay and bisexual groups (MSM) in the two provinces are witnessing an increase in HIV-infected people. We have not yet controlled HIV transmission through sex acts in this group. How is HIV/AIDS prevention in the two provinces? We think that both localities have made huge efforts in preventing HIV. However, Cáº§n ThÆ¡ City has been enjoying more favourable conditions since it is the key area of the drug fight in Southern provinces. The city has received support from international organisations to enhance human resources and infrastructure for fighting against HIV/AIDS. Báº¿n Tre Province does not have these opportunities; however, it has efficiently implemented prevention solutions, including public communications, preventive treatment for mother-to-child transmission and voluntary counselling and testing. â€“ VNS",Society,"['running', 'international', 'city', 'resources', 'viá»‡t', 'hivaids', 'sources', 'prevention', 'aids', 'tre', 'funding', 'treatment', 'provinces']","Now, the countryâ€™s efforts to fight the disease are running into financial obstacles as aid from international organisationsâ€”the key funding source for HIV/AIDS preventionâ€”runs out.

What has been prepared to ensure health insurance coverage for HIV treatment expenses? The health insurance fund along with other State budget sources have been contributing to ensuring HIV drug supplies. The health insurance fund has so far covered HIV opportunistic infections and other testing for HIV patients who hold health insurance cards. It is estimated that by the end of this year, about 48,000 HIV patients who hold health insurance cards will have their ARV drug covered by the fund. The rest of the patients will be covered by 2020. Viá»‡t Nam Social Security (VSS) has worked with the health ministry to sign healthcare contracts with HIV treatment facilities and set up a database to manage patients who are on ARV. The VSS and the health ministry also provide ARV drugs to HIV treatment facilities. The health insurance fund covers a first-class ARV treatment regimen. It is estimated that more than VNÄ�600 billion (US$25.5 million) is needed to provide treatment for more than 100,000 HIV/AIDS patients. What solutions should be taken to ensure health insurance coverage for them? It is estimated to cost VNÄ�6 million ($255) per year to provide healthcare check-ups and treatment for each HIV patient. We need solutions to ensure the fund is capable of covering health insurance card holders including HIV patients. We need to step up management on using the insurance fund in an effective way. Quality and prices of drugs, management and use must be ensured. We should make plans to adjust health insurance premiums and taxes on alcohol and cigarettes to contribute to the health insurance fund. How are you planning to convince more HIV patients to sign up for the health insurance programme in order to ensure better treatment for them? Viá»‡t Nam is now the only country mobilising domestic sources for HIV/AIDS treatment. The VSS and the health ministry have created the most favourable conditions for HIV patients to access health insurance. The number of HIV patients who hold health insurance card holders has increased. The coverage rate for HIV patients in many localities has reached 100 per cent. However, the health insurance coverage rate in some localities remains low because patients are afraid of being discriminated against and do not want to reveal their personal information. The VSS and the health ministry will step up communication campaigns on HIV and ARV patients to share the importance of health insurance. We expect authorities will continue to improve HIV treatment service quality and create a friendly environment for HIV carriers by changing medical staffâ€™s attitudes towards patients as well as their consultation and communication skills.

He told a consultation workshop on developing a National Action Plan to eliminate the mother-to-child transmission of such diseases in the 2018-30 period, co-organised by Ministry of Healthâ€™s Maternal and Child Health Department in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO). Tiáº¿n said that the goal of complete elimination of mother-to-child transmission of these diseases is clear, and the whole health sector is working to make it happen. ""The transmission of these diseases from mother to child causes many consequences, greatly affecting the health of mothers and children,"" Tiáº¿n said. The department reported that the rate of HIV infection among the countryâ€™s two million pregnant women every year is 0.25 per cent. At the same time, Viá»‡t Nam is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of hepatitis B virus in the world, at 10-20 per cent, according to the health ministry. Therefore, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus among pregnant women is also high. According to the Central Dermatology Hospital â€™s latest report, the incidence of congenital syphilis in newborns is on the rise. A draft on the National Action Plan to eliminate the transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis from mother to child in the 2018-30 period has been completed by the Ministry of Health. The plan will focus on key solutions: strengthening communication and finance, innovating new methods of treatment and enhancing the quality of health services such as screening, diagnosis, care and treatment for mothers and children. At the workshop, participants discussed issues such as antenatal care and pre-testing for disease discovery, interventions for pregnant women, mother-to-child transmission, funding for the implementation of the plan, inter-sector coordination and monitoring. According to WHO, in the western Pacific Region, every year, about 180,000 people are infected with hepatitis B, 13,000 children are infected with syphilis and 1,400 children are infected with HIV. These diseases can be prevented through simple and accessible interventions, including pre-testing for pregnant women and vaccination of infants after birth. Participants at the workshop agreed that in Viá»‡t Nam , there is a lack of coordination between medical service providers such as clinics, hospitals and grass-roots health centres.

Dr TrÆ°Æ¡ng Há»¯u Khanh, the departmentâ€™s head, told Viá»‡t Nam News that the mothers were not provided counselling about HIV tests during pregnancy. Many of them were examined periodically at private health facilities, he said. â€œIf they know their HIV status, they are prescribed medicines during pregnancy and childbirth, which can prevent more than 98 per cent of mother-to-child transmission of HIV,â€� he added. The programme for prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been carried out since 2005, Nguyá»…n Ä�á»©c Vinh, head of the Ministry of Healthâ€™s maternal and child health department, said. Vinh spoke at a conference on a national action plan on eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis by 2030, held in HCM City on Wednesday. The rate of women receiving HIV screening before and during pregnancy is 38.5 per cent, while the rate of pregnant women receiving HIV tests during labour is 57.6 per cent. The country has nearly 2 million pregnant women every year, and of those, more than 3,800 have HIV. Between 1,140 and 1,520 children are born from women infected with HIV. Health staffâ€™s counselling on HIV tests and other issues related to HIV for pregnant women is limited, according to Vinh. In addition, health insurance does not cover the fee for HIV tests, and there are not enough free HIV tests to serve demand. Many pregnant women are afraid of discrimination if they test positive for HIV, Vinh said. The rate of pregnant women infected with hepatitis B accounts for 10 per cent to 20 per cent of all pregnant women. Ninety per cent of children born from these women will be infected with hepatitis B. The Ministry of Health has plans to improve health care at grassroots-level health facilities with better communication and broader access to preventive services related to HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis. The rate of mother-to-child syphilis transmission is 40 per cent to 70 per cent, while the rate of pregnant women getting syphilis tests accounts for only around 16 per cent. Tests for the three diseases will be included in pregnancy examinations at grassroots-level health facilities. This will help the country eliminate mother-to-child HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis transmission by 2030. â€” VNS",Society,"['rate', 'tested', 'women', 'hiv', 'mothertochild', 'hepatitis', 'transmission', 'health', 'low', 'cent', 'tests', 'pregnant']","The rate of women receiving HIV screening before and during pregnancy is 38.5 per cent, while the rate of pregnant women receiving HIV tests during labour is 57.6 per cent.

Speaking yesterday at a HÃ  Ná»™i workshop on the importance of mainstreaming gender into HIV work, Shoko Ishikawa, UN Women Country Representative said women and girls living with HIV ""now face extraordinary, and often intersecting, forms of discrimination. Many face losing their home, custody of their children and property and inheritance rights.â€� Women who engaged in sex work also suffer high levels of discrimination, she said. In 2014 an estimated 240,000 adults were living with HIV in Viá»‡t Nam. Although the number of new infections had remained high at 14,000 a year, the proportion of infected women increased from one in four in 2007 to one in three by 2014. More than half of women living with HIV reported their only possible exposure to HIV being through a husband or long-term sex partner who had engaged in high-risk behaviour, according to the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC). VAAC deputy general director Pháº¡m Ä�á»©c Máº¡nh said there is ""limited awareness and legal and policy framework which focus on women and girls living with HIV at the moment.â€� â€œOnly very few existing indicators are women-focused, and the review system focuses on quantitative data and case studies, which provide quite limited insights into the response of women, and more generally, the quality and effectiveness of the programme. Together with the lack of gender knowledge, these are becoming major barriers to an effective national response to HIV,â€� he said. In Viá»‡t Nam, sexual transmission is the most common means of transmission of HIV. Half of all people who were infected with HIV in 2014 were infected sexually compared to one in 10 in 2000. But only 40 per cent of young women have accurate knowledge about preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, according to the VAAC. The VAAC is now revising the HIV National Work Plan 2016-20 and preparing 2017 work plans. 12,000 free tests The HCM City-based Centre for Promotion of Quality of Life (LIFE) is providing 12,000 sets of rapid HIV tests free to high-risk groups, including men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women, drug users and prostitutes via community-based organisations. Counseling on the free service is provided via the centreâ€™s hotline 0943 108 138 and community-based organisations. The service is a part of the international PATH organisationâ€™s Healthy Markets project, a five-year initiative which aims to provide a viable market for HIV-related goods and services capable of meeting the needs of populations facing the greatest risks. The service is funded by the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). At the end of August, the Ministry of Health in co-operation with the US Embassy officially launched the first-ever HIV self-testing services, which use oral fluids, in Viá»‡t Nam. Last December, counselling and rapid testing for HIV that takes blood from a personâ€™s finger was provided free to MSM and transgender women in a pilot programme. These activities are efforts of the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control and the US government to increase access to HIV tests among high-risk groups in the country. The groups can self test or receive assistance from the staff of community-based organisations who are trained in testing and will maintain patientsâ€™ confidentiality. The rapid HIV tests have helped reduce overcrowding at health facilities, according to the centre.

According to Viá»‡t Namâ€™s Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, from 2015, the anti-retroviral drugs were usually provided as drug aid by foreign organisations, including US government-backed Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as support from the Clinton Foundation. Since these organisations have run programmes to provide ARV drugs in large amounts to a lot of countries over a long time, in order to ensure the same quality of drugs for all recipient countries, they would bulk purchase from the producers for a slightly better price. From 2015, to make sure that the supply of ARV drugs would not be interrupted, the Government has tasked the health ministry with procuring ARV drugs, using the State budget. Viá»‡t Namâ€™s Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, with the help of international organisations, has managed to negotiate and win bids to buy ARV drugs in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. In 2016, for the first time ever, the department bought 6.4 million 3-in-1 ARV pills â€“ a single one of these 1200mg pills would contain the three types of medications that patients needed â€“ for the price of VNÄ�7.299, or US$0.32 (5 per cent VAT already included). Viá»‡t Nam has managed to secure a better deal, buying the pills 16.6 per cent cheaper compared with the Global Fundâ€™s purchase price of $0.3681, or 17.8 cheaper against the purchase price of PEPFARâ€™s $0.3728. Moving on to 2017, Viá»‡t Nam managed to buy 3 million 3-in-1 ARV pills at an even lower price, $0.268, 15 per cent cheaper compared to 2016 and still lower than the purchase prices from the two abovementioned aid agencies.

Khmer soldier adopts comradeâ€™s HIV-infected kid,"Despite fully knowing that HIV/AIDS, dangerous as it may be, can not be easily transmitted just by touching or direct talking, but in most peopleâ€™s minds, itâ€™s better just to stay as far away from the â€˜doomedâ€™ patients. Worse, those open-minded unaffiliated ones who donâ€™t shy away from such common â€˜interactionsâ€™ with HIV/AIDS patients could, in turn, face some wariness from the less open-minded crowds.",[],2017-12-28,vietnamnews.vn,"Lá»¥c TÃ¹ng KIÃŠN GIANG â€” Most people know now that HIV/AIDS cannot be transmitted easily. They know that it cannot spread by merely touching or talking to an infected person. However, the ostracism of people with HIV/AIDS has persisted in Vietnamese society, despite many awareness campaigns, as people adopt a better safe than sorry attitude. Not only do such people decide itâ€™s better to stay as far away from the â€œdoomedâ€� people, they are even wary of those who interact normally with HIV/AIDS infected people. The fear and ostracism is even more difficult to overcome in rural areas where misunderstandings and fear continue to surround the condition. Danh TrÆ°Æ¡Ì€ng Danh, a Khmer solider, is an exception. The resident of the Mekong Delta Province of KiÃªn Giang has braved all the ostracism and fears, adopting two children, one with HIV, of a comrade who succumbed to the dreaded disease. Not only has Danh adopted the children, he has lavished as much care on them as his own offspring, if not more. The Khmer border guard looks older than his 50-something years, the tough life having taken its toll, but a smile never deserts his face. He happily introduces the joys of his life, the two adopted orphans, the boy, Quá»‘c Báº£o, and the younger girl, K.C. â€“ to anyone visiting his humble home. â€œK.C. is in 9th grade, and Quá»‘c Báº£o has grown into quite a beefy man. He now works with the military command of GÃ nh Dáº§u Commune.â€� It is hard for anyone to believe that the healthy-looking secondary school student was at deathâ€™s door 14 years ago, with everyone assuming she had no chance to survive. â€œThe whole thing started in 2004. I adopted the children after my comrade died of AIDS. At my commanding officerâ€™s suggestion, I got blood tests done at the provincial hospital. It was very painful to learn that K.C. was in the final stage of AIDS.â€� At the final stage of the â€˜disease of the centuryâ€™ where the bodyâ€™s immune system is heavily compromised - boils, scabs, swellings and wounds oozing blood and yellow puss start to pop up more frequently and do not heal. Danh was not put off. He still bathed her, washed her clothes, taught her, took her to school, and hugged her tightly to calm her down during nights when her body was racked by searing pain. Reminiscing about those difficult days, Danh said be believes his love and unwavering care for his child carried her through. It was not just taking care of her daily needs, medicines or treatment, it was giving her the will to live, though love. Overcoming discrimination â€œOne must really understand the social context and Danhâ€™s own family situation back then to fully appreciate the silent sacrifices Danh has made,â€� said Major DÆ°Æ¡ng Thanh HoÃ ng, deputy political commissar of the border post and Danhâ€™s colleague. In the rural community they are based in, understanding of HIV/AIDS was really limited. In addition, just four days before K.C.â€™s biological father breathed his last, Danhâ€™s own first-born son, Danh TrÆ°á»�ng Quá»‘c, 12 years old then, drowned in a stream on his way home. Danhâ€™s wife, LÃª Thá»‹ Ngá»�c BÃ­ch, was also expecting, and the child was just a few months away. In the midst of such a tragedy, no one would have Danh to keep a promise he made to his dying comrade, and have the children, whoâ€™d also lost their mother to AIDS, cared for by an orphanage. Danh, however, welcomed the two children into his family despite his personal grief. â€œOf course, bringing up two additional children began a period of serious struggle for me,â€� Danh said. Since depending on support from relatives on both his and his wifeâ€™s side was not a long-term solution, since nobody was very well off, the couple decided to open a small groceries store. After K.C. tested positive for HIV/AIDS, Danh had to seek support from colleagues to cover medical treatment for the little girl. But misfortune never comes singly. When word got around that the adopted daughter was an HIV/AIDS patient, people in the area practically shunned the coupleâ€™s store. Witnessing Danhâ€™s struggle, many advised him to send K.C. to an HIV/AIDS centre, where she would be cared for by professional medical workers and the â€œburden on his family would be lifted.â€� Danh confessed that at first, he thought it was actually a sound idea, and did some preparations. But, in the end, he changed his mind. â€œSeeing her own relatives, my relatives, the community at large, all shunning her, I felt like I was the last emotional support for her. If I failed her, no medicine could possibly help her,â€� Danh said. So he continued to tirelessly do his official work and take care of the girl. Countless times Danh had to cross the forest in the middle of night to get from GÃ nh Dáº§u post to the provincial hospital when K.C. caught raging fevers. Promise to a dying comrade â€œItâ€™s comradeship that pulled me through,â€� Danh said. Born to a working Khmer family in GÃ² Quao District of KiÃªn Gaing Province, Danh easily made friends with other officers, the majority of whom shared his poor background. When one of them, D.T.G., was on his deathbed, he pleaded with Danh to take care of Quá»‘c Báº£o and K.C., and the friend followed through the promise, even managing to convince his wife and biological children to help him care for the two adopted ones. When his biological daughter grew up and K.C.â€™s health started to stabilise after gaining access to ARV therapy under the national HIV/AIDS care and treatment programme, Danhâ€™s wife BÃ­ch could go work for an aquaculture company. When the fishing season ended, she took up all sorts of odds-and-ends jobs, including opening up a makeshift â€˜daycare centreâ€™ right at her home to care for local children, to share the financial burden with Danh. Fortunately, since K.C.â€™s health has gotten better, locals are no longer shunning the family. Danhâ€™s family is still poor and barely making ends meet, but a certain sense of reassuring stability has come. However, the future is still rife with uncertainties. As Viá»‡t Nam has entered the middle-income group of countries, international support for HIV/AIDS treatment, which has allowed patients to enjoy free medicines â€“ has started to dwindle. Now, treatment and medicines will be available only through the government-sponsored health insurance starting from 2018, which would require monthly premiums that may be too much for struggling families like Danhâ€™s. The Health Ministry has said that it is revising regulations to make sure that HIV/AIDS patients in the country are given health insurance cards, and thus be eligible for heavily subsidised medicines. Today, Major Danh TrÆ°á»�ng Danh, deputy head of GÃ nh Dáº§u border post, is clear about on thing, no matter what the situation is with government support. â€œMy wife and I will still carry on, until we are no longer able to do so. â€œI have never thought of what I have been doing as an achievement, although I have been praised a lot by people. I believe that raising orphaned children of comrades is what any solider would do if they were in my shoes.â€� â€” VNS",Society,"['comrades', 'adopted', 'care', 'hivaids', 'kc', 'danhs', 'health', 'adopts', 'khmer', 'danh', 'kid', 'hivinfected', 'treatment', 'children', 'soldier', 'family']","Danh TrÆ°Æ¡Ì€ng Danh, a Khmer solider, is an exception.

VN takes to social media to control HIV/AIDS,"Digital technology and social media are powerful in supporting Viá»‡t Namâ€™s goal to eliminate HIV by 2030, it was announced at a forum yesterday.",[],2018-03-24,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I - Digital technology and social media are powerful in supporting Viá»‡t Namâ€™s goal to eliminate HIV by 2030, it was announced at a forum yesterday. The forum was held in HÃ  Ná»™i to discuss the potential of Viá»‡t Namâ€™s growing social media ecosystem to boost HIV control. The workshop brought the government, the private sector, and communities together to discuss how to further integrate HIV services and support into the digital age. Dr Phan Thá»‹ Thu HÆ°Æ¡ng, vice director of Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said that over 50 per cent of Vietnamese people have access to the internet, and a majority of them use social media. â€œWe need to find creative ways to reach them through new and exciting social media channels,â€� she said. LÃª Minh ThÃ nh, director of social enterprise G-link, said that our online community on social media provides a safe space for people at risk of HIV to learn and talk about safe sex and services such as HIV self-testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). â€œWe can reach more people online and especially those who are afraid to discuss these topics publicly. We can then translate these online conversations into offline action,â€� ThÃ nh said. â€œFor example, we share online booking tools to link people at risk of HIV directly to services, guide them to our e-stores to purchase essentials such as condoms and lubricants, and help them to manage adherence to long-term prevention methods such as PrEP with the iPrEP app on their mobile phones,â€� he added. United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and PATH, an international non-profit health organization, initiated a Healthy Markets project that aims to grow a viable market for HIV-related goods and services capable of meeting the needs of people facing the greatest risks. The project is working with local civil society organizations such as G-link, Lighthouse and Vsmile to test and scale online tools such as the Rainbow Village and Be Me.Be Sexy! Facebook communities and the I Reserve app. I Reserve app, for example, has helped nearly 500 people make appointments for HIV testing and counselling since last year. Among those who use the app, 12.5 per cent were diagnosed with HIVâ€”an HIV-positive rate that is twice as high as that seen through face-to-face referrals. This demonstrates that online tools offer effective ways to engage those most at risk of HIV. Dr John Eyres, USAID Health Office Director, believed that with the introduction of forward-thinking methods such as community-based HIV testing and PrEP, Viá»‡t Nam is known as an early adopter of innovative ways to prevent and manage HIV. Cutting edge online initiatives that are driven by communities, civil society groups, entrepreneurs, and businesses are boosting the uptake of HIV testing, PrEP, and essential products such as condoms, and are playing a critical role in Viá»‡t Namâ€™s efforts to achieve the 90-90-90 goals, he said. â€“ VNS",Society,"['testing', 'social', 'media', 'services', 'viá»‡t', 'vn', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'takes', 'online', 'control', 'risk', 'ways', 'tools']","The forum was held in HÃ  Ná»™i to discuss the potential of Viá»‡t Namâ€™s growing social media ecosystem to boost HIV control.

Co-organised by Vietnam Authority for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), Ministry of Health and the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the events mark an important milestone in securing domestic sustainable financing for the HIV response in Viá»‡t Nam and ensuring that people living with HIV access treatment services. Over 400 representatives from government agencies, international organisations, community-based organisations working with HIV patients, people living with HIV, and media agencies attended the four events. HIV patients need lifelong treatment that can be costly and early and continuous treatment enables them to lead healthy lives and effectively eliminates the risk of sexual transmission to their partners, says a press release issued by the US embassy on Friday. Historically, ARVs were provided free-of-charge in Viá»‡t Nam through international donors. However, over the last five years, the PEPFAR programme, through its activities, has been working with the Government of Viá»‡t Nam to transition the responsibility for financing the countryâ€™s HIV response from donors to SHI. Key in the transition was revising the Social Health Insurance Law and benefit package to include funding for HIV treatment; integrating HIV clinics in the public health system; increasing the number of HIV patients enrolled in SHI from 40 per cent in 2014 to 89 per cent in 2018; procuring ARVs through SHI; and creating procedures for HIV services reimbursement by SHI. Across the world, very few developing countries are applying their SHI programmes to cover HIV treatment services. Among the PEPFAR focused countries, Viá»‡t Nam is the only country mobilising domestic resources through SHI to cover HIV treatment services. This can be attributed to the Government of Viá»‡t Namâ€™s strong commitment to the long-term sustainability of its HIV/AIDS response. Viá»‡t Nam is also a global leader in achieving viral suppression, at 93 per cent. Viral suppression is a measurement of the degree to which the HIV virus is in a personâ€™s bloodstream. When an HIV positive patient achieves viral suppression and has an undetectable viral load, not only do they have a significantly increased likelihood of improved health outcomes, but it also eliminates their likelihood of transmitting HIV. â€” VNS",Society,"['social', 'covered', 'shi', 'suppression', 'patients', 'receiving', 'services', 'viá»‡t', 'events', 'hiv', 'mark', 'nam', 'antiretrovirals', 'viral', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” Simultaneous events were held in HÃ  Ná»™i, Nghá»‡ An, HCM City, and Háº£i PhÃ²ng on Friday to celebrate the first patients receiving antiretroviral (ARV) drugs covered by social health insurance (SHI).

Lack of knowledge results in unfortunate HIV/AIDS cases,A lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest causes of cases in the northern mountainous province of Son La.,[],2015-12-30,vietnamnews.vn,"A mother gets consultation service on HIV/AIDS prevention in the northern mountainous Son La Province. A lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest causes of cases in the province. â€” Photo tiengchuong.vn SON LA (VNS) â€” A lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS is one of the biggest causes of cases in the northern mountainous province of Son La. A 33-year-old local woman, who asked to keep her name anonymous, did not know what HIV/AIDS was and what happened to her husband when he died of the fatal disease eight years ago. She also did not think she needed to have her health checked until she suffered from continuous sickness and blurry vision. Not until she went to a clinic and got advice from doctors did she know about transmission risks and basic knowledge on HIV/AIDS. A situation like this is not uncommon in Son La. Many residents have been ""victims"" of HIV/AIDS in unexpected cases. Tong Van Su, deputy head of Infection Department of General Hospital of Muong La District said that among the ten HIV infected children under treatment at the hospital, there is a child who tested positive for HIV after sucking breast milk of the aunt when the mother was away. Even the childs aunt did not know she was living with HIV. HIV/AIDS now not only focuses in the provinces urban areas but tends to spread to mountainous areas where travelling by vehicles is difficult and the information level remains low. Meanwhile, drug smuggling and abusing were popular, especially in border areas, said Son Las HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Dam Van Huong. About 10,500 HIV/AIDS carriers have been reported in the province so far, according to the provincial HIV/AIDS control and prevention centre. In the first ten months of this year, the province diagnosed 405 HIV infected cases. Up to 525 cases have developed full-blown AIDS and 110 people have died of AIDS. The majority of HIV infected cases belong to patients aged 20 to 39. Cases with women and children are reportedly on the increase. It is estimated that in 2020, the number of females infected will make up 55 per cent of the total while the figure on children is predicted to reach roughly 11 per cent. Huong said that facing these statistics, the province was striving to eradicate the epidemic. However, HIV/AIDS fighting and prevention in the province had faced many difficulties, he said, adding that many infected cases were diagnosed too late, which is one of the reasons for the rapid spread of the disease. A shortage of employees to monitor patients had also limited efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS, he said. Many infected children living in remote mountain areas have faced great difficulties in accessing health care services, which pose challenges to predicting infected cases as well as treatment and caring of anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. The governmental health programme in the province, which encourages the use of methadone therapy to curb drug addicts reliance on certain drugs through 2020 has been slowly implemented and has faced obstacles. About 6,000 drug addicts are expected to be under treatment under this programme, however, until now, only about 10 per cent are under treatment. â€” VNS",Society,"['cases', 'province', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'results', 'unfortunate', 'infected', 'son', 'prevention', 'la', 'treatment', 'children']","A mother gets consultation service on HIV/AIDS prevention in the northern mountainous Son La Province.

Cáº£nh said since the police received the treatment early, the possibility of contracting HIV infection was not high. The treatment will last for 28 days. The police will be tested for HIV after three months. Doctors warned them not to donate blood during the three months of undergoing treatment. T. was reported to have taken ARV since 2010. A virus test in late 2017 indicated a low presence of the HIV virus in his blood. ""Studies show that the possibility of virus transmission to other people remains low if the carrier is treated with ARV and has low level of the HIV virus,"" Cáº£nh said. According to him, anyone who gets exposed to HIV should remain calm, wash the infected spot with clean water, let the blood flow for some time, not squeeze it and then wash the wound again carefully with soap and clean water.

"Stigma hurts HIV diagnosis, treatment","As the HIV response is being integrated into the general healthcare system, improving awareness of healthcare workers is important in addressing discrimination and stigma.",[],2017-12-02,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” As the HIV response is being integrated into the general healthcare system, raising awareness of healthcare workers is important in addressing discrimination and stigma. â€œStigma and discrimination related to HIV remain among the biggest barriers to universal access to HIV health services, and this leads to a high number of AIDS-related deaths,â€� said Marie-Odile Emond, country director of UNAIDS (United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS) Viá»‡t Nam. Despite great efforts from the Government and affected communities over the years, discrimination still exists in schools, workplace, family, community and healthcare facilities, she said at a conference held yesterday in HCM City. This has hindered Viá»‡t Namâ€™s progress towards achieving testing and treatment 90-90-90 targets (90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression) and the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, she said. People living with HIV in fear or denial are less likely to get tested, disclose their HIV status to intimate partners, families and caregivers, and often will seek treatment late and at times even too late. People at higher risks of HIV infection, including users of injected drug, sex workers and men who have sex with men, face even double stigma and discrimination in accessing HIV and other health services. Viá»‡t Nam has a clear supportive legal framework that addresses HIV stigma and discrimination, including the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and many sub-law instruments. â€œThe challenge often lies in inconsistent enforcement of these across all sectors and at all levels, and as the law cannot cover all situations,â€� she added. In 2015, UNAIDS launched a fast-track approach, focusing on innovative interventions to reduce discrimination in healthcare settings in large cities, including HCM City. The pilot project was implemented between September 2016 and December 2017 in three health facilities in HCM City: Pháº¡m Ngá»�c Tháº¡ch Hospital in HCM City, District 6 Hospital, and District 4 Preventive Medical Centre. The project includes two major components: assessment of sigma and discrimination in healthcare settings and interventions to reduce HIV related sigma and discrimination. After more than a year of implementation, the results and useful lessons learned from the project will inform the national policy to reduce discrimination in healthcare settings and expand this effort in other high-burden provinces, with support from development partners. Findings from the project show that it was necessary to measure stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings to develop evidence-based interventions that would improve the quality of health care services. A participatory training approach with healthcare workers to share views and agree on action, as well as dialogue between patients and health care providers to better understand stigma and discrimination issues and health facilitiesâ€™ procedures, are critical factors to reduce HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Discrimination comes from limited awareness and knowledge of HIV, HIV transmission, and lack of universal precautions among healthcare workers, said LÃª Tiáº¿n DÅ©ng, deputy director of Pháº¡m Ngá»�c Tháº¡ch Hospital.

Community-based organisations make significant contributions to HIV/AIDS response,A system of more than 30 local community-based organisations (CBOs) has played an important role in healthcare and HIV prevention for HIV-positive people in Viá»‡t Nam over the past 10 years.,[],2018-09-26,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” A system of more than 30 local community-based organisations (CBOs) has played an important role in healthcare and HIV prevention for HIV-positive people in Viá»‡t Nam over the past 10 years. Last week, CBOS met to discuss the status of healthcare for HIV patients with representatives from the Centre for Promotion of Quality of Life (LIFE) and local businesses, with support from USAID and the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Fund (PEPFAR) in Viá»‡t Nam. The meeting was part of LIFEâ€™s Community HIV Link-Southern project (C-Link) on enhancing capacity for CBOs working on HIV/AIDS. Dr. BÃ¹i Ä�á»©c DÆ°Æ¡ng, deputy head of the Viá»‡t Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), said collaboration between CBOs and the public health system was a key factor to increase the number of key populations using prevention and treatment services. In the last two years, LIFEâ€™s C-Link project helped 32,000 HIV-positive people enroll in care and treatment programmes. This year, the project was able to detect more than 2,380 new HIV cases, or one-third of the number of HIV-positive patients in HCM City. CBOs offer HIV tests and treatment referral for MSMs (men who have sex with men) and transgender people. Their core outreach teams include university students and other youths who work to reach their young peers. Cao Táº¥n ThÃ nh, a member of VÆ°á»£t SÃ³ng (Overcome Waves), said he formerly used injected drugs and had received LIFE training since 2011. He actively supports his peers to connect to methadone and HIV services. Huá»³nh Tiáº¿n Ä�áº¡t, head of CBO Sáº¯c MÃ u Cuá»™c Sá»‘ng (Colours of Life), said: â€œWhile conducting lay tests, I always listen and show empathy to my clients, and am ready to support them with care and good services.â€� CBOsâ€™ members are professionals who collect and use data for service improvement. Driven by increased high-tech demand, the group invented the â€œTHEBOY Appâ€�, according to LÃª Thanh PhÆ°Æ¡ng, head of The Boy CBO. The app features online scheduling with SMS notifications, one-on-one chat functions, and updated HIV information. Meanwhile, AloBoy CBO provides services for MSMs and male sex workers, using project monitoring and evaluation indicators to better understand clientsâ€™ needs and appraise team performance. The Ná»¥ SÆ°á»�i (Smile) CBO, which targets persons who use injected drugs (PWID), female sex workers, has established a strong linkage with health centres for treatment referral methadone programmes. It is known for high success in finding drop-outs from the programme and client follow-ups. Self-funding Dr TiÃªu Thá»‹ Thu VÃ¢n, head of the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre, said there was a lack of proper attention from government agencies toward funding. All CBOs will have to mobilise domestic resources when international funding falls, as is expected. The aim is to diversify services to secure financial resources and capacity for sustainability through many approaches. Pháº¡m Há»“ng SÆ¡n, head of G3VN organisation, said: â€œWe seek the private sectorâ€™s support such as calling for donations and subsidised condoms at wholesale rates.â€� The group also creates online marketing, and door-to-door goods delivery to generate more jobs and incomes for members. Meanwhile, the head of the Glink community-based organisation, said that Glink had opened three juice and coffee shops, and a menâ€™s health clinic with a pharmacy. LIFE is a non-profit Vietnamese social organisation established in 2007 under the Viá»‡t Nam Union of Science and Technology Association. Nguyá»…n NguyÃªn NhÆ° Trang, director of LIFE, said that LIFE training helps CBOs to become more innovative and builds staff capacity.

Total market strategy could fill gaps in int'l HIV/AIDS funding,A conference held in Hai Phong City last week discussed the promise of a total market approach to Viet Nam's HIV prevention efforts now that foreign HIV-aid to the country will cease in 2017.,[],2015-09-07,vietnamnews.vn,"Viet Nam hopes to reduce the number of people with HIV to 0.3 per cent by 2020. â€” File Photo HAI PHONG (VNS) â€” A conference held in Hai Phong City last week discussed the promise of a total market approach to Viet Nams HIV prevention efforts now that foreign HIV-aid to the country will cease in 2017. The cut in international funds comes now that Viet Nam has middle-income country status. A â€˜total market approach means the Government would mobilise public and private stakeholders to enhance sustainable access to health products and services for all people, especially, people with HIV. The approach enables government and private donors to prioritise finite resources for populations that need free or subsidised commodities and services, and allows the commercial market to provide options for those that are able and prefer to pay. The approach is seen as key to Viet Nams adaptation to rapidly changing HIV prevention and treatment structures, said Ngo Minh Trang from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Christopher Brady, a market dynamics specialist from PATH â€“ an international non-profit organisation, said that the approach is especially important when government resources are limited and foreign aid declines. He suggested that the Government assess the perspectives of different stakeholders to better attract interest. Secondly, it should evaluate the business environment and market segmentation. Thirdly, establish a technical support group under the Ministry of Health. According to Ministry of Health statistics, over 227,000 people live with HIV in Viet Nam. According to Trang from USAID, nearly 80 per cent of current funding for HIV prevention efforts in the country comes from international donors. These donors have provided free anti-retroviral (ARV) treatments and free condoms to female sex-workers, but that funding would be dropped at the same time the foreign aid is cut. ""It is a challenge but also a chance for the private domestic sector to produce cheap condoms to meet the market demand,"" Trang said. Engaging the private sector would have to play a big role to ensure the sustainability of HIV prevention efforts in Viet Nam, she said. At the conference, a survey conducted across six provinces by Taylor Nelson Sofres Viet Nam â€“ a market research provider - was released which shifted discussion to the topic of condoms, an important preventative measure. The report estimated that a female sex-worker would be willing to pay VND2,000-4,000 (9 -18 US cents) to buy a condom and someone of the MSM group (men who have sex with men) could afford VND3,500-8,000 (15-35 US cents). A person who injects drugs would be willing to pay VND2,000-4,500 per condom. Pham Duc Manh, deputy director of the Ministry of Healths Administration of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said that the conference allowed international and domestic experts, policy-makers and private sector representatives to discuss how to effectively apply the total market approach. Combating stigma More than 18,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV in Ha Noi, and 5,000 people have died from AIDS, making it one of the highest HIV/AIDS localities in the country. The information update came at another conference on combating stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV, co-organised by the Ministry of Health, the Ha Noi Health Department and USAID, last Thursday. The city reported 434 new HIV cases and 75 AIDS-related deaths in the first half of the year. Most of the HIV-infected people are between the ages of 20 to 39 and HIV transmission through heterosexual sex is increasing. The rate of HIV transmission through homosexual sex has also begun to rise in the last one to two years. Stigma and discrimination against those suffering from HIV/AIDS hampers the progress of activities to tackle the disease. The Viet Nam National Network of People Living with HIV in 2014 conducted a study of 1,600 respondents to assess stigma and discrimination faced by HIV-infected people. The results revealed unacceptably high rates of many forms of stigma and discrimination. Gossip remained the most commonly reported form of stigma and discrimination, experienced by nearly one-quarter of respondents. Insults and social exclusion were experienced by 5.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively. A total of 6.7 per cent of respondents were refused employment, and 4.2 per cent of them lost their job or source of income. HIV-infected woman were the most likely to report physical assault with the figure hovering at 2.8 per cent. Female sex workers, HIV-infected women and people who inject drugs are the groups whose rights are most often violated. ""HIV-related stigma and discrimination are synonymous with â€˜death,"" said Country Director of UNAIDS - Viet Nam, Kristan Schoultz. Schoultz added that stigma and discrimination not only affected individuals with HIV but also increases HIV transmission in the community as fear keeps people from getting tested, treated or use preventative measures. ""We must act now, without delay to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030,"" said deputy head of the Ministry of Healths Administration of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, Hoang Dinh Canh. â€” VNS",Society,"['total', 'ministry', 'nam', 'hiv', 'intl', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'gaps', 'discrimination', 'private', 'prevention', 'cent', 'strategy', 'stigma', 'funding', 'market']","Viet Nam hopes to reduce the number of people with HIV to 0.3 per cent by 2020.

Life still difficult for HIV/AIDS affected kids,"More than 14,700 children affected by HIV/AIDS have received full healthcare, education and nutritional assistance after a national action plan began implementation three years ago.",[],2016-11-23,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” Children affected by HIV/AIDS continue to face discrimination and other challenges despite significant gains made in efforts to help them, officials said at a meeting yesterday. More than 14,700 children affected by HIV/AIDS have received full healthcare, education and nutritional assistance after a national action plan began implementation three years ago. The 2014-2020 National Action Plan for Children Affected by HIV/AIDS has thus far covered 70 per cent of the targeted children. The plan defines children affected by HIV/AIDS disease as those who have contracted HIV, those whose parents have died of HIV/AIDS, those living with HIV/AIDS parents, and those with high risk of HIV/AIDS because their parents were drug-users or commercial sex workers. The figures were revealed at the meeting organised in Ha Noi by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) to summarise initial results of the action plan. MoLISA Deputy Minister Ä�Ã o Há»“ng Lan said 248 of 345 centres across the country have been equipped with essential skills to take care for children affected by HIV/AIDS. At present, 84 per cent of schools in the country were admitting children affected by HIV/AIDS, Lan said. Viá»‡t Nam now has about 21,000 children affected by HIV/AIDS, including 6,800 living with HIV/AIDS. Among the goals set in the action plan are to provide healthcare, education and nutritional assistance to 90 per cent of affected children by 2020; to equip 90 per cent of centres with skills needed to care for children affected by HIV/AIDS; and to have 100 per cent of schools in the country admit children affected by HIV/AIDS. Challenges remain Despite the progress made, challenges remained in assisting children affected by HIV/AIDS, Lan said. Public awareness of taking care of and protecting children affected by HIV/AIDS had not improved as expected, she said, adding that children affected by the virus and disease still faced discrimination. HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh, deputy head of the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said lack of knowledgeable staff at HIV/AIDS child care centres was one of the challenges. The meeting heard that 27 provinces and cities had failed to spend enough money on caring for children affected by HIV/AIDS. Task force Lan said her ministry would work with the Health Ministry and the Ministry of Education and Training to meet the national action planâ€™s targets. A task force with officials and experts from the three ministries would work to outline the most effective model for supporting children affected by HIV/AIDS in the remaining four years (2017-20), she said. â€œ:There would be more frequent dissemination of information to raise public awareness and reduce discrimination in our society,â€� she said. 8,000 new HIV patients Meanwhile, the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control has announced that about 8,000 people have contracted HIV in the first ten months of this year. The number marked a slight decline compared to the same period last year, Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, head of the administration that functions under the Health Ministry, told online newspaper Vietnam Plus on Monday. The administration estimates the number of people living with AIDS at 6,500 and HIV-related deaths to reach 2,000 by the end of this year. The death toll was the same as previous years and is set to rise in certain areas in the coming years, he said. Long said sexual intercourse had been identified as the most common cause for HIV/AIDS transmission in Viá»‡t Nam now. Earlier, the sharing of syringes by drug abusers had been identified as the main cause of transmission. The most vulnerable groups were wives and partners of HIV/AIDS patients, he said. â€œThis means that although we had curbed the HIV/AIDS diseaseâ€™s spread over the past 30 years, the potential for recurrence of an outbreak still exists if we fail to take stricter measures,â€� he added. Therefore, Viá»‡t Nam would continue giving top priority to achieving the 90-90-90 targets by 2020 (with vision towards 2030), Long said. The targets are to ensure at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV know their status; 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy diagnosed with viral suppression. According to the Health Ministry, there are over 215,600 people living with HIV in the country, and 88,868 people living with AIDS. The total number of people whoâ€™ve died after contracting HIV is 89,412.

Govt to bring all HIV patients into insurance net,"As HIV funding dries up, Govt wants to bring all patients into insurance net",[],2017-07-05,vietnamnews.vn,"San HÃ  HCM CITY â€” N.C.T, a 32-year-old man, and his partner, a 38-year-old man, are waiting at the District 11 Preventive Medicine Centre to receive free antiretroviral drugs. With international support, ARV treatment has been made available free of charge in Viá»‡t Nam. But from next year the two men will no longer enjoy free medicines and treatment, and health insurance cards will be the lifebuoy for HIV patients like them. They live together in a rented house in BÃ¬nh TÃ¢n District, but have been coming to the centre for HIV treatment for the past three years for fear of being seen in their neighbourhood waiting in a queue to pick up medication for HIV. But since social stigma and discrimination remain widespread in the country, most insured people living with HIV are unwilling to use their health insurance cards for fear of revealing their infection status. â€œMy company buys a health insurance card for me,â€� N.C.T said. â€œThe company might discover my HIV infection if I register for treatment using the health insurance card.â€� According to BÃ¹i Thá»‹ TÃº Anh, deputy head of the centreâ€™s public health consulting and support department, the concern about disclosure of their HIV infection status is very common among patients. Around 2,000 people are being treated at the department, with 74 per cent having insurance. â€œMany patients are teachers, students, State officials, managers and senior workers in large companies, and all of them have health insurance. But they refuse to use the insurance for HIV treatment due to the fear of leaking their infection status.â€� Many patients want to buy additional health insurance to exclusively use for their HIV treatment, but one person is allowed to get only one health insurance card. As international donors are phasing out assistance for HIV/AIDS control in Viá»‡t Nam, patients have to pay for health checks, regular tests and ARV treatment next year if they do not have national health insurance. 100 per cent insurance coverage With donors phasing out assistance, social health insurance for people living with HIV will become vital to sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services. Between 2008 and 2013 the city received international support for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment from long-term sponsors such as the U.S. Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and the Clinton Foundation. PEPFARâ€™s aid accounted for 80-85 per cent of the cityâ€™s financial resources to combat HIV/AIDS, TiÃªu Thá»‹ Thu VÃ¢n, director of the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, said. ""International financial support has been decreasing since 2011 and is expected to dry up in the next two years,"" she said. Funding from the central budget falls short of the need, plunging from nearly VNÄ�7.9 billion (US$349,550) in 2012 to just VNÄ�1.7 billion (US$75,220) in 2014. In 2016-20 there is not a single national programme for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. HIV/AIDS work in the city is estimated to require more than VNÄ�2.8 trillion (US$123.89 million)in 2014-20. But only VNÄ�2.22 trillion (US$98.23 million) is likely to be mobilised, resulting in a shortage of nearly VNÄ�579 billion, according to VÃ¢n. HCM City has nearly 30,000 people living with HIV, of whom 70 per cent of them were covered by health insurance, according to statistics from the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. ""The city government targets bringing everyone living with HIV into the health insurance net next year,"" DÆ°Æ¡ng Minh Háº£i, head of the centreâ€™s care and treatment department, said. To achieve the target, the Peopleâ€™s Committee has approved use of the surplus in the health insurance fund last year to buy health insurance cards for disadvantaged HIV patients who cannot afford to pay for them. However, there are nearly 1,000 HIV patients without identity documents such as identity cards, household registration books and residence cards or in jail. â€œInsured HIV patients without identity documents are ineligible for health insurance as patients are required to furnish identity documents,â€� Háº£i said â€œThis is the greatest challenge yet to be addressed.â€� Kim Chi Na, head of the District 11 Preventive Medicine Centreâ€™s public health consulting and support department, said for people living with HIV, ARV had been a life-saver. Those who do not stick to the ARV regimen prescribed by their doctors might become resistant to the drugs. Resistance increases the risk that the virus will mutate and produce drug-resistant HIV. Patients without identity documents would not be able to adhere to their treatment regime due to a lack of financial support, increasing risk of HIV drug resistance, she said. To address this problem, the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre plans to work with the city Public Security Agency to set up a team dedicated to study specific cases and help such patients get identity documents. Outpatient clinics Since November 2015 the Ministry of Health has ordered local health departments to make payments for the treatment of insured HIV patients as well as expand insurance coverage for people living with HIV. The city has 46 outpatient clinics that provide ARV treatment, according to the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. Outpatient clinics at the HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Pháº¡m Ngá»�c Tháº¡ch Hospital, and Paediatrics Hospital No.1 and No.2 have provided health checks and treatment for HIV patients with insurance. BÃ¹i Ä�á»©c DÆ°Æ¡ng, deputy director of the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said with the current limited resources it was essential for everyone with HIV to sign up for the health insurance scheme. The administration would mobilise all resources and create favorable conditions for people with HIV to be covered by health insurance and help them comply with the ARV regime at any cost, he said. The Vietnamese Government targets bringing 100 per cent of people with HIV into the health insurance net by 2020. It targets the 90-90-90 goal by 2020, which refers to 90 per cent of all people living with HIV knowing their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people diagnosed with HIV getting sustained antiretroviral therapy, and 90 per cent of all people receiving the therapy having viral suppression. As of the end of last January, the country had 116,000 people with HIV getting ARV treatment. â€”VNS",Society,"['bring', 'arv', 'patients', 'city', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'net', 'cent', 'govt', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","But they refuse to use the insurance for HIV treatment due to the fear of leaking their infection status.â€�Many patients want to buy additional health insurance to exclusively use for their HIV treatment, but one person is allowed to get only one health insurance card. 100 per cent insurance coverageWith donors phasing out assistance, social health insurance for people living with HIV will become vital to sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services.

Enlisting the community in fight with HIV,His plan to study abroad collapsed just a few hours before an interview at the US embassy in Ha Noi after his father caught him using drugs in a hotel restroom.,[],2015-12-01,vietnamnews.vn,"by Luu Van Dat HCM CITY (VNS) â€” His plan to study abroad collapsed just a few hours before an interview at the US embassy in Ha Noi after his father caught him using drugs in a hotel restroom. Nguyen Thanh Hoa, 36, a former drug user who has HIV and hepatitis B and C, recently recalled the incident from 19 years ago with pain palpable in his eyes. Hoa â€“ he asked not to be identified by his real name since the stigma against HIV/AIDS remains in Viet Nam â€” saw his life change totally, and he became a peer educator rather than a doctor with a US degree. ""My father was not at all angry when he found me using drugs that day; he was upset. He asked me to suspend the plan to go abroad and go instead to a rehabilitation centre."" At that time his father had hopes that some day his only son would kick his drug addiction and resume his education. But Hoa destroyed all those hopes: he had to be admitted to public and private rehabilitation centres at least 30 times and was later found infected with HIV. Hoa cannot forget how he got caught up in the world of drugs. In 1993, when he was a 14 year-old schoolboy and meritorious student for several consecutive years, he met some strangers from Hai Phong in his neighbourhood. They offered him and some others in the area some free heroin to smoke with cigarettes saying it would make him energetic and smarter. ""At that time I had no idea about the danger of heroin. I thought it was the same as cigarettes. After that time they gave me heroin a couple of times more."" Once his mother found some heroin in a pocket while washing his clothes, and he lied to her that it was a medicine belonging to his friend. Having no idea about drugs, she believed him. From using heroin, he turned to injecting drugs, sharing needles with friends. Little did he or they worry about the risk of contracting HIV this way. But when some of them tested positive for HIV, Hoa began to worry. One day he decided to get himself tested at the Pasteur Institute. His father said he would come along. ""I prepared myself mentally for the worst."" They went to get the test results. He had HIV. ""I felt sad after getting the result, but did not cry at the Pasteur Institute."" But that night he cried alone sitting in his balcony. Worse was to come. He did not stop using drugs or sharing needles. The only concession he made was to shoot himself last, thinking that way he was protecting his friends from his HIV. He ended up contracting both hepatitis B and C. Life with HIV A friend and reformed drug user came to meet Hoa a few months later and suggested he should play online games instead of using drugs, hoping he would become addicted to something less dangerous. He tried but failed to get hooked on games. His life changed when he once went to the District 4 Preventive Health Centres HIV/AIDS Counselling and Community Support. There he got methadone and ARV treatment and met and received support from other former drug users. Gradually he gave up drugs, though there is the occasional recidivism, according to his doctor. Realising that the lack of knowledge about drugs and HIV/AIDS had destroyed his life, Hoa wanted to become a peer educator to provide information to and help other people in a similar situation. He often visits places where people buy drugs and coffee shops to befriend other drug users and warn them about drugs and HIV. ""Most people think I am a policeman. Some run away on seeing me."" But with his looks and needle scars on both arms, Hoa convinces most people enough for them to speak with him. He then meets them several times first before starting to educate them. He works for community-based organisation Cuoc song moi (New life), which helps 200 to 300 drug users. Explaining the motivation for becoming a peer educator, he said: ""Being a drug addict, I brought my parents much misery. I want everyone to avoid the mistakes I made with the help of information. Thanks to the communitys support, I have a wife and a son who do not have HIV."" Hoa is very happy with what he is doing. Gay community Ben Tre native Huynh Tien Dat, 26, a gay man who moved to HCM City in 2007, has helped several HIV-infected people through his community organisation Sac mau cuoc song (Colours of life) , which he founded with a friend. It works with the gay community and focuses on HIV. Dat said: ""I feel very happy when I can introduce one HIV patient to the [District 4] centre for free medicines. I remember my first client. I met him in an online chat forum. After getting the result, he wanted to kill himself. I counselled him."" This inspired the man to help more and more members of the MSM community though he earns little money from his work. This year his organisations 10 peer educators took 560 gay people to the centre for tests and it turned out that 25 had HIV. Dat personally counsels 100 people a year. Dr Le Thu Thuy of the centres HIV/AIDS Counselling and Community Support, said Hoa does well in his job of a peer educator. In recent years peer educators have helped the centre prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, introducing most of the 1,300 patients currently receiving ARV treatment, she said. ""Every month one peer educator is asked to bring eight clients."" During a visit to the centre in October, US ambassador Ted Osius praised the role and contributions of community-based organisations in preventing HIV/AIDS, hailing the ""tremendous progress"" made by Viet Nam in recent years. ""It is very important to involve civil society in the efforts,"" he said. â€” VNS",Society,"['peer', 'community', 'fight', 'hiv', 'drug', 'hivaids', 'heroin', 'using', 'hoa', 'life', 'drugs', 'enlisting']","""My father was not at all angry when he found me using drugs that day; he was upset.

Funding shortage hinders Viet Nam HIV/AIDS fight,Medical experts are concerned that an outbreak of the HIV virus is likely to return to Vietnam any time due to a lack of funds.,[],2015-09-30,vietnamnews.vn,"Addicted people is treated by methadone in southern Ba Ria Vung Tau Province. Medical experts are concerned that an outbreak of the HIV virus is likely to return to Vietnam any time due to a lack of funds. â€” Photo baobariavungtau.com.vn HA NOI (VNS) â€” Medical experts are concerned that an outbreak of the HIV virus is likely to return to Vietnam any time due to a lack of funds. A funding shortage could open the way to a potential health catastrophe, said Nguyen Hoang Long, director of Ministry of Healths Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, at a workshop held in Ha Noi last week to design an HIV/AIDS Prevention for the 2016-2020 period. It is estimated that Viet Nam will need at least VND7.4 trillion (US$329 million) for the programme for 2016-20 period but it will lack about 11 per cent of the capital. Because the HIV prevention programme will not be a national target programme, it will suffer a big reduction in budget allocation. About 80 per cent of funding for HIV response in Viet Nam comes from external donors but the funding will be gradually lowered because Viet Nam has now been classed as a middle-income country. For example, Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS will cease funding by 2015, the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) by 2018. Statistics from the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control showed that as of June, there were 227,114 people living with HIV in Viet Nam. Of these, 71,115 HIV carriers had progressed to AIDS and 76,588 people had died. The HIV epidemic had spread to 99.8 per cent of districts and over 80.3 per cent of wards and communes across the country. Long said ARV drugs could suppress the HIV virus, stop the progression of HIV and reduce HIV infections in the community. During the 2011 to 15 period, the country saved 150,000 people living with HIV from fatalities and helped 400,000 people avoid HIV infection. Long said about 98,000 people with HIV had received free ARV treatment in the country to date. He said it cost about VND420 billion (US$19 million) a year to treat 98,000 people with HIV. Thus, the cost for medical treatment for one person treated with ARV was about VND4 million (US$181) a year. ""As funds dry up, many HIV carriers may abandon treatment because they cannot afford it, raising the risk of those with HIV progressing to AIDS. ""Finding alternative sources to maintain the provision of HIV related goods and services is crucial,"" he said. Long stressed the need for increased budget allocation for HIV/AIDS prevention in the coming years. According to the HIV/AIDs prevention plan for 2016 to 2020, Viet Nam will focus on keeping the rate of new HIV cases below 0.3 per cent by 2020, while reducing the impact of HIV/AID on socio-economic development. The plan includes national targets of 80 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 49 having adequate knowledge of HIV, 80 per cent of the population not discriminating against people living with HIV, and 90 per cent of people living with HIV understanding their condition and receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. HIV/AIDS prevention in the future will focus on providing sterile syringes for drug users, especially those in mountainous and far-flung areas, expanding the use of new and traditional medicine in detoxification. It also concentrates on studying and applying preventive measures against HIV and expanding the number of HIV testing clinics nationwide. â€” VNS",Society,"['funding', 'arv', 'fight', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'cent', 'prevention', 'virus', 'hinders', 'shortage']","A funding shortage could open the way to a potential health catastrophe, said Nguyen Hoang Long, director of Ministry of Health's Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, at a workshop held in Ha Noi last week to design an HIV/AIDS Prevention for the 2016-2020 period.

Social worker helps fellow gay men recover from HIV,Anh Quá»‘c Kiá»‡t has dedicated his life to helping fellow gay men seek treatment for HIV/AIDSâ€”and overcome discrimination to gain confidence in their lives after what many still see as a shameful diagnosis.,[],2017-11-01,vietnamnews.vn,"KHÃ�NH HÃ’A â€“ Anh Quá»‘c Kiá»‡t has dedicated his life to helping fellow gay men seek treatment for HIV/AIDS and overcome discrimination to gain confidence in their lives after what many still see as a shameful diagnosis. Kiá»‡t lives in Ninh HÃ²a Township in the southern central province of KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a. He is a member of SÃ³ng Biá»ƒn (Sea Waves) group â€“ a community organisation that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention among prostitutes, drug-addicts, and gay men. Over the last three years, Kiá»‡t has built relationships with 180 gay men in the community, 12 of whom are HIV-positive. He encourages them to practice safe sex, provides information about STDs and encourages them to seek testing, and helps them pursue lives of meaning after a diagnosis, online newspaper Vietnamplus reported in a recent story. His work is increasingly important: According to latest figures released by the Health Ministry this year, the proportion of HIV-positive gay men has increased, while the number of HIV-positive prostitutes and drug addicts has declined in recent years. As of May this year, there were 209,754 HIV-positive people and 90,882 died of AIDS since the disease was first diagnosed in the country. In KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a Province, gay people accounted for 18.8 per cent out of a total of 101 HIV-positive individuals, increasing 11.3 per cent against 2015, said Dr. Tráº§n VÄƒn Tin, director of the provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre. In response, public health officials have dedicated more resources to the high-risk group of gay men. SÃ³ng Biá»ƒn is one of three such groups in KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a Province. The 18-member organisation was established in 2015 with funds from the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. Kiá»‡t and his colleagues work at the grass-roots level. They are in constant contact with individuals at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. They daily lives are occupied with the struggles and fears of others. â€œPersuading a person who I did not know before to take an HIV test has been a really hard journeyâ€�, Kiá»‡t said. â€œTo go from strangers to friends, sometimes becoming even closer than family because I know their secrets, I had to create absolute trust.â€� Serving his community He feels he is more effective in his work because he understands the continuing difficulty of being gay in a conservative country. â€œHomosexual men always feel an inferiority complexâ€�, Kiá»‡t said. â€œThey are hardly able to express their real sexuality, even to family members. So many people have been angry and resentful for a long time, and they respond with a promiscuous sexual lifeâ€�, he said. This makes them more susceptible to HIV/AIDS. â€œBecause I am a homosexual man too, I feel and sympathise with their pains,â€� Kiá»‡t said. â€œSo I talk with them easily.â€� Kiá»‡t said many HIV-positive men told him that they felt despair. Sometimes they contemplated taking revenge on life by deliberately infecting their partners with HIV. â€œI saw many people wanted to kill themselves when they tested positive for HIV,â€� Kiá»‡t said. â€œI had to find any way to relieve their fear and bring them back to life.â€� For the last three years, Kiá»‡tâ€™s life has been full of journeys which he organised for HIV/AIDS-positive men to find encouragement and consolation. The groups take trips to mountains, beaches and islands to help them release their dispiritedness and desperation. He has successfully persuaded hundreds of gay men to complete HIV tests and seek treatment. To do his job effectively, he must reach out to strangers and become a trusted friend. He makes face-to-face contacts at events and introduces himself on Facebook, the messaging app Zalo, and online forums of the gay community. Kiá»‡t recalled one case in which it took a great deal of time to persuade a young man to take an HIV test and seek treatment. â€œHe was a 21-year-old young man. He was a callboyâ€�, Kiá»‡t recalled. â€œThe boy had not used condoms, so he lived under a cloud of fear that he might be infected with HIV, but was not brave enough to do a test. He always wanted to end his life by jumping down from a high mountainâ€�, he said. The boy lived 28km from Kiá»‡tâ€™s house. For a month, Kiá»‡t visited the boy everyday to persuade him to do a test. His efforts were not in vain. After six monthâ€™s of treatment, the boyâ€™s health had improved and he had renewed optimism about life. He is now working in a local restaurant. Everyday, Kiá»‡t makes phone calls or attends coffee dates to comfort and advise men living with HIV. Over last three years, Kiá»‡t has successfully convinced seven HIV-positive gay men to obtain treatment. â€œI just want to tell gay men, â€˜You should do everything you like but you should be healthyâ€™â€�, Kiá»‡t said. â€“ VNS",Society,"['social', 'men', 'kiá»‡t', 'seek', 'lives', 'hÃ²a', 'hiv', 'helps', 'recover', 'hivpositive', 'gay', 'life', 'khÃ¡nh', 'fellow', 'worker']","He is a member of SÃ³ng Biá»ƒn (Sea Waves) group â€“ a community organisation that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention among prostitutes, drug-addicts, and gay men.

Anh said the State budget could only reserve VNÄ�100 billion (US$4.4 million) for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in 2016-20, but the demand is for about VNÄ�600 billion ($27 million). She said most people with HIV/AIDS cannot afford prolonged use of ARV and other drugs for opportunistic infections. Anh said that was why Government and various agencies have been conducting discussions on implementation of the Prime Ministerâ€™s decision on payment for ARV and support for ARV users through health insurance. â€œOnly 40 per cent of people with HIV/AIDS have enrolled in social health insurance, while 72 out of 385 (18.7 per cent) of health service centres provided payment for HIV/AIDS patients through insurance,â€� Anh said. â€œThe decision will help people with HIV access health service and treatment, through different sources, including a fund for the poor,â€� she said. In some places, AIDS patients had received support through flexible policies of the local administration. Tráº§n TrÆ°á»�ng Minh, from VÄ©nh PhÃºc Provinceâ€™s insurance, said the northern province had allocated funds from donations and other sources to enable HIV/AIDS patients to get treatment free of charge. He said people with HIV/AIDS still hesitate to get treatment at health centres due to fear of discrimination. LÃª Thá»‹ L. (assumed name), a Ä�Ã  Náºµng resident with HIV/AIDS, said she has been getting full treatment and ARV at a local health centre for years. â€œI and other people with HIV/AIDS cannot pay for health services if we do not have insurance. The city also raises different funds to provide a zero fee for us,â€� she said. â€œActually, earning a living is still hard for us, so a helpful hand from the city eases our daily burden,â€� she said. Deputy Minister of Heath, Nguyá»…n Thanh Long, said the Prime Ministerâ€™s decision will make a big change for people with HIV/AIDS. â€œViá»‡t Nam has followed the target over past nine years, and committed to complete the â€™Zero to HIV/AIDSâ€™ campaign by 2030,â€� Long said. â€œThe country has been seeking a flexible paying mechanism to ensure that 80 per cent of HIV/AIDS patients enroll in health insurance by the end of 2017 and 100 per cent in 2018,â€� Long said. He said the Health Insurance Fund will cover full payment of health services and ARV for 90 per cent of people with HIV/AIDS in 2018. He said 90,000 have died and 230,000 live with the disease. Meanwhile, about 10,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS are diagnosed each year. Long also asked provincial health centres to provide drugs for HIV/AIDS patients from the Insurance Fund starting next July. The deputy minister also said the ministry plans to provide health insurance for prisoners with HIV/AIDS and offenders at rehabilitation centres. Last month, the city and the Viá»‡t Nam Health Improvement Project (VNHIP) inked a new agreement on health care for kids with HIV/AIDS in the city in 2017-21, with total funding of US$150,000.

A conference held yesterday in HÃ  Ná»™i to wrap up a national project on sustainable management of HIV/AIDS response also heard that nearly 19,000 people injecting drugs have been given methadone treatment this year. This accounted for 20 per cent of total methadone treatment patients in the country. The US$45 million, five-year (2011-2016) project on Sustainable Management of HIV/AIDS response and Transition to Technical Assistance (SMART TA) was funded by the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief. In its final year alone, the project provided treatment to more than 23,000 people living with HIV, the conference heard. The project was implemented by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 11 provinces. USAID Vietnam Mission Director Michael Greene said that Viá»‡t Nam has achieved great results in HIV response in recent years. The response increasingly relies on local resources such as health insurance; and national and provincial funding have become key support sources, he noted. The project has also helped integrate HIV services into the curative health system where facilities can be reimbursed through social health insurance, he said. HIV patients in northern Ä�iá»‡n BiÃªn and central Nghá»‡ An provinces were the first to receive social health insurance reimbursement for HIV services. Nguyá»…n Tá»‘ NhÆ°, deputy chief of the project, said that one of the achievements of the project was its work in mountainous areas, where many people cannot access health services because of the long distance between their houses and local health clinics. The project provided mobile laboratories to provide HIV tests for people in mountainous areas, and results were provided in 24 hours instead of the usual week. She cited Quáº¿ Phong and Quá»³ ChÃ¢u districts in central Nghá»‡ An Province as examples. After establishing mobile and satellite laboratories in these localities, as many as 500 at-risk people in Quáº¿ Phong District and more 300 in Quá»³ ChÃ¢u District have been tested. No reduction Phan Thá»‹ Thu HÆ°Æ¡ng, deputy director of Vietnam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control, said that after five years of implementing the project, the number of newly-infected people in HCM City has reportedly not reduced. In the 2011-2015 period, HIV infections through sexual transmission accounted for 57.5 per cent and blood transmission was 41.3 per cent. She said it was necessary to strengthen preventive work, and ensure that at least 90 per cent of patients knew their status, 90 per cent of those who knew their status were on treatment and 90 per cent of those on treatment were virally suppressed. These targets would help country could stamp out the HIV epidemic by 2030, she said. AIDS insurance As international donors have begun phasing out assistance, health insurance for people living with HIV/AIDS has become crucial for prevention, testing and providing anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment, health officials say. The AIDS response overall is funded mainly by international donors who provide 70 to 80 per cent of all funds. Some aspects of the response, particularly ARV treatment, are fully funded by donors. Coverage of HIV treatment by the national health insurance scheme is crucial to increasing domestic funding of the AIDS response, as external funding will come to an end next year, they add. Only 40 per cent of people living with HIV have health insurance, according to a report released by the Ministry of Health. Most people living with HIV are poor, many of whom are without a permanent residence or a stable job with health insurance, said Nguyá»…n Há»¯u HÆ°ng, deputy director of the HCM Cityâ€™s Department of Health. As ARV treatment has been made available free of charge due to international donor support, people living with HIV have found it unnecessary to purchase health insurance. HIV-related stigma and discrimination remain significant barriers to providing health insurance coverage to infected people. Many people living with HIV are afraid of their condition being made known to the public and refuse to join a health insurance scheme, HÆ°ng said. Nearly 50 per cent of people living with HIV in HCM City are covered by health insurance, but very few use the insurance cards for health exams because of anxiety about discrimination. The number of people living with HIV in the city is estimated at 41,000, with nearly 28,000 people under ARV treatment, he said. It is estimated that ARV treatment costs VNÄ�12,000-24,000 for ARV treatment per person per day. The financial burden of treatment costs could hinder access to ARV treatment for poor, uninsured people living with HIV, he added. According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Department, ARV treatment costs around VNÄ�420 billion ($18.58 million) per year. The Prime Minister has ordered local authorities to create the most favourable conditions for all people with HIV/AIDS to join the national health insurance scheme. Local health sectors have been asked to sign contracts with health insurance agencies to ensure benefits for insured people with HIV/AIDS. Insured people living with HIV/AIDS will enjoy full payment for ARV treatment from health insurance agencies and the local State budget. The number of people living with HIV is estimated at 230,000 in Viá»‡t Nam.

The provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre also helped the commune give normal lives to HIV sufferers. â€” Photo coutesy of Thua Thien Hue HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre by Phuoc Buu THUA THIEN HUE (VNS)â€” When men began dying of AIDS in 2004 in central Thua Thien Hue Provinces Loc Bon Commune, it struck terror in the hearts of locals because there were no drugs and few prostitutes in the area. Since then the commune has been called the ""HIV commune"" by some local newspapers. A total of 25 people have been found to be infected with HIV. Eleven of them died. ""The situation was really bad in 2004, because in other communes only two or three HIV-infected cases were reported,"" said Doctor Vo Dai Thuan, head of the communes healthcare service. All of the 11 people who died of AIDS were guest workers who had laboured in neighbouring Laos. Le Van Khuong, deputy chairman of the commune peoples committee, said: ""In 1990s, many locals went to Laos for jobs, including construction workers, carpenters, tailors and babysitters. We supported them in passport procedures but we didnt manage them under any guest worker contracts."" Khuong said from 1997 to 2004, more and more workers went to Laos for jobs because of the higher income they could earn there. Almost all of them spent a whole year in Laos and returned to their home village only for Tet. They had sex with prostitutes in Laos and were not aware of their HIV infection, which they transferred to their wives. This made the commune a key locality in the national list of communes with HIV that needed close control. With a total of 23 HIV and AIDS cases, the commune was at top of the list of HIV and AIDS carriers. Nowadays, local health staff have slowed the increase of HIV cases in the commune. The situation has been under control since 2008. ""There were no newly infected cases in 2009 and 2010,"" Thuan said. ""Two new cases were recorded in the last two years. Both were guest workers in Laos."" Thuan said the education programme had raised awareness of locals. ""Preventive education among vulnerable groups has prevented the spread of HIV."" Thuan emphasised that close monitoring by the Thua Thien Hue HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre had helped HIV mothers give birth to children which tested negative for HIV. The centre has been doing their best to assist wards and communes in the province to give normal lives to HIV bearers. Public awareness had also increased. ""Theres no more discrimination towards the HIV/AIDS bearers. Also they were more confident to use medicine for a normal life,"" Thuan said. Said Tran Thi Ngoc, the centres director: ""We set up a successful network of peer educators, various education programmes and a free medicine supply strategy."" Ngoc said free tests and friendliness from consultants at the centre had persuaded many people to test for HIV and consult over related information. Networks programmes have been developed in every ward and commune around the province, she said. Along with efforts from health staff, committee chairman Khuong said local authorities also had helped create more jobs in the commune, reducing the number moving to Laos for jobs. ""A total of 2,500 people are working in Laos and the number has been stable since 2009,"" he said. He noted that many people found they could earn well in their home village rather than moving to Laos for jobs. This measure had also helped prevent the appearance of new HIV cases in the locality. Now, Thuan is confident that locals are fully aware of HIV facts and he expects no more new case this year. â€” VNS",Society,"['cases', 'spread', 'publicity', 'laos', 'thien', 'hiv', 'hue', 'hivaids', 'thuan', 'efforts', 'thua', 'halt', 'workers', 'commune']","Peer educators collect needles in Loc Bon Commune, Thua Thien Hue Province.

Community ready to help HIV/AIDS children,The face of an eight-year old girl in a pink dress brightens when she talks about her class and her games with friends. She also likes singing.,[],2008-07-07,vietnamnews.vn,"Community ready to help HIV/AIDS children (08-07-2008) by Thu Hien Children living with HIV/AIDS study at the Social Labour Education Centre 2, in Ba Vi District. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc HA TAY â€” The face of an eight-year old girl in a pink dress brightens when she talks about her class and her games with friends. She also likes singing. Looking at her, no-one would imagine that this optimistic and happy girl, Nguyen Thi Xuan is living with HIV/AIDS. ""Everyday, I go to school with my closest friend, Hat. My classmates are very friendly and help me a lot,"" says Xuan. ""Thanks to the efforts of Ha Tay Province HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, the school and people in Phu Tuc Commune understand us and our disease,"" says Xuanâ€™s father adding that his neighbours show their sympathy and support in daily life. According to Nguyen Anh Quang, the director of Ha Tay Provinceâ€™s HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, Xuan and her younger sister have received the antiretroviral treatment (ART) at the Ha Noi Pediatrics Hospital. Doctors used antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to inhibit the replication of HIV. ""Our children also get free health insurance,"" notes Xuanâ€™s father. However, Xuan is one of the lucky few children living with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam who goes to school with other children and receives proper treatment; most parents with HIV/AIDS-infected children donâ€™t fully understand the illness and hide their childrenâ€™s disease. Difficulties Parents hiding the fact that their children are HIV positive make it hard to combat AIDS, according to Do Thi Nhan of the Ministry of Healthâ€™s HIV/AIDS Prevention Department. In the recent issuance of free health insurance for HIV/AIDS affected children in June, the department only received 1,300 application forms out of the estimated over 3,000 children infected with HIV that are eligible. And of those that applied, most parents withdrew their applications when asked to fill in their childrenâ€™s names and addresses. ""In the end, only 500 children with HIV/AIDS received free health insurance,"" says Nhan sorrowfully. ""Viet Nam has enough ARV drugs to treat every child with HIV/AIDS,"" says Chu Quoc An, the deputy head of HIV/AIDS Department. ""The problem is,"" Nhan adds, ""due to their parentsâ€™ reservations, pitifully few children get access to ARV drugs."" Furthermore, even when children get ARV drugs, few of them use the drugs properly as their parents or guardians often fail to comply with the rules of ART for children. Children with HIV/AIDS and their guardians need six rounds of training in how to use ARV drugs. This process is very complicated with a lot of stages. The drugs must be kept liquid so they can be injected at fixed points of time. Moreover, the volume of drugs changes flexibly after a few weeks depending on the side-effects of the drugs on children and the changes in the childrenâ€™s bodies. ""More than 50 per cent of children with HIV/AIDS are born into poor families and are treated by helpers who canâ€™t spend a lot of time with the children,"" says Nhan. In addition, ARV drugs must be stored in a refrigerator or else they lose all effectiveness. ""This seems to be a big barrier because in the poor living conditions, how they can afford to buy a refrigerator?"" asks Quang. Due to the help of health officials in Phu Tuc Commune, Xuanâ€™s father took her and her younger sister to Ha Noi Pediatrics Hospital so that they could get proper ART and guidance from experts in HIV/AIDS, which is why Xuan and her father are now in good health, Quang explains. Treating HIV/AIDS-infected children is important but equally vital is helping them integrate into the community, says An. According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, over 80 per cent of children living with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam have no chance to go to school due to the fact that parents of uninfected children worry that their children will become HIV-positive if they come into close contact. A group of children with HIV/AIDS in Social Labour Education Centre 2 in Ha Tay Provinceâ€™s Ba Vi District are a typical example: they were kicked out after just two weeks. ""We have enough knowledge to understand that HIV can not be transmitted through normal communication. However, children under 16 are too young to take adequate precautions,"" explains Nguyen Van Phu of Ba Vi District. People in Ba Vi still take care of HIV/AIDS-infected children from the centre, inviting them into their homes on the weekends. ""I can keep an eye on children when they play with each other at my house but whoâ€™ll ensure the safety of our children at school?"" asks Phu. According to Quang, the HIV-positive children are equipped with all necessary skills and knowledge about how to ensure the safety of others before theyâ€™re allowed to integrate into the community. ""However, easing the worries of parents in the community takes time. The first step is for us, the officials and authorities of the districts, to let our children study with children with HIV/AIDS,"" says Quang noting that, ""If we can prove to them that their children are safe, others will follow us."" ""I know my disease and also know how to ensure the safety for my classmates. I have never harmed them,"" says courageous Xuan. Greater efforts Clinics for children living with HIV/AIDS have been gradually established in the provinces of Viet Nam so that they can receive ART more easily and be taken care of by doctors. ""There are now 28 clinics in 17 provinces nation wide,"" says Nhan with pride. The ARV drugs are also available in various centres like the Social Labour Education Centre 2, Tam Binh Centre. ""To reduce the number of new children with HIV/AIDS, we have made efforts in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV because in Viet Nam, there are an estimated 100,000 HIV-positive women and many of them are of child-bearing age,"" says An.",Society,"['ready', 'arv', 'community', 'parents', 'school', 'living', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'health', 'centre', 'help', 'drugs', 'children']","Community ready to help HIV/AIDS children(08-07-2008)by Thu HienChildren living with HIV/AIDS study at the Social Labour Education Centre 2, in Ba Vi District.

Over 600 youth attended the camp. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Trang Duong CAN THO â€” Patients with HIV/AIDS are playing a dangerous game of hide and seek with healthcare workers in Can Tho Cityâ€™s AIDS Prevention Centre. ""People living with HIV and their families still bear a great inferiority complex,"" Dr Ta Kim Anh said. ""It hampers our work."" Dr Anh is part of the newly-established healthcare centre in the Mekong (Cuu Long) Delta region that has so far diagnosed 4,600 people in the community with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Eight hundred and fifty have died from AIDS. The struggling centre now is managing 1,300 people living with the virus; however, local authorities and health workers are worried about the number of people who unknowingly have the disease, or disappear after theyâ€™ve tested positive. The centreâ€™s director, Ta Kim Oanh, said: ""Only 40 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV return to the centre for advice and treatment."" Every month about 100 people take advantage of the centreâ€™s modern equipment and professional healthcare employees by getting examinations and seeking advice on how to live a fulfilling life with the virus. Others, however, give false identification and a bogus address when getting tested, then never return after theyâ€™ve tested positive. With 20 health workers, the centre gives advice to 1,200 cases by telephone or at the office every month. Seven doctors are each in charge of their own day of the week to run the entire centre. Bridging the gap Tran Thi Xuan Hong, head of Xuan Khanh Wardâ€™s health centre, who spent 20 years of her life helping AIDS patients, said she got accustomed to the faces and names of the many drug addicts and prostitutes living in the area. Hong believes the gap between the community and people living with HIV/AIDS is too wide, and causes patients to run away from the disease instead of learning about how to help control the spread. ""My ward reportedly has 71 AIDS patients, but this calculation is far from the real figure,"" she said. She took the case of a xe om (motorbike) driver, Nguyen Van S., who was diagnosed with HIV one year ago. ""I canâ€™t meet him to give advice because he hides from me and other healthcare workers,"" she said. ""There are many cases like S. in my region. We have to spend a lot of time finding them and persuading them to learn about how to keep close control of the spread of HIV to the rest of the community. Usually it doesnâ€™t work because people are too ashamed to learn about it."" Even the family of AIDS patients tend to keep a diagnosis or death secret, Hong said. But there is a substantial number of successes. The centre has got some drug users into rehabilitation programmes, and some work at production workshops while they receive free medicine at the centre. With only six health workers at Xuan Khanh Ward, Hong and her colleagues travel around the city once a week to give advice and distribute medicine to people living with HIV. ""P"", a drug addict who found out he was HIV-positive a year ago after he returned from Rau Ram prison in Long Tuyen District of Can Tho City, expressed suicidal thoughts when he met with the centreâ€™s employees. ""He contracted the virus through sharing needles with the 11 other drug addicts in his gang,"" Hong said. ""He didnâ€™t want to live with the constant spasms of pain anymore and was considering killing himself. But after we had a few therapy sessions with him, he decided there actually was a life awaiting him."" Eight districts of Can Tho City have health centres that give advice to people living with HIV.

Many pregnant women in the country are not aware that they are infected with HIV until they are diagnosed during labour or after birth. A 24-year-old pregnant woman from Nha Trang in the south-central province of KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a, for example, was diagnosed with HIV in the operating room prior to delivery. The woman had been advised to test for HIV infection during her pregnancy, but she had refused. After birth, the baby was given a preventive drug, and four weeks later, the infant tested positive for HIV. Dr Raphael Landovitz of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles, said it was â€œvery dangerous if pregnant women with HIV do not know their status and go without treatment.â€� â€œThe chance of infecting the baby is 25-30 per cent if untreated. In the case of treatment, the chances are small,â€� he said during an interview at a recent HIV research conference in Chicago. Dr DÆ° Táº¥n Quy of HCM Cityâ€™s Paediatrics Hospitalâ€™s Neurology and Infectious Diseases Ward said that the hospital had admitted nine children with HIV since the beginning of the year, an increase of two cases compared to the same period. Of these, six cases were from other provinces and the rest from the city, he said, adding that two of the nine children had died due to severe complications caused by HIV. In the first eight months of the year, seven new HIV infections were diagnosed among children, according to the HCM City AIDS/HIV Prevention Centre. Compared to the same period last year, the city has not seen an increase in the number of cases. During the same time period, the cityâ€™s hospitals admitted 15 new HIV-infected cases from other provinces and cities, a rise of four cases against the same period last year. Of the 15 cases, eight children died because HIV was detected too late. Dr TrÆ°Æ¡ng Há»¯u Khanh, head of the Paediatrics Hospitalâ€™s Neurology and Infectious Diseases Ward, warned that more serious measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV should be taken. â€œIf not, the rate will not continue to fall,â€� he said. Provincesâ€™ capabilities Dr Tráº§n Thá»‹ Ä�oan Trang, who is in charge of the AIDS/HIV Prevention Centreâ€™s programme on the prevention of mother-to-children transmission of HIV, said that many of the 15 pregnant women had never been tested for HIV. The 15 women were from provinces that lack funds and medical tools for HIV tests for pregnant women. Funds have also fallen because international aid for HIV testing to Viá»‡t Nam has been cut or reduced in recent years. Unlike HCM City, many provincial Peopleâ€™s Committees do not allocate funding for free tests, she said, adding that such tests are provided at district-level health facilities in HCM City. As the city cannot financially support the large number of pregnant women from neighbouring areas, the Ministry of Health has approved a plan by the HCM City Department of Health to collect fees for the tests at large obstetrics hospitals like Tá»« DÅ©, HÃ¹ng VÆ°Æ¡ng and others. HCM City is now integrating MTCT prevention into its reproductive health care. Trang said that more emphasis would be given to the importance of prenatal examinations, early HIV tests and anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. The rate of MTCT in HCM City is under 3 per cent, she said. Private health facilities Trang of the cityâ€™s AIDS/HIV Prevention Centre said that HIV tests for pregnant women were not available at many private health facilities. â€œThe centre has organised many workshops to provide information on the MCTC programme to private health facilities, but only several of them have attended,â€� she said. To carry out the programme more effectively at private health centres, she said the Department of Healthâ€™s division for private health facilities management should work with the Peopleâ€™s Committee and the Centre for Reproductive Healthcare. Catherine Hankins, deputy director of science at the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, said: â€œWe do not have a vaccine yet, so the best approach is to strengthen the offering of an HIV test in antenatal care and to strengthen antenatal care first, if needed.â€� All pregnant women should be offered the HIV test routinely at the first doctorâ€™s visit, she said. The father of the baby should also be offered the test at the same time, she said, adding that this could help identify HIV-negative women who are at risk from an HIV-positive regular partner. A second test should be taken later in pregnancy for those at ongoing risk (either from themselves or from their partners, who may be at risk from use of injected drugs or sex with other people). This can help women who tested negatively during the first test to receive anti-retroviral medication quickly, to protect both her health and the babyâ€™s. â€œAs for taking the medication, itâ€™s not just for pregnancy. It is taken for life,â€� she said. Hankins said that focus groups should be conducted in Viá»‡t Nam to discover what barriers and facilitators exist for women who must take the medicine regularly. At an HIV Research for Prevention conference held in Chicago in mid-October, promising early reports on antibodies that might reduce the need for anti-retroviral medication were presented. But these studies were in animals only, so more research is needed. Improving awareness Trang said that awareness about testing and medicine among pregnant women was still low. Of the seven babies born with HIV in the first eight months of the year in HCM City, four of the mothers had not taken their medicine as required. Temporarily stopping the use of medicine can lead to further resistance, Trang said, adding that the women need more community support and counselling from health centres about these issues. Community and health centres have been told to focus on raising awareness as well as the use of contraceptive methods as several women with HIV have had multiple pregnancies. At the HIV Research for Prevention conference in Chicago, experts also discussed the effectiveness of silicone vaginal rings for HIV prevention and a paediatric vaccine to prevent breast-milk transmission of HIV type 1. Engaging male partners and fathers as parents who want healthy children is also vital to continued success, according to UNAIDSâ€™s 2016 Prevention Gap report. Successfully engaging men in testing and treatment to prevent HIV transmission reduces the number of new infections in women, and the greater engagement of men can improve results at every step. Men need to be involved in family planning, with reproductive health positioned as the domain of both sexes, and more emphasis should be placed on promoting and facilitating couples testing, according to the report. Scientific advancements and experience have shown that immediate and lifelong antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women diagnosed with HIV is more effective than on-again, off-again approaches. In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that all pregnant women be provided with what WHO calls Option B+, an approach that involves an immediate offer of lifelong anti-retroviral therapy, going beyond pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding, regardless of the patientâ€™s CD4 white blood cell count. The global roll-out of Option B+ in 2015 improved suppression of viral loads during both the breastfeeding period and afterwards, making future pregnancies safer. Viá»‡t Nam is one of 10 countries in the Asia Pacific region (along with China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Thailand) that accounted for 96 per cent of the regionâ€™s new HIV infections in 2015. --VNS",Society,"['hcm', 'city', 'women', 'mothertochild', 'hiv', 'transmission', 'aims', 'cent', 'health', 'prevention', 'test', 'pregnant', 'reduce', 'govt', 'tests', 'rate']","Many pregnant women in the country are not aware that they are infected with HIV until they are diagnosed during labour or after birth.

Schools bar students with HIV,"As the new school year begins, some 40 youngsters with HIV at the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2 in Ba Vi, on the outskirts of Ha Noi, still long for the day when they can join mainstream education.",['Bich Huong'],2011-08-31,vietnamnews.vn,"by Bich Huong ""Living without discrimination"" reads one of the signs carried by students from Yen Bai Secondary School and the Ba Vi Centre for Social Education and Labour at the Colourful Rainbowl camp this month. â€” Photo courtesy Save the Children Viet Nam HA NOI â€” As the new school year begins, some 40 youngsters with HIV at the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2 in Ba Vi, on the outskirts of Ha Noi, still long for the day when they can join mainstream education. Quach Thi Mai, principal of Yen Bai B Primary School, said a lack of understanding about the disease had led to a great deal of prejudice and a reluctance among parents to let their children study alongside those with HIV. Mai said five children from the centre were allowed to attend 1st grade at her school four years ago but that they were forced to leave after a few days because of protests by parents of other schoolchildren. Angry parents even persuaded those who were not unduly concerned not to let their children study in the same class as pupils with HIV, Mai said. As a result, a class was opened at the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2, and two teachers from Yen Bai B Primary School were assigned to teach school-age pupils at the centre, Mai said. She added that there are two classes for 34 1st to 5th grade pupils. Over the last four years, the centres children have only been allowed to attend flag raising ceremonies at Yen Bai B Primary School on Mondays and a few other outdoor activities. ""They are just kids. They work and play together without any discrimination when parents do not intervene,"" Mai said. This year, five students graduated from the Centre for Social Education and Labour No 2, but none has so far been able to gain admission to a secondary school. Nguyen Thanh Dong, the principal of Yen Bai B Secondary School, said he had been forced to bar children with HIV from the school because of objections by parents, and was reluctant to send his teachers to the centre to teach children with HIV because of the inconvenience. He said parents needed to be won over. He said that could only happen if they were better informed about HIV/AIDS. Pham Dinh Duc, 11, one of the five teens to graduate from the Centre for Social Education and Labour, said his biggest dream was to find a place at a main-stream secondary school. Duc and a number of other pupils at the centre have responded well to treatment with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Although still HIV-positive, Duc said he and most of the other youngsters at the centre were fit enough to study at a ""normal"" school. Ducs friend at the centre, 17-year-old Uyen, has also successfully finished 5th grade. She, like he, longs to study with non-HIV children her own age. ""I spend all my time with them [other HIV-positive children at the centre], eating together, playing together and studying together. We have nothing new to talk about,"" she said. ""If I can go to a regular school, I will be in a class with my own teacher with students my own age. I would not have to share a teacher with younger students in the same class,"" she said. Nguyen Thi Minh, who has been a social worker at the centre for 10 years, said every youngster had expressed a desire at some time or another to go to a mainstream school. ""They ask me over and over again, â€˜why cant we go to school?"" She said it was heart-rending when they tearfully promised to obey their teachers, not to get in fights and not to infect other students. ""We have prepared every student here with the knowledge they need when they one day go to a regular school. They know what health precautions to take so as not to risk infecting other people,"" she said. Nguyen Trong An, deputy head of the Child Care and Protection Department under the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said too much had been written and said about HIV/AIDS and that the public had ""overdosed"", leading to fear and prejudice. ""Prejudice plus improper understanding has created a lot of hostility towards those with HIV/AIDS. Unfortunately that has made it difficult for those with the disease to integrate fully into society. Among the victims are innocent HIV/AIDS children,"" he said. According to the Health Ministry, at the end of last year, there were 184,000 HIV-positive people in Viet Nam. Of those, 44,000 had developed AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). Of the 4,400 children who were HIV-positive, 2,550 children had received ARV drugs. Prejudice In addition, they were often the victims prejudice and forced ""to live in deprived conditions and suffer the physical and psychological hurt of discrimination."" Unfortunately, An said the law was not being properly enforced and limited resources meant that services for those with HIV were sub-standard. Trinh Thi Le Tram, a medical doctor and director of the Legal Consultancy Centre for Health and HIV/AIDS, said those with HIV were legally entitled to study at a mainstream school. The Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and the Law on Child Care, Protection and Education clearly state that children with HIV/AIDS have the right to attend a regular school. Those that prevent them from doing so are breaking the law and should be punished, he said. Two Government decisions that came into effect last June and this month set fine levels of up to VND10 million (US$485) for those that impede or prevent HIV-positive children from attending a mainstream school. Tram added that the law should pave the way for HIV-positive children to participate fully in mainstream education. Nguyen Thi Kim Tien, director of the HCM City-based Linh Xuan Centre for Child Upbringing and Sponsoring, said better co-ordination between local authorities and schools was needed to ensure the rights of children with HIV/AIDS were protected. She said close co-operation between staff at the centre, the local authority and schools had been crucial to ensuring that those attending the Linh Xuan Centre had gained admission to a mainstream school over the last three years. Tien said that children with HIV attending a special centre stood out and were easily identifiable, whereas those living in the community could keep their condition secret. Tien said three years ago she had been forced to call the police after local residents protested outside the centre about HIV/AIDS students attending local schools. Instead of expelling children with HIV/AIDS, the schools management boards had instead accepted the right of parents to send their ""healthy"" children to other schools, Tien said, adding that all local schools were asked not to enrol those student. In the 2008-09 academic year, 26 children from the Linh Xuan Centre enrolled at a mainstream school, but their illness was known only to school staff to avoid discrimination, Tien added that in the past staff were often forced to lie to parents to protect HIV-positive students.",Society,"['social', 'parents', 'school', 'students', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'bar', 'schools', 'centre', 'hivpositive', 'mainstream', 'children']","""I spend all my time with them [other HIV-positive children at the centre], eating together, playing together and studying together.

For instance, despite three years of hard lobbying, sisters from the Mai Hoa AIDS Centre have been unable to keep their 15 orphans in local primary schools. The meeting comes a week after people who have children studying at the local An Nhon Dong and Trung Lap Ha Primary Schools protested against admitting the children from the centre and had them expelled. Dr Le Truong Giang, deputy head of committee, persuaded them to allow the centreâ€™s children to learn along with theirs and enable them to integrate into society. He told them that the HIV virus can be kept at bay easier than many others if people know how. Getting children with HIV to study at school is a policy of the Government and it is a right of the children, he said, but has been hard to achieve because of discrimination that persists despite information campaigns. Giang conceded that parentsâ€™ fears that their children could be infected is understandable but said helping them overcome the fear is important. The children from Mai Hoa AIDS Centre said they would love to go to school and acquire new friends and knowledge. N.H.D, a nine-year-old inmate of the centre, said he is bored of seeing the other inmates every day. Sister Nguyen Thi Bao of the Roman Catholic Church attached to the centre said it has 16 children to be put in school and two more will reach school-going age next year. She said wearily that it has become a hopeless attempt to send the children to school. ""Every time I go to school to do the paperwork and talk to the school authorities, the children are eager and cheerful but are disappointed and cry when I return with failure,"" she said. Recently the attitude of parents has improved but some remain worried. Bui Cao Tang, a resident of Got Chang hamlet, said: ""We are not selfish to stop the poor children from attending school. But who will be responsible if our children are infected after playing with the HIV positive children?"" Giang explained that the children would not be infected through normal contact and every school in HCM City would be required to have disinfectants in case the students suffer a scratch or other bleeding injuries. The cityâ€™s endeavour to fight discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is on the right track but for society to fully accept them could take a long time, he admitted. Bao said she would wait until December before taking the children to another school â€“ An Phu Dong Primary School â€“ but admitted that she has no hope.

Migrant construction workers at high risk of HIV,"Mobile workers are one of the groups at high risk of HIV/AIDS, experts said during a meeting about HIV education programmes for large infrastructure projects last Friday in HCM City.",[],2009-09-02,vietnamnews.vn,"Migrant construction workers at high risk of HIV (03-09-2009) HCM CITY â€” Mobile workers are one of the groups at high risk of HIV/AIDS, experts said during a meeting about HIV education programmes for large infrastructure projects last Friday in HCM City. Intravenous drug users and sex workers are most at risk of contracting HIV, but migrant workers and managers, who usually work away from home for long periods at major construction projects, are also at high risk of catching the virus, according to the project manager of non-government organisation, PACT, Nguyen Anh Thuan, adding local residents would also be impacted. Viet Namâ€™s rapid economic development and growth had resulted in increased levels of mobility within the country and large populations of migrant workers, experts said after the meeting. Viet Nam should prioritise HIV prevention programmes for workers and residents near major infrastructure projects because migrant workers on the sites lived far from their families and had sexual needs met by sex workers, Thuan said. ""Contractors should be responsible to enhance awareness about HIV/AIDS among the workers,"" Thuan stressed. Helpful tool kit The World Bank is sponsoring PACT to do a baseline study for US$40,000 to adapt an information toolkit to help prevent HIV in migrant workers at these sites. The study is an initial step to limit HIV infection among workers, sex workers and the community at big infrastructure projects, following World Bankâ€™s recent decision to recommend that such projects worth over $10 million should include a HIV/AIDS prevention toolkit in their budget. Thuan said the toolkit was conducted and piloted at large-scale construction projects in China, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea. PACT Viet Nam aims to conduct the baseline survey at some construction projects in Ca Mau Province to adapt the existing toolkit entitled The Road to Good Health and pilot the draft toolkit so that people can study more about HIV and how to protect themselves. ""Most building contractors pay attention to workersâ€™ safety but donâ€™t pay attention to risks they face from HIV,"" Thuan said. Once the six-chapter toolkit has been adapted to Viet Namâ€™s needs, it will be applied to other construction projects around the country next year. Hoang Anh Dung, a representative from Transport Sector of World Bank Viet Nam, said the province was chosen for studying and piloting the HIV prevention toolkit in Viet Nam because there were many workers from the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta who went there to work. There were six bridge construction packages there and up to 70 workers on each site, Dung said. Agreement reached In 2006, six development agencies including the World Bank, Asia Development Bank, African Development Bank, the UKâ€™s Department for International Development (DFID), the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (now Japan International Co-operation Agency JICA) and KfW Development Bank made an agreement to recommend that infrastructure construction contractors conduct HIV/AIDS awareness programme to reduce risks of HIV transmission among contractorsâ€™ personnel and the local community.

Further, nearly 50 per cent of the districts nationwide have established HIV/AIDS treatment centres, while more than 500 health clinics in communes provided ARV drugs for patients, ten years after HIV programs were introduced. Additionally, the prevention of mother-to-baby transmission of HIV has been carried out throughout the country. About 70 per cent of pregnant women are tested for HIV and receive early treatments, if needed, with 96.8 per cent of HIV-positive mothers giving birth to healthy babies. Today, Centres for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control have been set up in 62 cities and provinces and as many as 1,300 of the nations hospitals and health centres conduct HIV tests, he said. Also, 47 of the 63 provinces and cities in the country have provided treatment using methadone to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS among drug users this year.

He called on the Government, NGOs, the community and transgender people to help reduce the rate of HIV prevalence among transgender women, and achieving the UNâ€™s 90-90-90 Goals in HIV/AIDS prevention and control by 2020.

Ä�á»— VÄƒn DÅ©ng, vice rector of the university and head of the research group, said the cross-sectional study was conducted among 456 transgender women in HCM City from February to May this year. The study used respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). It found that 77 of 456 transgender women were living with HIV, accounting for 16.5 per cent of the total interviewed. About 67.3 per cent of the people living with HIV were receiving anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy. However, most transgender women said they had not used pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs. The survey found that more than 50 per cent of the respondents had previously contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD). More than 40 per cent of those surveyed said they have regular sex with male partners, and 55 per cent said they were not regularly using condoms within 30 days prior to the study. About 25 per cent of people said they received payment for sex with men who were not their regular sex partners, 53 per cent of them not using condoms regularly, the survey found. Factors that contribute to HIV transmission among transgender women consist of non-use of condoms; drinking more than four units of alcohol; use of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) before sex; and incidents related to gender inequality and social discrimination. â€œSevere social stigma and discrimination may create barriers to accessing HIV testing and treatment services,â€� one transgender woman told the researchers. The study recommended that untreated HIV-infected people should have better access to treatment and healthcare services related to PrEP and STDs. Developing effective strategies and enhancing interventions are also needed to raise awareness in the transgender community of the proper use of condoms, alcohol, and ATS. â€œProgrammes on preventing discrimination against transgender women living with HIV should promote gender equality in healthcare services,â€� DÅ©ng said.

Ä�Ã´n said that the 35 were given free antiretroviral (ARV) medicine 24 hours post-exposure, earlier than the recommended time frame of 72 hours.

The HIV-infected victim had been receiving ARV treatment on a regular basis, Ä�Ã´n said, so the concentration of the virus in her bodily fluids was very low. ARV scandal One of the local residents who took the HIV patient to the hospital on Saturday morning wrote a Facebook post, complaining that he was asked to buy the ARV medicine at VNÄ�5 million (US$220). The Facebook account user, Le Tung, said that he used his familyâ€™s truck to help take eight victims of the accident to the hospital, one of whom was dead with an open wound. While lifting her to the truck, her blood was smeared onto a scratch on his body. After learning that she was HIV positive, he went to a hospital asking for the ARV medicine. â€œBut a doctor there said that the medicine was not for ordinary folks but public servants only. I who saved people will have to pay VNÄ�5 million a (ARV) drink. May I ask who still dares to save people or do we just let the authorities do the saving work?â€� Tung wrote.

The film titled Coming Home is about a man named An who meets and falls in love with Lam at a birthday party. They have sex and later it is revealed via lab tests that An has HIV. Lam, who was the person who transmitted the virus, abandons An. Worse, his family also shun him. Nguyen Anh Phong, a representative of Viet Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in southern region (VNP+), said that VNP+ made the film in cooperation with local actors and producers to raise public awareness about discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, especially high-risk groups including those in the LGBT community. Phong said the LGBT community with HIV/AIDS suffers from double discrimination because of their gender and the disease. Their families often ignore them, and as a result, they hide the disease and refuse ARV treatment because they are afraid of being revealed, he said. Last year, a 27-year-old MSM (Men having sex with Men) who had HIV died because he refused treatment at a nearby community support and counselling centre, afraid that his family and friends would see him visiting the centre. Benny Nguyen (his nickname), head of Song That (True Live) Group, which provides counselling on HIV preventive methods and treatment for MSM in the city, said that as MSM, the public, especially family members, abandon or shun them. ""It is more difficult when they are infected with HIV. There is nowhere for them to go. They need sympathy and encouragement from their family,"" he added. Family is needed for moral support so they will follow their treatment regimen, he said. As of September 30 last year, there were more than 224,000 people with HIV in the country, including more than 66,900 AIDS patients. MSM is one of the high-risk groups vulnerable to HIV infection, according to the Ministry of Health. The film is part of VNP+s Dai Bang Do (Red Ribbon) events, which call on the elimination of discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. It also aims to honour people who have made silent contributions to HIV/AIDS prevention in the country. The Red Ribbon events are sponsored by the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control and the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

People with HIV lack legal aid,"Strengthening legal aid to people living with HIV/AIDS is expected to help them better exercise their rights and receive essential services, it was heard at a conference by Ha Noi-based Centre for the Law, Healthcare and HIV/AIDS Policies under the Viet Nam Bar Association this week.",[],2016-03-05,vietnamnews.vn,"HA NOI (VNS)â€” Strengthening legal aid to people living with HIV/AIDS is expected to help them better exercise their rights and receive essential services, it was heard at a conference by Ha Noi-based Centre for the Law, Healthcare and HIV/AIDS Policies under the Viet Nam Bar Association this week. Speaking at the conference, the centres director, Trinh Thi Le Tram, said few people living with HIV in Viet Nam knew or understood the law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, and this prevented them from exercising their rights. Few had ever received services like legal consultation or legal aid, she said, adding that few lawyers offered these services. Under the current law on legal aid, people living with HIV are not considered official beneficiaries to receive aid. They are instead listed as people with disabilities and have no one to rely on. Shortcomings in offering aid were also revealed at the States legal aid centres based at municipal and provincial Justice Department offices, she said. Those who wanted access to legal aid had to show HIV-positive results, reveal their names and go to a State agencys office, which made them afraid and hesitant, Tram said. She called for support from agencies and lawyers to promote legal aid to those living with HIV. The Government was asked to offer funding to civil societies like Trams centre to better reach out to HIV carriers and offer effective aid, she said. Dr Kristan Schoultz, UNAIDS Viet Nam Country Director, said people living with HIV should be able to access a wide range of legal aid services, including legal education, legal assistance, representation in civil, criminal and administrative cases, and litigation. She said although Viet Nam had legal regulations to protect the rights and legal interests of people living with HIV, stigma, discrimination and associated rights violations were still common in healthcare facilities, workplaces and the wider community. ""Many people living with HIV who suffer discrimination and rights violations do not seek help because they are afraid and feel they have nowhere to turn for protection,"" she said. Hoang Thi Bich Ngoc, a HIV-positive state employee in northern Dien Bien Province shared at the conference that her managers suggested she resign her job after they discovered she was HIV positive. She was advised to ""accept her fate"" and ""quit her job"" when she asked for assistance from local trade union and healthcare officials, she said. ""Tram and her colleagues helped me understand my rights and I still do my job,"" she said, adding that her managers were still unhappy to have her there. According to a survey in 2014 by the Viet Nam National Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, 11 per cent of about 1,600 respondents of people living with HIV in HCM City, Ha Noi, Can Tho, Hai Phong and Dien Bien provinces, said their rights had been violated. They experienced gossip and insults, were excluded from social activities and sometimes lost their jobs. However, 94 per cent of respondents who had their rights violated said that they did not seek legal assistance as they didnt believe it would help. â€” VNS",Society,"['aid', 'law', 'lack', 'services', 'living', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'rights', 'legal']","Few had ever received services like legal consultation or legal aid, she said, adding that few lawyers offered these services.

Dr Le Truong Giang, deputy head of the city Department of Health and deputy head of the HCM City AIDS Preventive Committee, said the city might offer free health care to patients but what was needed more was sympathy and understanding among people. Helping HIV patients join the mainstream and attend school like everyone else was the responsibility of the education sector and public, he said, pointing out most children with HIV studied by themselves in orphanages.

Dr Nguyen Thi Bich Hong of the HCM City Pedagogy University said it was a big challenge for the education sector to fight against the discrimination because many teachers and students were afraid of being infected due to contact with victims.

People at high risk of HIV infection can buy this product and test themselves at home, getting results in as little as 15 minutes.

At a recent workshop in Hai Phong on HIV/AIDS control policies, Dang Thuan Phong, Vice Chairman of the National Assemblys Committee for Social Affairs, noted a decrease in foreign aid for HIV/AIDS control, as Viet Nam enters the group of middle-income countries. He said the government was also planning to abolish the national target programme on preventing and fighting HIV/AIDS, drugs and prostitution, which meant these social problems would no longer be prioritised for investment. Meanwhile, Viet Nam continues to raise its targets in HIV/AIDS control, with antiretroviral treatment planned for 100,000 HIV carriers, from the current 48,000 receiving treatment, and Methadone therapy for 80,000 drug users, up from the 16,000 now receiving the therapy, by the end of next year. Phong said efforts to control HIV/AIDS have so far helped to reduce the infection rate to under 0.3 per cent of the population, and the numbers of new infections and cases of AIDS developing from HIV have likewise decreased. Kristan Shoultz, UNAIDS Viet Nam Country Director, suggested that the country maintain current initiatives and take further drastic action to sustain the results of the past 15-year effort in HIV/AIDS control. She said the UNAIDSs initiative on a strategic investment case for HIV aimed to determine effective tools in allocating and optimising all resources for HIV/AIDS control activities.

Long also said highly-vulnerable areas and the most vulnerable groups should be given priority in investment, while central and local budgets for HIV/AIDS prevention should be maintained. Promoting health insurance participation nationwide and increasing non-State investment in health services are also solutions to helping control the problem, Long added. â€” VNS",Society,"['aid', 'national', 'fight', 'reductions', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'cut', 'foreign', 'budget', 'efforts', 'phong', 'control', 'investment']","Concern is growing as foreign aid decreases and the government plans to deprioritise investment for HIV/AIDS control. â€”VNA/VNS Photo Duong NgocHAI PHONG (VNS) â€” Decreasing foreign aid and the government plan to deprioritise investment for HIV/AIDS control is seen as growing concerns in the fight against the deadly disease, a government official said.

Tran Van Lanh, one of the recipients of the project in HCM City, was able to start his own cleaning service after borrowing VND20 million (nearly $1,000). However, for similar models to be replicated in Viet Nam, Natilson said theres a need for more co-ordinated efforts among micro-finance institutions and AIDS support organisations, in addition to further support from the Government.

The project plans to provide free legal aid to those already infected with HIV and those who are particularly vulnerable to being exposed to the disease, including drug users, sex workers, transgender and homosexuals. In Viá»‡t Nam, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse has become the most common method of transmission, with the number of new cases due to sexual activity surging from 12 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2013, according to the Ministry of Health. â€œVulnerable groups tend to have little legal knowledge so they easily fall prey to abuse without even knowing about it.

A survey by the centre shows that about 75.9 per cent of HIV-positive people never sought public legal consultancy services, offered by the Government under the Law on Legal Aid issued in 2007. Reasons for the low figure of people seeking help at public legal aid centres might lie in their stringent rule requiring the publication of personal identities, or their locations. Public legal aid centres also lacked either separate rooms in which to offer services or legal consultants qualified in working with HIV-infected patients and HIV-vulnerable groups who suffer heavily from social stigma and discrimination, TrÃ¢m said. â€œMoreover, drug users, sex workers and homosexuals are not subject to free legal support from the Government,â€� she said.

Police on the beat face threat of HIV,"Many policemen are silently suffering from the effects of exposure to HIV. Their struggle against invisible wounds is as tough as the fight against dangerous criminals, since it affects their families as well.",[],2007-08-01,vietnamnews.vn,"Police on the beat face threat of HIV (02-08-2007) HA NOI â€” Many policemen are silently suffering from the effects of exposure to HIV. Their struggle against invisible wounds is as tough as the fight against dangerous criminals, since it affects their families as well. Five policemen at the anti-drug police picket in Ha Noiâ€™s Dong Da District had to receive treatment for HIV exposure after surrounding and arresting an HIV infected drug trafficker a year ago. However their loved ones continue to worry about their health. The mother in law of one young policeman, Ha Viet Trung, said: ""Trungâ€™s wife is pregnant now and we still feel insecure because of the side effects of anti-retroviral drugs (ARV)."" Trung was injured, forcing him to take ARV when he was about to get married. Deputy chief of the anti-drug police picket, major Bui Anh Loi who also took part in the drug traffickerâ€™s arrest, Nguyen Van Binh, remembers: ""In the beginning, affected policemen were very tired and lost weight because of anxiety and taking ARV."" Asked if fear of HIV exposure would hold them back from their duties, Loi said with a smile: ""It is our mission; in a life and death struggle you must exchange your hesitation for a human life."" Yet experience has shown that some of the protective equipment available is inconvenient and impractical for most policemen. At a recent crackdown of a drug den in Luong Su A alley in Ha Noi on July 4, Dong Da anti-drug police picket were ordered to arrest an AIDS infected drug trafficker. As the specialised gloves they were given were too big and tough, they were forced to apprehend the offender with unprotected hands. Inappropriate policy According to lieutenant colonel Lai Van An, head of political and logistic squad at Dong Da districtâ€™s police, the district foils about 400 drug cases a year. Many offenders who are living with HIV resist the police with violence. ""The danger to HIV exposure is high,"" An said. Since 2003 the district police has had 28 policemen exposed to HIV and five new cases have been reported since the beginning of this year alone. Statistics released by the Ministry of Public Security show that in the past five years more than 300 officials and policemen have become infected by the HIV when arresting offenders. Some were infected and then transmitted the virus on to their wives. The case of lieutenant Nguyen Thanh Dung, a criminal policeman in HCM City, is a typical example. Thanh and his wife passed away after Thanh caught the virus after arresting HIV/AIDS offenders. They left behind a 10 year old son. ""Regulations concerning compensation to policemen exposed to HIV are generally unsatisfactory,"" An opined. Under existing regulations which came into force last year, officials and policemen who are exposed to HIV are prescribed ARV free of charge and sometimes receive subsidies of between VND1 and VND2 million. It is, however, inadequate cover for the increasingly weakened health of infected policemen or the adverse impacts on their families. An said despite the fact that HIV, after treatment, only becomes AIDS in less than 0.01 percent of cases policemen exposed to HIV could not help worrying about their health He cited the case of a policeman who was scratched after arresting an HIV offender. The policeman did neither dare to discuss it with anyone nor have sexual intercourse with his wife for fear of transmitting the virus for two years. He only admitted the truth after a second scratch. None of the officials and policemen who were exposed to HIV at Dong Da District have been recognised as wounded soldiers because the degree of their injuries was not serious enough to assess. Therefore one of the tasks of the Dong Da political and logistic squad is to set up incident files and keep a close watch on the numbers of HIV infected officials and policemen. By doing so, it wants to help these officials and policemen to receive compensation when they are sick.",Society,"['policeman', 'threat', 'policemen', 'hiv', 'officials', 'face', 'beat', 'drug', 'exposure', 'infected', 'dong', 'exposed', 'da']","Police on the beat face threat of HIV(02-08-2007)HA NOI â€” Many policemen are silently suffering from the effects of exposure to HIV.

"HIV/AIDS patients reluctant to buy health insurance, fear discrimination",Health insurance has become critically important for HIV/AIDS patients as free anti-retroviral medicine and testing will no longer be readily available because of reduced international aid.,[],2015-10-30,vietnamnews.vn,"People living with HIV seeks consulting service at the Tropical Diseases Centre of the central Nghe An General Hospital. â€” Photo giadinh.net.vn Gia Loc HCM CITY (VNS) â€” Health insurance has become critically important for HIV/AIDS patients as free anti-retroviral medicine and testing will no longer be readily available because of reduced international aid. Because of Viet Nams classification as a lower middle-income country by the UN, funds from international aids will continue to fall, and eventually, patients with HIV/AIDS will have to pay for treatment. Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the countrys HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, said that health insurance would help reduce the patients payments. However, only 30 per cent of patients with HIV/AIDS buy insurance, and in HCM City, the figure is 20-25 per cent, according to the city AIDS Prevention Committee. As of this year, HCM City has 41,841 people with HIV. Venerable Thich Dong Nguyen, director of Phap Bao Community Counseling and Support Centre, said that many HIV/AIDS patients who receive counseling at his centre wanted to buy health insurance, but had not done so because of the stigma attached to the disease. ""Theyre afraid that many people will find out about their disease,"" he said. Most patients from other provinces and cities come to HCM City to earn a living, and many of them are casual labourers with an unstable income. To buy health insurance, they have to have temporary residential registration papers. Nguyen said that one patient with HIV/AIDS told him that he had to borrow papers from his landlord, who asked why he needed to do so. The patient told him that he had HIV and needed to buy health insurance, and as a result, the landlord no longer allowed him to live there. ""Discrimination by the community and even patients with HIV/AIDS have created these problems,"" Nguyen said. The amended Health Insurance Law on health insurance is also a barrier for HIV/AIDS patients. The law, which took effect earlier this year, requires that insurance must be bought for all members of a family. Tran Thi Phung of the Niem Tin community-based organisation (CBO), which provides healthcare and counselling to HIV patients, said that many women and children chose to stay at home or work as casual labourers because of poor health. ""They cant afford to buy health insurance cards for themselves, which cost VND600,000-700,000 ($27-31) each. Its even more difficult to buy for the whole family,"" she said. At an HIV outpatient clinic in District 4, of more than 1,200 patients with HIV, only 30 per cent have health insurance cards. Most of them work, but are poor or near-poor. Nguyen said the Ministry of Health should simplify health-insurance procedures, and allow HIV/AIDS patients to buy insurance at the HIV outpatient clinics. Dr Tieu Thi Thu Van, head of the citys AIDS Prevention Committee, has asked the central government to streamline the policy and allow HIV/AIDS patients to buy cards on their own. Access to benefits In June, the Ministry of Health issued a list of medical services paid by the Social Insurance Agency, but the list still does not provide sufficient services to insured HIV/AIDS patients. In HCM City, for example, 90 per cent of patients with HIV are treated at HIV outpatient clinics at district preventive health centres. However, the Social Insurance Agency, under the recently amended Health Insurance Law, is not allowed to sign insurance contracts for treatment at these centres as they are not legally covered under the law. Under the law, they can only sign agreements for payments to hospitals. As a result, insured patients with HIV treated at the centres receive no coverage. However, district hospitals and general hospitals in HCM City can only provide testing, and do not offer treatment for these patients. The patients are sent to specialised hospitals, such as Nhan Ai, Chi Hoa, Pham Ngoc Thach, paediatrics hospitals No.1 and 2 and the Tropical Diseases Hospital. Social welfare centres also provide treatment for them. Another problem under the amended law is that patients must go to a hospital that is named on their health insurance card. To solve these discrepancies, insured patients treated at district- or commune-level health facilities will be covered by health insurance in January next year, under regulations of the amended Health Insurance Law. HCM City plans to expand anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy to general district hospitals and private hospitals between 2016 and 2020. At that time, the city is considering two options to solve the coverage problem. One option involves sending patients with HIV/AIDS at district preventive centres to district general hospitals for treatment. The city would transfer the staff specialising in HIV/AIDS at the centres to hospitals, which offer insurance coverage under the amended Health Insurance Law. Patients treatment fees would then be paid by the Social Insurance Agency. The second option would be to classify district preventive health centres as ""health centres"", which would allow the centres to sign agreements with the national Social Insurance Agency as prescribed by the amended Health Insurance law. Thus, patients with HIV/AIDS could be covered at these centres. Under the citys proposal, social welfare centres that offer treatment now to HIV patients would be classified as satellite health facilities of district general hospitals. The patients would then qualify for insurance coverage. â€” VNS",Society,"['law', 'patients', 'city', 'hospitals', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'centres', 'discrimination', 'buy', 'reluctant', 'district', 'fear', 'health', 'insurance']","Nguyen Hoang Long, head of the country's HIV/AIDS Prevention Department, said that health insurance would help reduce the patients' payments.

Experts emphasise gender equality in VNâ€™s HIV response,The current national response to HIV fails to adequately respond to the diverse needs and rights of the main affected groups â€“ women and girls.,[],2018-01-18,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” The current national response to HIV fails to adequately respond to the diverse needs and rights of the main affected groups â€“ women and girls. Phan Thá»‹ Thu HÆ°Æ¡ng, deputy director of the Viá»‡t Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), made the statement at a conference held yesterday in HÃ  Ná»™i. Although Viá»‡t Namâ€™s programmes of coping with HIV marked achievements in four fields including prevention, treatment, discrimination prevention and improving on challenges related to gender inequality, it still needed to take more action to ensure that women receive enough help, she said. Speaking at the workshop, Elisa Fernandez, UN Women Head of Office said, â€œWomen living with HIV face gaps and constraints in accessing prevention, treatment, care and support services. Women, particularly those most affected by the epidemic, also largely remain on the margins of policy and decision-making spaces.â€� These are some of the reasons why there is a rise in reported cases of HIV-positive women in Viá»‡t Nam from 24 per cent in 2007 to 33 per cent in 2014. â€œTo achieve gender equality and empowerment of women and girls, HIV response needs to focus on three areas,â€� Fernandez said. First, improving access to sexual and reproductive health and HIV services. Second, mobilising communities to transform unequal gender norms and behaviours, particularly by engaging men. Third, empowering women and girls in all their diversity by investing in womenâ€™s leadership in HIV response, she said. Deputy director HÆ°Æ¡ng emphasised that in the future, the Ministry of Health (MoH) would improve education on HIV/AIDS prevention and control, especially for women and children, in which they will prevent discrimination against people living with HIV. The MoH will improve womenâ€™s access to equipment to reduce the spread of HIV, including condoms, and give more training to consultancy workers to help women and girls resolve their problems related to tests, diagnosis and personal information security. During the half-day workshop, more than 80 participants from international organisations, governmental agencies, academia, civil society and other stakeholders discussed key findings of the VAAC study, identified the gaps and challenges in mainstreaming gender equality and empowering women in the national HIV response, and provided a set of recommendations for improved HIV policies and programmes. Viá»‡t Nam was committed to ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 and had demonstrated political leadership and commitment to join global efforts to address gender inequality and HIV. By September last year, Viá»‡t Nam has 208,371 people living with HIV, more than 90,400 people living with AIDS and 90,000 people died of HIV/AIDS, according to the VAAC. In the nine first months last year, the country discovered more than 6,800 people living with HIV, more than 3,400 people living with AIDS and 1,260 people died of HIV/AIDS.

Over half of HIV-afflicted on life-saving treatment: UNAIDS,"More than half of those living with HIV have access to treatment, while AIDS-related deaths have almost halved in the past 10 years in the world, a new report has stated.",[],2017-07-21,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” More than half of those living with HIV have access to treatment, while AIDS-related deaths have almost halved in the past 10 years in the world, a new report has stated. In Viá»‡t Nam, half of the people living with HIV were under treatment in 2016, and the estimated number of AIDS-related deaths was the lowest since 2004. New HIV infections have also steadily decreased in recent years, it said. The report, which has been launched by UNAIDS on Thursday, showed that in 2016, 19.5 million people living with HIV had access to treatment, and AIDS-related deaths had fallen from 1.9 million in 2005 to 1 million in 2016. In Asia and the Pacific, more than two thirds of the people living with HIV were aware of their HIV status, a similar number of those who knew their HIV status were on treatment and four out of the five people under treatment had achieved viral suppression in 2016. The wider availability of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment has led to nearly one third reduction in AIDS-related deaths since 2010 in the region. Viá»‡t Nam has significantly contributed to this progress. â€œViá»‡t Namâ€™s impressive scale-up of HIV services has resulted in a clear impact on the epidemic,â€� said Marie-Odile Emond, Country Director of UNAIDS Viá»‡t Nam. New infections are declining, but not fast enough. Global and Viá»‡t Namâ€™s progress against the 90â€“90â€“90 targets has been significant, but there is still more work to do. The report shows that, globally, new HIV infections are declining, but not at enough pace to meet global targets by 2020. The situation in Viá»‡t Nam is similar. New HIV infections in Viá»‡t Nam have decreased to about 11,000 in 2016 from about 28,000 during the peak years in the early 2000s. However, greater scale-up of evidence-based prevention and more domestic resources for prevention, including needle, syringes and condoms, are needed to achieve the national targets on HIV prevention. Integrated and community-based HIV services, as well as successful innovative and user-friendly approaches, are essential for greater HIV service access and uptake by key populations, and must be scaled up. In Viá»‡t Nam, of the 70 per cent of people living with HIV who know their HIV status, one third is not on HIV treatment yet. Stigma and discrimination is still a major barrier in accessing HIV services and hampering the national response to HIV. Globally, resources for AIDS response remain flat. In Viá»‡t Nam, the latest available data shows domestic resources accounted for nearly one third of the national AIDS spending in 2015, and it is increasing. â€œViá»‡t Nam continues to show great determination to sustain the response to HIV by increasing domestic financing for HIV through social health insurance and greater share in the financing responsibility by local governments,â€� Emond said. â€œInvesting sufficiently and wisely, now rather than later, and optimising all available financial and human resources at all levels will help Viá»‡t Nam avoid a complex and costly HIV response in the future, and end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.â€� â€” VNS",Society,"['response', 'resources', 'viá»‡t', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'aidsrelated', 'infections', 'deaths', 'half', 'unaids', 'hivafflicted', 'treatment', 'lifesaving']","In Viá»‡t Nam, half of the people living with HIV were under treatment in 2016, and the estimated number of AIDS-related deaths was the lowest since 2004.

Treatment programme cuts HIV transmission rate,"A 25-year-old mother from HCM City's Binh Thanh District was unsure about what to do when she became pregnant as she had contracted the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from her husband, who had once been a user of recreational drugs.",[],2014-06-03,vietnamnews.vn,"According to the World Health Organisation, in the absence of any intervention, transmission rates to the child can range from 15-45 per cent. The rate can fall below 5 per cent with effective intervention. â€” Photo dantri by Gia Loc HCM CITY (VNS) â€” A 25-year-old mother from HCM Citys Binh Thanh District was unsure about what to do when she became pregnant as she had contracted the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from her husband, who had once been a user of recreational drugs. Nguyen Thi Thanh Thao (not her real name) said that her mother-in-law had suggested an abortion. To resolve the matter, Thao and her family visited the Phat Tam HIV/AIDS Prevention Division in Binh Thanh Districts Ward 21 for counselling. The division is part of the HCM City AIDS Prevention Committee. There, they met Truong Ngoc Nhu, the divisions head who persuaded Thao to continue her pregnancy and take part in a programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Thao was introduced to the Community Support and Counselling Centre in Binh Thanh District. Pregnant women who have HIV and are 14 weeks pregnant are eligible for the prevention programme if their CD4 cell count, the type of white blood cell that fights infection, is more than 350. If it is less than 350, then they qualify for the anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment programme. Thao was given medicine two times a day until the end of the first week after delivery. Thaos son also was provided medicine at delivery and until he was one month old. He was also provided formula milk and was not breast-fed. When he was one month old, he was brought to the citys Paediatrics Hospital No. 2 for HIV tests, which were negative. Like Thaos son, the son of 44-year-old HIV-positive mother Phan Thi Anh Tuyet (not her real name) has been free of HIV also, tests results show. The thin mother with pale skin, who rents a room of only six square metres, takes care of her child with her husband. Tuyet said she had never been tested for HIV until she went into labour. Tests were positive and she received medication under the citys mother-to-child prevention programme. Her sons tests at Paediatrics Hospital No. 2 proved to be negative. According to the World Health Organisation, in the absence of any intervention, transmission rates to the child can range from 15-45 per cent. The rate can fall below 5 per cent with effective intervention. Truong Huu Khanh, a member of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Controls Division for HIV/AIDS among Children, said the citys mother-to-child transmission prevention programme was the best in the country. Last year, the city recorded a total of 642 pregnant women infected with HIV. Of them, 588 accessed the prevention programme during pregnancy, labour and delivery, and 80.8 per cent received early prevention during pregnancy. The rest was for labour and delivery. The city said that 99.7 per cent of babies received prevention measures after delivery in 2013. As a result, the city HIV transmission from mother to child or breastfeeding fall to 2.3 per cent in 2013 from 6.9 per cent in 2006. An initial evaluation of the effectiveness of prevention treatment of HIV transmission from mother to child at the National Gyneco-Obstetrics Hospital in Ha Noi between October 2010 and June 2011 showed that the rate of transmission was 1.49 per cent. Lifelong prevention Dr Tran Thi Doan Trang, a specialist in the prevention programme and a member of HCM City AIDS Committee, said that the Ministry of Health had approved HCM City AIDS Prevention Committee to carry out a lifelong anti-retroviral (ARVs) treatment for all HIV-positive pregnant women, regardless of their CD4 cell count. The lifelong treatment is known as Option B+, she said. Previously, pregnant women with HIV received the ARV treatment when their CD4 count was under 350. If the CD4 count was more than 350 in post-pregnancy, the treatment would end. Last November, the Option B+ pilot programme began in the provinces of An Giang, Quang Ninh, Thai Nguyen, Thanh Hoa, Lao Cai and Nghe An, she added. The treatment was recommended by the World Health Organisation last year. Le Truong Giang, chairman of the citys Public Health Association, said the Option B+ would help end HIV transmission from mother to child within the next two years. Khanh said it would help protect babies from HIV transmission, and lead to elimination of new HIV infections among children. Option B+ would also improve pregnant womens resistance to disease, and it could also prevent sexual transmission to sero-discordant partners. ""It is very important to be very safe for babies, and for it to not be costly,"" said Khanh. The simplification of the daily regimen, with a single-pill fixed dose combination, would help prevent women from giving up too early, especially women in HCM Citys rural areas, Khanh said. In late 2011, the Option B+ programme was carried out throughout Malawi in Africa. After only three months, Malawi saw very positive results, with the total number of all patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in the national programme increasing by an astounding 88 per cent. A research report of the cost-effective analysis of Option B+ for HIV Prevention and Treatment of Mother and Children in Malawi published last March showed that the Option B+ not only prevented infant infection but also improved the 10-year survival rate in mothers more than four-fold. This translates into savings of more than 250,000 maternal life years, compared to different prevention and treatment measures related to CD4 cell count, which have savings of 153,000 to 172,000 life-years. The Option B+ also yields favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$455 per life each year compared to current practices. The research study was conducted by Malawis Ministry of Healths HIV and AIDS Department in co-operation with local and foreign organisations and universities. â€” VNS",Society,"['city', 'hiv', 'option', 'cuts', 'transmission', 'prevention', 'cent', 'programme', 'mother', 'treatment', 'rate', 'b']","If it is less than 350, then they qualify for the anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment programme.

In an update on the virus spread in Viet Nam, the Ministry said that as of October this year, there were over 200,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, of which more than 65,000 had developed AIDS. Around 66,000 people died from HIV/AIDS in the same period. Bui Hoang Duc, from the ministrys Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said that although the pandemic had declined in recent years, the numbers were still relatively high. The ratio of women with HIV has increased during the past years, with the number of sexually transmitted HIV infections outnumbering those via blood-to-blood contact. According to the ministry, the proportion of people over 30 and living with HIV was also on the rise. However, Duc said the ministry was especially concerned about a large number of people with HIV being unaware of their condition; posing a huge threat to the community and threatening a rise in infection rates. An increasing number of cases had been discovered in drug addicts partners, he added. Discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients is still rife throughout Viet Nam, even providing obstacles for patients seeking treatment. The 2013 National Action Month for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, launched on November 10, will focus on reducing the risk of infection by organising conferences and seminars to raise awareness.

Dam made the call at a session of the National Committee for Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS, Drugs and Prevention, held in Ha Noi yesterday to review the efforts from the first half of the year and to set tasks for the remainder of 2014. The Deputy PM, who is also the chair of the committee, said the task of providing education and communicating methods to prevent and control the disease would be difficult given State budget allocations and official development assistance (ODA) had been falling since the beginning of the year. Dam called on officials to mobilise all available resources to fight contributing factors linked to the spread of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS and the risks posed by drugs and prostitution needed to be included in workshops at high schools, said Dam, adding that students were one of the groups most vulnerable to the disease. The Deputy PM also urged the Ministry of Public Security to collaborate with agencies and organisations in compiling statistics on the number of drug addicts nationwide. Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has also been asked to consider new medicines, besides Methadone, that could be used to rehabilitate drug users. Dam also requested localities to urgently map out financial options for revamping rehabilitation programmes by 2020. According to a report released by the committee, since the beginning of the year, the country has recorded 3,133 HIV-infected cases, 1,388 AIDS cases and 462 deaths from the disease. The virus is spreading in major cities like Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, especially among high-risk groups, such as male prostitutes and drug addicts. Drug crimes and prostitution have continued to escalate and it is estimated that there are more than 25,680 prostitutes in the country, mainly concentrated in the Red River Delta, the northern central and southeastern regions, and the Mekong Delta. As many as 478 models to prevent prostitution and support former sex workers to reintegrate into the community have been piloted in 40 provinces and cities. Competent agencies have also detected many transnational drug rings linked to large volumes of narcotics.

Transferring them to provincial- and regional-level hospitals would ensure they can use their health insurance since some local clinics do not have tie-ups with the social insurance agency. But Háº£i said it could make some of them give up treatment because of the need to travel long distances or complex about their situation. The province has set its sights on the UN 90-90-90 goals: 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and 90 per cent of people receiving ARV will achieve viral suppression by 2020. Now 68 per cent of people with HIV in the province know their HIV status, 46.5 per cent of them receive sustained ARV therapy, and 93 per cent of those receiving ARV have achieved viral suppression. Háº£i said USAID could provide assistance in achieving these goals soon. According to a USAID representative, a programme for this purpose will start in the province next September and go on until 2030. The province will get assistance in accessing, testing and treating HIV and accessing health insurance. USAID will also train health staff in identifying new HIV patients and people living with HIV without knowing it. These people will be counselled on testing and treating for viral suppression to prevent the spread in the community.

At a nation-wide conference on HIV/AIDS, drug and prostitution control yesterday, Tien said that last year the country had more than 14,100 people living with HIV, a fall of 26 per cent compared with 2011. More than 2,100 people died for AIDS last year which is half of the figure in 2011. ""However, the results are not sustainable and HIV/AIDS infection still faces a high risk of spreading further if we do not have effective control measures,"" said Tien. The number of people infected with HIV via sexual intercourse has increased compared with the those infected via blood contact, and it is forecast that unprotected sexual contact will be the main means of HIV transmission in coming years. ""But controlling transmission via sexual intercourse is much more difficult than with transmission via blood contact, as approaching and supervising prostitutes and men who have sex with men faces a lot of obstacles,"" she said. Nearly 46 per cent of people living with HIV were infected with the virus via sexual intercourse last year whereas only 42 per cent were infected via heroin injections. The rate in 2011 was 41.8 and 46.4 per cent respectively. Besides, provinces with new outbreaks of infection, including Binh Duong, Vinh Phuc and Ha Nam, so far have not invested much in carrying out control measures. Moreover, in the provinces bordering the metropolises Ha Noi and HCM City faces a greater risk of transmission, said Tien. In the meantime, foreign financial support, which makes up 70 per cent of the total funds for epidemic control, is expected to decrease sharply by 2015 as Viet Nam becomes a middle-income nation. ""It is a big difficulty for the country as the number of people living with HIV is still high with 4,000-5,000 new cases per year,"" said Tien. It is forecast that the country will have about 300,000 people living with HIV by 2015, and 140,000 of them will need antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment during their whole life. ""Thus if funds for control is not enough, the country will not reach expected targets and thus faces a high risk of transmission to the community,"" said Tien. The Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the organisation that offers the biggest fund for HIV/AIDS control, plans to cut its financial support by US$10 million a year. PEPFAR supported the control with more than $82 million in 2011, but by 2015 the fund will be only $40 million. To mobilise funds for HIV control, Deputy Minister of Finance Nguyen Thi Minh proposed to diversify organisations and individuals joining the programme. Under the proposed project, enterprises and organisations supplying HIV/AIDS prevention and control services will enjoy preferential tax policies. The Law on Health Insurance will be amended so people living with HIV and drug addicts will benefit from the fund. The fund can pay 20 per cent of the total treatment expenses, thus people living with HIV should be encouraged to buy the insurance, said Minh. Speaking at the conference, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the HIV/AIDS control steering committee at different levels to research and complete the law system on HIV/AIDS prevention and control, and strengthen information output on the subject to the whole people, especially the youth, about the disease and how to avoid it. International co-operation should be improved and different sponsor sources should be mobilised and used effectively, he said.

Fourteen provinces and cities, including Lam Dong, Dak Lak, Binh Phuoc and Ca Mau, have not introduced treatment with methadone. Long said the reason was that the provinces and cities had not paid enough attention to the treatment programme; they had not assigned workers or the equipment needed to conduct it, and the administrative procedures to receive patients were complicated. The opening of new health centres providing treatment with methadone had met with obstacles due to a lack of workers and the difficult terrain in remote areas.

Nguyá»…n Há»¯u HÆ°ng, deputy director of the cityâ€™s Department of Health, was quoted by Tuá»•i Tráº» (Youth) newspaper as saying that the city had been selected by the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) as one of five pilot cities to reach the target by 2030. The UN Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has chosen the city as one of the largest fast-track cities in the world achieving its 90-90-90 targets set by the UN in 2014. The 90-90-90 goals mean that by 2020 90 per cent of HIV-infected people will know their infection status, 90 per cent of HIV positive people will receive anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs, and 90 per cent of people taking ARV drugs will have a low HIV load. HCM City is expected to reach its 90-90-90 target ahead of schedule, having achieved a 73-75-96 target so far. In recent years, international support for AIDS/HIV has been declining, so the city has tried to ensure that there will be no interruptions in HIV/AIDS prevention by issuing new policies to maintain ARV for an HIV patientâ€™s entire life and to limit drug resistance and spread of the disease. The city continues to provide HIV treatment for patients, including paying 100 per cent for health insurance cards and 20 per cent co-payment for ARV drugs for people living with HIV in the city, including those with temporary residence certificates of six months. Methadone treatment for patients addicted to drugs is also paid by the city. According to the Viá»‡t Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control under the health ministry, the city has 31,877 people living with HIV/AIDS receiving ARV treatment. This figure represents more than 25 per cent of the estimated total figure of people living with HIV in the country Dr HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh, deputy director of the Viá»‡t Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control warned that AIDS could spread among people not yet diagnosed for HIV. The estimated number could be about 50,000 people, especially among five groups: transgender people, gay men, users of drug injections, people working away from home, and prostitutes. ""Viá»‡t Nam is adopting the latest international models of HIV prevention, but it is necessary to have new peers to prevent spread to these five groups,â€� he said. With ARV drugs and other efforts, many experts say that people living with HIV can live for 50 years from the date of infection, he said. The first person diagnosed with HIV in the country in 1992 is alive and well. This year, health insurance began covering the costs of treating opportunistic infections.

Eight years ago, AIDS was rare in the commune. Now Vinh Xuan has the highest number of HIV-positive people in the central provinces and is struggling to meet the serious challenge that the disease poses.

Over the past several years, one or two AIDS victims have died each year.

Local authorities are having trouble fighting the spread of AIDS as many of those with the disease refuse to go to hospital for treatment or report their condition to authorities. In addition to poor public knowledge about HIV/AIDS, health officials are facing a daunting task. There have been many deaths due to local peopleâ€™s lack of knowledge on the dangers of unprotected sex and AIDS.

""I felt like I was literally falling into hell. I am an adult and at least I had the chance to taste the joys of life but my baby is innocent. Her life was stolen from her because of somebody elseâ€™s fault."" said Khuyen. Khuyen did not know that she had been infected and had contracted the disease from her husband, who subsequently died three months after discovering he had the virus. Due to ignorance of the disease, the young mother and her baby were forced to move from their small house and live separately from her husbandâ€™s family. ""All of them love us dearly, but they were too scared to open their arms to us as they didnâ€™t have any idea about the disease, all they knew was that it is an epidemic that causes death. The only thing that helped me get over the hardest time of my life was the love I have for my child and my belief in God."" said Khuyen. Everyday the young widow would go to church to pray in the hope that her child would return a negative result on her tests after 18 months. However, this was not to be as the resulting tests returned positive, coupled with her dire financial situation, Khuyen had become an emotional and physical wreck. It was during this time that she was introduced to the Camellia Club, by a friend from church. The club is a Ford Foundation funded joint-project between the Centre for Community Health and Development (COHED), a Vietnamese Non-Government Organisation and the Hai Phong Centre for Health Communication and Education (HCHCE), that aims to aid women who have contracted HIV/AIDS through their husbands. Key members of the club are equipped with a wide range of knowledge about the disease and care giving methods for taking care for HIV/AIDS victims. They endeavour to enable sufferers to access the free health services of the National HIV/AIDS Programme while providing their time to care for patients. ""Not every family welcomes us when we come to help. Some families have even released their dogs on us. Receiving us in their home is admitting that one of their family members has now got the virus,"" said Le Thi Than, another member of the club. Through the mass media and public education programmes, public discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients has become much improved over the last few years. The situation, however, is still a major problem in rural and remote areas as the local population often has a rudimentary grasp of the disease and discrimination is often rife. ""Life used to be hard for me and I donâ€™t want others to get into a similar situation. What I have done to help the group is not that special, but it really makes my life more personally meaningful for the short time that I am here,"" said Than. Than said that she was crushed by the unwanted stares of her co-workers at the office when they discovered she was HIV/AIDS positive. Though her colleagues were not direct in their united desire that she leave, their actions sent a clear message that she was no longer welcome as a cook at the Hai Phong Ship building yards. Experts agree that her situation is very typical of what HIV/AIDS sufferers routinely endure in work environments around the country. Director of the HCHCE, Nguyen Quang Thinh, said ""Our mission now is to break through the prejudices of society about this disease and the people that live with it."" After more than a year in operation, the clubâ€™s members have approached and helped more than 200 people and given them access to much needed health services. The group has also steered away from only providing activities related to HIV/AIDS but are also active in the support of children whose parents have died from the virus.

Infants suffer without vital HIV/AIDS drugs,"Antire-trovirals are the drug cocktails that have extended the lives of people with HIV/AIDS across the world, but this crucial treatment is not available for Vietnamese children with the deadly disease.",[],2005-01-18,vietnamnews.vn,"Infants suffer without vital HIV/AIDS drugs (18-01-2005) Van Anh A six-month-old with HIV/AIDS receives a check-up in the Ha Tay-based centre of Education and Labour No 2. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Phung Trieu HA NOI â€” Antire-trovirals are the drug cocktails that have extended the lives of people with HIV/AIDS across the world, but this crucial treatment is not available for Vietnamese children with the deadly disease. While ARV drugs do not cure HIV nor prevent HIV transmission, when used in combination these medications reduce the amount of virus in the blood and help delay the progress of the disease. Children with HIV/AIDS desperately need ARV drugs to stay healthy as the number of infections starts to climb. Official health ministry statistics report children under 13 years with HIV/AIDS has risen slightly, from 0.3 per cent of infections in 1997 to 0.82 per cent last year. Although HIV/AIDS expert Duong Ba Truc says the real figures are much higher partly due to the social stigma of reporting the virus, lack of effective detection and testing facilities across all areas in country. Infected children, in particular newborns, are susceptible to opportunistic infections, which people with HIV/AIDS suffer due to their lower immunity levels. Nguyen Thi Phuong says all the 18 abandoned and orphaned children under her care at the Ha Tay Centre of Education and Labour No 2 in Ha Tay are chronically ill. ""They look sick with highly swollen bellies; some have conditions like pneumonia and diarrhoea,"" says Phuong, 48, the centreâ€™s director explained about the children, who range from toddlers to eight-year olds. The centre, about 40km from Ha Noi, hosted its first juvenile HIV case in early 2001. Phuong says the children have been sent from the capitalâ€™s major paediatrics and obstetrics hospitals. ""I was told children with HIV/AIDS could live for five or six years but some of them have lived for two yearsâ€™ more,"" says Phuong. ""If they are treated with ARV I strongly believe that their lives would be prolonged."" The director points out ARV drugs could also raise the quality of life for these children as they would be less prone to opportunistic infections. Three-year-old Giao has HIV and arrived at the centre shortly after his birth, now his stomach is often bloated and he suffers chronic diarrhoea. Six children have died of AIDS at the centre since 2002 says Phuong. Money troubles Dr Truc says the youngest HIV/AIDS patients in Viet Nam, who are mostly under the age of two, have not accessed ARV treatment. Truc, head of the Central Paediatrics Hospitalâ€™s haematology department, says they have medications to treat opportunistic infection diseases. ""Weâ€™ve never had ARV drugs for the children before,"" he says. A report from the World Health Organisation last year revealed treating children with antiretrovirals presents special challenges. Few HIV medicines are produced in paediatric formulations, and those available as syrups are less effective compared to prophylactics Truc says the hospital, with US$20,000 from the Global Fund, has just started buying ARV for child patients, but the costs are still prohibitive as some of the drugs have to be imported. ""I expect all children with HIV/AIDS will start free ARV treatment next month."" The doctor says even existing forms of HIV treatment are exceedingly expensive. A child needs about VND600,000 ($40) per month, which does not include the costs of medicines to fight persistant infections. At the moment the children at Phuongâ€™s centre receive only VND35,000 as a medication and clothing allowance each month. Deputy director of pharmaceutical maker Viet Nam STADA, Phan Huy, says his company does not manufacture any antiretroviral drugs for children as there is not a great commercial demand for them yet. ""Therefore if we produced them the retail prices would be extremely high,"" Huy explains. Tran Quoc Tuan, head of Dong Da Hospitalâ€™s Department for Infectious Diseases, recalled when frantic grandparents from Lang Son Province contacted him to find out about treatment for their only grandson. ""They called me at least seven times over 10 days intent on buying ARV for the eight-year-old,"" says Tuan. The boyâ€™s parents had died of AIDS and although he is still healthy, his family are very concerned. Tuan told to them to try the Central Paediatrics Hospital, but they came away devastated that there was no ARV for children.",Society,"['treatment', 'arv', 'opportunistic', 'suffer', 'ha', 'vital', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'paediatrics', 'centre', 'children', 'drugs', 'infants']","Infants suffer without vital HIV/AIDS drugs(18-01-2005)Van AnhA six-month-old with HIV/AIDS receives a check-up in the Ha Tay-based centre of Education and Labour No 2.

Loneliness and isolation Ban Thi Thanh Truc, a six-year-old girl in Bai Da Village of Luc Son Commune, Luc Nam District of Bac Giang Province, has lived a solitary life since she was only four years old. She carries the virus within her. Trucâ€™s parents were both infected by the HIV/AIDS virus and died when she was just a small child. Truc now lives with her uncleâ€™s family, though they all consider her a burden. The family leaves her to a small separate corner in the house, and she eats alone, with separate bowls and chopsticks. Ever since she was four years old, Truc has had to wash her own clothes and take care of herself. The family members donâ€™t even come near her, much less make contact with her. Truc is only one of the unlucky children in the country infected with HIV/AIDS by their parents, living in the harsh glares and discriminating looks of people around them.

Ngoc and Huong were among 60 children nationwide participating in a national forum on childrenâ€™s voices on HIV/AIDS, which was co-organised last Saturday by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) in collaboration with Save the Children UK and World Vision. The forum created a chance for these children to raise their voices on HIV/AIDS-related issues as well as to deliver their messages about care, support and treatment for children infected/affected by HIV/AIDS to Government leaders. Other children attending the forum also told stories about the discrimination against them, including cases of doctors refusing to carry out health check-ups and principals asking students with HIV to leave school. According to the statistics provided by the Viet Nam Administration of AIDS Control under the Ministry of Health, at present the country has roughly 300,000 people living with HIV. By the end of May 2007, the relative number of children below 13 nationwide infected by the virus was 1,398. However, the number of children whose lives are affected by the epidemic is much higher. ""There are currently some 300,000 children affected by HIV/AIDS, meaning that they are either infected with the virus or have parents who have died or are living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Dam Huu Dac, Deputy Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs. Given the growth in the epidemic since these estimates were developed, the number of children living with and affected by the virus is likely to have grown substantially. A survey carried out by the former Viet Nam Committee for Population, Families and Children, in collaboration with Save the Children UK, studying 236 children living with HIV in Ha Noi, Hai Phong, HCM City, An Giang and Quang Ninh provinces revealed that the majority of these children perceive themselves to be living in dire economic circumstances. The relative economic status of children living with HIV/AIDS is particularly poor. Parents dead or leaving home, parentsâ€™ illnesses and a lack of employment were the top reasons behind this relative poverty. These children must also bear the stigma and discrimination from people living around them, which is the biggest obstacle in the countryâ€™s cause to support and provide help to them. Concerted efforts While working hard to reduce the number of children infected by HIV and AIDS, authorities and those in the health sector are putting much effort into caring for and supporting those infected and affected by the epidemic. A number of legal documents have been issued to deal with the problem, including orders, circulars, decrees and laws on protection, care and education of children. In 2004, the Law on Protection, Care and Education of Children, first issued in 1991, was amended, supplemented by the National Assembly, clearly specifying the rights of children and emphasising that HIV/AIDS-affected children should not be discriminated against. The hardships these children must face is recognised by authorities. ""Actually it is very hard to deal with this issue. While economic difficulties can be solved by calling for support from the Government and a variety of funding sources, the social stigma can only be reduced by humanity. People may say they are not scared of people having HIV/AIDS, but in fact they are,"" said Nguyen Trong An, vice director of the Department for Childrenâ€™s Issues of MOLISA. ""In order to reduce the stigma and discrimination against these children, communication should be strengthened in order to help the community improve their understanding of HIV,"" said An. An added that discrimination cases would be dealt with in a strict manner if specific people were identified. However, the most important thing that would help is calling for people to become more sympathetic and understanding with these children, for they are as innocent and as normal as everyone else and they deserve every right that a child should have, including the rights to all medical treatments, to be protected and to go to school, said Jeremy Stoner, country director of Save the Children UK. ""Child care and child protection now is one of the Governmentâ€™s major concerns. Viet Nam has made efforts to harmonise its national laws and has had international conventions assisting children in difficult circumstances, including those infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. The forum shows commitment, determination and the increased efforts of the Government and international organisations to fight stigma and discrimination against children living with HIV/AIDS,"" said Deputy Minister of MOLISA Dam Huu Dac.",Society,"['social', 'lives', 'parents', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'hard', 'infected', 'discrimination', 'virus', 'stigma', 'children']","Hard lives of children with HIV(22-01-2008)Forum listens to the unheard voices of the epidemicâ€™s most innocent victimsInternational visitors present gifts to children living with HIV/AIDS at Dien Giac Pagoda in HCM City. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Duong NgocHA NOI â€” Children infected with HIV/AIDS or those whose parents have died or are living with the epidemic suffer hard lives and the ever-present spectre of death, social stigma and discrimination from those around them, making their lives a constant state of misery.

Employee shortage poses risk to HIV fight,"Authorities in Son La Province, a northern border province infamous for drug smuggling and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, decided to lay off all non-permanent medical workers at methadone centres in the area.",[],2015-12-25,vietnamnews.vn,"A medical staffer gives methadone to an HIV-positive man in northern mountainous Son La Provinces Moc Chau District. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc by Chi Lan SON LA (VNS) â€” Authorities in Son La Province, a northern border province infamous for drug smuggling and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, decided to lay off all non-permanent medical workers at methadone centres in the area. According to Decision 93 issued by the municipal Peoples Committee, medical staff who work at local methadone centres on a yearly contract will lose their jobs next Friday. It means that seven out of 10 employees of the Thuan Chau Districts methadone centre, which provides the treatment drug to about 124 local people with drug addictions every morning, will be out of work. The other three are permanent employees, including the centres director. Lo Thi Tinh, 23, a contract employee at the centre, said everyone thinks the work she does â€“ giving the patients the right dose of methadone - is easy and requires little effort. ""But in fact I have to work every day, even on the weekend with every morning spent with the patients while doing the paperwork - for example, the treatment report for the patients in the afternoon,"" Tinh said. She receives a monthly wage of VND2.139 million (US$95), with neither social insurance nor bonus for her work on weekends. Tinh said she struggles to raise her family of three on such a paltry sum of money, but added that she was still grateful for the position because it was difficult to find a job relevant to her pharmaceutical degree in the area. The reason behind the furlough was not clearly stated in the Decisions document, but Son La HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Dam Van Huong said that financial reasons likely triggered the decision to downsize. Luong Minh Tuan, director of the Thuan Chau Health Centre, said the job cuts are expected to create problems for the health system, which already has a shortage of employees. He said the three remaining staff would not be able to consult and provide treatment and follow-up health checks to the 100-plus patients who come to the methadone centre every day. ""So far we have no choice but to ask two employees from the two communal health stations to pick up the job here at the methadone centre,"" Tuan said. ""Those two will share their time between the heath station and the centre."" Permanent staff frozen The health stations affected by Decision 93 currently have five staff each to provide health services to a dozen thousand local people, and are already overloaded with their daily tasks. One of the two, Tong Lanh Communal Health Station, which also provided ARV (antiretroviral) drugs to 50 HIV-positive patients, was spread thin due to a shortage of health workers, said head of the station Bac Thi Thuan. ""Freezing the number of permanent employees is making our work really hard,"" she said. Keeping the number of permanent state employees stagnant, or going further by making additional staff cuts, has been a national priority policy in recent years. Both the Government and residents have repeatedly called for action regarding the issue. The Chieng Son communes health station is located about 25km south of the abandoned villa of notorious drug ringleader Giang A Tang, who smuggled drugs worth millions of dollars from Laos to Viet Nam via Son La. At the same time, the region struggles to help people facing drug addiction. The methadone centre, built next to the health station, expects to see staff cuts similar to Thuan Chau Districts, and staff are bracing themselves for their 10 employees to be reduced to just three at the beginning of January. Two workers of the station will be sent to the centre to help care for the 131 patients being treated with methadone, said health station head Tran Thi Van. ""But the hitch is that we are already strained with the current workload,"" she said. Her health station is supposed to cover health services for about 9,000 residents with only seven workers available. The lack of employees is posing a serious risk to the newly adopted pivot plan by the Government - the 90-90-90, said Son La HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre Director Dam Van Huong. The plan, first initiated by UNAIDS last year, aims to make 90 per cent of all people living with HIV aware of their HIV status. In addition, it aims for 90 per cent of all people diagnosed with HIV to receive sustained antiretroviral therapy. Son La, which has nearly 8,000 people facing drug addiction and 7,722 people with HIV, according to the provincial police, was chosen to be one of five pilot localities to carry out the plan that is due to reach the three targets in 2017. The other four are also hot spots of HIV infection, including Dien Bien, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An and HCM City. Huong warned that the current employee shortage, worsened by the latest downsize, is likely to make the fight against HIV ""a mess"" in just three months. Van, as a voice from the grassroots level of the health system, said that with the current number of employees, ""it is simply impossible"". â€” VNS",Society,"['methadone', 'patients', 'fight', 'employees', 'hiv', 'employee', 'station', 'la', 'centre', 'staff', 'son', 'risk', 'work', 'poses', 'shortage', 'health']","A medical staffer gives methadone to an HIV-positive man in northern mountainous Son La Province's Moc Chau District.

HIV/AIDS can't stand in the way of love,Journalist Nguyen Thanh Ngan shocked her family and friends a year ago when she announced her impending marriage to a man with HIV.,[],2007-03-26,vietnamnews.vn,"Talk Around Town (25-03-2007) by Binh Minh Journalist Nguyen Thanh Ngan shocked her family and friends a year ago when she announced her impending marriage to a man with HIV. Ngan, a woman who works at the Gia Dinh va Xa Hoi (Family and Society) newspaper, said her decision to spend the rest of her life with painter Nguyen Trong Kien was simple. ""I married Kien because I love his beautiful soul. He is not only my partner, but also my friend and my teacher in art and life,"" said Ngan. The toughest part was finding out how to prevent the virusâ€™s spread during intercourse and adapting to living with someone who will likely die of AIDS-related complications, she said. Her decision is not without its critics here in the city. In fact, many are sure HIV/AIDS automatically spells disaster in any relationship. ""I would never forgive my partner for getting the disease. HIV means you are promiscuous and donâ€™t have safe sex. I would not accept a future husband like that,"" said Ngo Thuy Linh, a third-year student at Ha Noiâ€™s University for Foreign Studies. Others believe the disease is just another challenge to overcome. ""I havenâ€™t had a boyfriend yet, but if I knew my husband-to-be was HIV positive, I think I would stay beside him because he would need my support,"" said Mai Thu Trang, a young writer. ""I would not leave him because that would only cause more misery."" Trang said how her boyfriend contracted the disease would affect her decision. Nguyen Thi Hong Minh, director of the Central Reproduction Healthcare Centre, said she used to be suprised by the number of people wanting information about loving someone with HIV/AIDS. Many youth ask me how to get their partners tested for AIDS or whether they should marry someone who is HIV-postive, said Minh. The doctor once received a letter from a girl in HCM City who said she would do anything for her lover, even if it meant contracting the disease herself. She wrote: ""Because I love my partner deeply, I accept that I will eventually die of AIDS too."" The girl has a negative outlook, said Mai Thu Thuy, a sexual heath advisor. People should feel free to marry someone who is HIV positive, but no one should just ""accept death"", said Thuy. ""She should visit a doctor and learn the necessary tools to protect herself and her partner. Then she can decide what she wants to do,"" she said. For many couples dealing with HIV/AIDS, itâ€™s the parents who object the most. ""I would never allow my daughter to marry a man with HIV. I would try to make her see how her life would be destroyed,"" said Nguyen Thi Nhung, a 54-year-old father. ""I nearly fainted when my daughter told me her boyfriend is HIV positive. I couldnâ€™t discourage her, and now that theyâ€™re married, I feel sorry for her and for my family,"" said a mother who wished to remain anonymous. A woman from the capitalâ€™s Dong Da District told her story about living with her HIV positive husband on a sexual heath education website for teens under the guise of Nickname Chips. ""Hearing the bad news I was so shocked and angry, but then I found out how to keep myself from getting infected. Talking with health professionals helped me decide what to do. Weâ€™ve been married for nearly three years, and Iâ€™ve never regreted my choice,"" she wrote. But the woman was quick to add a warning of her own: ""Living with an HIV patient is not easy at all and you should think carefully before making any decision. Taking advice from parents and friends is something you should consider, but itâ€™s your love and courage that must be taken into account."" Itâ€™s clear, despite medical advancements, there is a possibility couples can infect each other without meaning to. Giving birth to a healthy child, a goal of many in society, can also be a difficult prospect. No less daunting is the social stigma people who carry the virus are subject to everyday. If your love is strong enough, then the decision to stay by the side of a partner with HIV depends on your courage to face this new challenge. If you cannot accept this as part of your relationship, then perhaps you should support your loved one as a friend instead. But be sure to get as much information as possible to dispel myths or rumours about HIV/AIDS before you decide either way. ""AIDS can hinder love, there is no doubt of that. However, we want people who are going out with someone who is HIV positive to know AIDS does not mean you wonâ€™t live a long and happy life together,"" said Minh. â€” VNS",Talk Around Town,"['partner', 'love', 'stand', 'cant', 'woman', 'nguyen', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'way', 'life', 'decision', 'accept', 'positive']","""I havenâ€™t had a boyfriend yet, but if I knew my husband-to-be was HIV positive, I think I would stay beside him because he would need my support,"" said Mai Thu Trang, a young writer.

For this old woman crying had always helped her overcome the struggle of being a mother of two boys infected with HIV/AIDS. Linh, who lives in Ha Long City in north-eastern Quang Ninh Province, said hard times fell on her family when her husband, who had been exposed to Agent Orange, died in 1986. His passing left Linh alone with her three children, aged from 5 to 16 years of age. Linh said she had little time to look after her children because she had to earn money to feed them. ""As time went by my children got involved with some social evils, especially illegal drugs,"" said Linh. ""I didnâ€™t know my two sons had become drug addicts until it was discovered that they had contracted AIDS. ""My familyâ€™s income declined when my first son grew more seriously ill, we didnâ€™t have enough to make two meals per day. ""I tried to borrow some money from my friends to feed my son rice soup until he died. At that time he was 25 years old."" After Linhâ€™s son died, she had to look after her sonâ€™s wife who had no job and their two children. Desperate for help, Linh was given a lifeline in the form of assistance from the cityâ€™s Empathy Club for the Elderly. Elderly express emotion in poetry Elderly carers of HIV/AIDS victims who wrote poems inspired by their ordeals received awards from the Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union on Thursday. The awards were the result of a poetry competition, part of a project run by HelpAge International that attracted more than 2,000 elderly people from Quang Ninh, Ha Noi, Thai Nguyen and Nam Dinh. The contest aimed to spotlight the impacts of HIV/AIDS on the elderly and raise awareness on the elderly peopleâ€™s role and contribution in caring for and supporting people living with HIV/AIDS. Nguyen Khac Toi from Thai Nguyen Province won the first prize with his poem Long Ba (The Heart of Grandmother). There were two second prizes, three third prizes and 13 encouragement prizes. A loan from the club has allowed Linh to start her own business. She opened a tea shop while her daughter-in-law earned some money cleaning bicycles and motorbikes. Linh said her familyâ€™s living standards had improved but her two grandchildren were suffering heart problems and serious diseases including arthrosis. The children are always ill when the weather changes. ""The loan is just a little but it is a great encouragement for my family,"" said Linh. Linh is one of many older people who have to take responsibility for family members living with HIV/AIDS in the country. According to a recent survey by the Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Unionâ€™s research arm, about 74.2 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS who responded to the survey were being taken care of by their parents or grandparents, 68 per cent of them were being cared for by their mothers and grandmothers. Findings from another survey conducted by the Viet Nam Association of the Elderlyâ€™s research arm among elderly people who had a HIV/AIDS victim in the family found that 82.6 per cent of these elderly people had to care for an average of between one to three family members. These old-aged carers have little support in the community, and desperately need help to soften the mental and physical sufferings for their own adult children and their orphaned grandchildren. Call for support Health workers in the field have called on more support and encouragement for elderly carers of AIDS victims through schemes such as HIV/AIDS prevention programmes. Pham Hoai Giang, an official at the Viet Namâ€™s Women Union, says the fierce fight against HIV/AIDS had affirmed the important role and great contribution of older people in caring for HIV-positive people and their children as well as in work on AIDS prevention. Giang said older people were taking part actively but silently in this fight and faced uncountable challenges and great responsibilities. ""How painful it is for them to have to witness their beloved children dying of AIDS and their grandchildren, because of AIDS, having to deal with stigma and discrimination from their relatives and the wider community,"" said Giang. ""We need to support and encourage them to participate further and more effectively in their work."" The Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union carried out a project to minimise the impacts of HIV/AIDS in the country with support from overseas non-government organisation HelpAge International (HAI). Under the project, carried out from 2005 to 2009, 67 empathy clubs for the elderly with nearly 3,300 member have been established in Ha Noi, Thai Nguyen, Nam Dinh and Quang Ninh. The clubs have focused activities on loans to raise incomes, healthcare for the elderly and spreading useful information on HIV/AIDS in the community. The project also provided support for people with AIDS, children orphaned due to AIDS and people in high-risk groups. Nguyen Thi Hoa Binh, director of a centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Healthcare, said it is necessary to create conditions for the elderly to take part in communication activities on HIV/AIDS and Government and NGO programmes.",Society,"['project', 'care', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'family', 'aids', 'workers', 'help', 'quang', 'victims', 'support', 'children', 'elderly']","HIV/AIDS victimsâ€™ care workers call for help(13-08-2007)by Thu GiangThe mother of an HIV/AIDS victim speaks at a meeting of the Empathy Club for the Elderly in Cam Thach Ward of Cam Pha Town in Quang Ninh Province.

Viet Nam set an ambitious treatment target to help end the AIDS epidemic, named 90-90-90 targets that by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. ""Since 1990, there have been 230,000 people infected with HIV and 85,000 have died of AIDS in Viet Nam. The country was aware of the threat of deadly epidemic,"" Deputy PM Dam said at the conference. ""With the effective help from international organisations, nations and the efforts of Vietnamese government offices, social organisations and the whole community including HIV-infected persons, Viet Nam has prevented and pushed back step-by-step this epidemic."" Viet Nam has implemented many models comprising the prevention and support of a variety of drugs to control the virus. Viet Nam has reported a reduction of the number of HIV-infected persons, people having HIV became AIDS, and died of AIDS for the last eight years. ""Todays conference is a practical activity of Viet Nam in response to the new HIV treatment targets and the national action month of HIV/AIDS prevention {November 10 to December 10],"" the Deputy PM said. Measures involved in prevention and treatment support needed the participation of scientists and the whole societys help. In Viet Nam, there are hundreds of scientific studies and proposals related to people living with HIV and treatment every year. However, the deputy PM said, to take advantage of the effectiveness of scientific studies, the government had to promulgate policies to support the implementation of these studies. The whole society also had to share in the responsibility to speed up the implementation. The conference attracted 1,000 international and Vietnamese participants with 180 reports expected to be presented. Francoise Barre Sinoussi, a French virologist and director of the Regulation of Retroviral Infections Division in Paris, France, attended the event. In 2008, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with her former mentor, Luc Montagnier, for their discovery of HIV. â€” VNS",Society,"['deputy', 'fight', 'urges', 'conference', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'society', 'prevention', 'effort', 'epidemic', 'treatment', 'organisations']","Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam called for efforts from the whole society, government offices and organisations to eliminate the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030.

HIV patientâ€™s heart surgery successfully conducted,Doctors from the Viá»‡t Nam-Germany Hospital have successfully conducted an eight-hour heart surgery on a female patient with the HIV virus.,[],2017-05-19,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” Doctors from the Viá»‡t Nam-Germany Hospital have successfully conducted an eight-hour heart surgery on a female patient with the HIV virus. Associate Professor Nguyá»…n Há»¯u Æ¯á»›c, head of the hospitalâ€™s Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Department, said the 42-year-old patient was hospitalised on May 4. The woman was infected with the HIV virus in 2005 and began using antiretroviral drugs in 2015, he added. Doctors also diagnosed that she suffered from type-A aortic aneurysm, aortic insufficiency, mitral incompetence and Marfan syndrome. Æ¯á»›c said Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the bodyâ€™s connective tissue, with 0.5 per cent of the population suffering from this disease. Patients with Marfan syndrome showed pathological symptoms related to the eyes and the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems. Cardiovascular damage is generally associated with aortic aneurysms and mitral incompetence, he said. Type-A aortic aneurysm is serious life-threatening disease, with 3-4 patients per 100,000 people contracting the disease every year, he said. If not provided proper treatment, only some 10 per cent of patients with the disease can live more than one year, he said. The surgery was conducted on May 9 by Æ¯á»›c and PhÃ¹ng Duy Há»“ng SÆ¡n from the Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Department and eight other doctors. The heart surgery was believed to be complicated because the patientâ€™s immune system was depleted due to the HIV infection, he said.

Can you update our readers on the HIV/AIDS situation in Viá»‡t Nam in 2017? In the first nine months of 2017, more than 6,880 people tested positive for HIV, of which over 3,480 have turned AIDS. We recorded 1,260 deaths of people with HIV. It is estimated by late this year, the number of new cases of people living with HIV will be about 9,800 while the number of deaths will climb to some 1, 900. According to the latest report on people living with HIV in 2017, 22 per cent of patients are women, while 78 per cent are men. The transmission route for 58 per cent of patients is sexual activity. Blood transfusions account for 32 per cent and mother-to-child transmission for 2.6 per cent. The route for 8 per cent of patients is undetermined. Regarding the age group distribution, some 40 per cent of the HIV positive people detected in 2017 are between 30-39, 30 per cent are in the age group of 20-29, 19 per cent in the age group of 40-49, 6 per cent are over 50, 3 per cent are from 14 to 19 and 2 per cent are children under 13 years old. The demographic characteristics of people living with HIV/AIDS in 2017 is almost the same as in 2016. In the first nine months of 2017, the number of new HIV cases fell 1.1 per cent compared to the same period in 2016. Meanwhile the number of new AIDS patients was also reduced by 39 per cent and the fatality rate among people with HIV/AIDS dropped by 10 per cent. In some provinces, over 10 per cent of pregnant women were HIV positive. This is due to the lack of early HIV/AIDS detection services for people, especially women who might become pregnant. Another point I want to mention here is the increasing transmission of HIV through unsafe sex, particularly among young people. Will you please further explain the significance of early HIV testing? As we all know the HIV virus can exist in the human body with few or no symptoms for 12 to 13 years, so people with HIV still live a normal life. Their HIV status is only revealed if they have a blood test. In our country up to 20 per cent of people living with HIV do not know that they are HIV positive as they donâ€™t go to health clinics for blood tests. If they know that they are HIV positive, they can take preventive measures to protect their sex partners, family members and other people. At present, we do not have any drug that can cure HIV, but anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs are available to help people with HIV prolong their healthy life while reducing the possibility of transmission to other people. People living with HIV should take ARV as described by their doctors. The latest scientific research has confirmed that if an HIV patient takes ARVs regularly, the chance of HIV transmission to their sex partner will drop by 96 per cent. Early detection of their HIV status will help the infected people enjoy good treatment and take action to reduce the risk of secondary infection. As a result, they can save quite a lot of money theyâ€™d have to spend on drugs, check-ups and hospital visits. Will you please further explain Viá»‡t Namâ€™s targets of 90-90-90 by 2020? The targets 90-90-90, set in 2014, mean that by 2020 90 per cent of HIV infected people will know their infection status, 90 per cent of HIV positive people will receive ARV drugs and 90 per cent of people taking ARV drugs will have a low HIV load. According to a September 2017 report, there are 208,371 people who know they are living with HIV/AIDS in Viá»‡t Nam. This figure represents about 75 per cent of the estimated total figure of people living with HIV in the community. So we will have to do quite a lot of work to achieve the target that 90 per cent of HIV infected people know their infection status. Currently, we have 1,345 health clinics providing services of counseling and testing for HIV positive people. 128 HIV labs in 63 provinces and cities are authorised to confirm HIV status for their clients, plus 1,250 laboratories are able to screen HIV tests in all district hospitals nation-wide. In addition, the Ministry of Health has scaled up community-based HIV testing services, focusing on 15 cities and provinces with large numbers of HIV infections; and piloted HIV self-testing in which people can perform a test on a sample of their saliva at community-based institutions. We hope through such activities weâ€™ll be able to detect more people with HIV and give them proper treatment. â€” VNS",Opinion,"['detection', 'early', 'viá»‡t', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', '2017', 'status', 'transmission', 'cent', 'focuses', 'know', 'positive']","Their HIV status is only revealed if they have a blood test.

The seminar, hosted by the AIDS Committee of HCM City, aimed to expand the Orphan and Vulnerable Children (OVC) programme, which has been running in HCM City since 2005. The OVC programme cares for HIV-infected orphans, who range from babies to teenagers. It provides children with health care, food, education, emotional counseling, shelter and legal support. The city has 70,000 orphaned children, of which 2,500 carry HIV. About six hundred children are born to HIV-infected mothers every year, according to the AIDS Committee.

Giang added that while the city has helped to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on children, co-operation between government agencies and NGOs should be improved. Currently, the city has only 11 centres applying the OVC programme, treating 4,212 orphans. The programme has received support from international and local organisations. However, according to the AIDS Committee, many needs remain unmet because there are too few centres providing care for infected orphans.

Speaking at a forum on MSM (men who have sex with men) and transgendered people about the UN targets on Monday, TiÃªu Thá»‹ Thu VÃ¢n, said that Viá»‡t Nam was one of the first 30 countries to try to achieve the targets by 2020. The 90-90-90 goals ensure that at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV will know their status, and that 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. In addition, 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy will be diagnosed with viral suppression. HCM City was chosen as one of 32 cities worldwide to reach the targets by 2020, VÃ¢n said. In the context of decreased international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention in the country, including in HCM City, the city is setting up a new treatment and management system to maintain positive results in prevention and achieve the targets. The committee estimates that, according to the targets, the city will have 14,038 more people with HIV that need treatment by 2020. Currently, the cityâ€™s hospitals and districtâ€™s preventive health centres are treating 27,500 people with HIV, she said. Last year, the city had an estimated 41,841 people with HIV. In the past, when international aid was provided, any patient with HIV who lived in the city, even those without an official residential book, was eligible to receive antiretroviral therapy. However, the provision of therapy would no longer be the same when international aid was cut completely, VÃ¢n said, adding that it must be provided through health insurance. VÃ¢n said the Viá»‡t Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS(VNP+) could help patients with HIV in the network better understand the issue. The networkâ€™s members can speak with health officials and encourage more people at a high risk of HIV to access testing services. The network can also help its patients with HIV maintain treatment, as some of them give up treatment when they encounter obstacles.

The ""USAID Community HIV Link - Northern Coast"" project will be carried out in the provinces of Nghe An and Quang Ninh as well as the port city of Hai Phong. The main implementer of the three-year project that closes in July 2017 will be the Centre for Community Health and Development (COHED). A press-release from the project sponsor, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), says that ""to contain current prevention and treatment activities, local civil society organisations (CSOs) and community-based organisations (CBOs) must increase their contributions to the national HIV programme."" As such, it will mobilise and train a network of CBSs to reach out to at-risk populations and facilitate the latters access to services like HIV testing and ARV treatment. The project identifies key populations into four categories: those who have not been HIV tested for the last six months or do not report their HIV status; those who inject drugs and have not had a HIV test during the last six months; those who have never enrolled in an out-patient clinic for ARV treatment or enrolled but dropped out or not properly followed the treatment protocol; and primary sexual partners of the first two categories. To build the capacity of CSOs and CBOs, the project will conduct capacity assessments, provide training and mentoring, and advocate provinces to involve the organisations in the process of formulating and issuing relevant policies for the localities. The project will also support CSOs and CBOs in joining the existing national network by participating in events, meetings and other activities. Dao Thi Mai Hoa, director of COHED, said that the project aims to help CBOs and CSOs reach about 6,700 at-risk people and refer over 6,000 to HIV Testing and Counseling. It aims to find over 600 new HIV cases and provide care and support services to more than 900 people living with HIV outside of the health facility.

Calls range from men who may have drunk too much and had sex without a contraceptive to a woman who stepped on a discarded syringe in Ngo Si Lien St while out for a morning walk Stories like these are common and it is the job of the hotline workers to provide immediate and informative answers to such calls. Nguyen Huy Thang is one such worker on the 10-member technical team from Ha Thanh Ltd.Co. ""The spread of HIV/AIDS is occurring so rapidly that it is not only high-risk groups who should be concerned,"" exclaimed Thang. ""We are advisors. Our job is to provide all types of information on HIV/AIDS for the callers."" World Bank grant for prevention HA NOI â€” Yesterday the World Bank approved a grant of US$35 million to support the HIV/AIDS Prevention Project for Viet Nam which aims to curb the transmission of HIV/AIDS. The number of Vietnamese people infected with HIV/AIDS is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The Ministry of Health estimated that 245,000 people were living with HIV by the end of 2003. However infection among high risk groups, mainly intravenous drug users and sex workers, is increasing. In response, the Government has prioritised prevention programmes targeting high risk groups, and aims to keep the disease below 0.3 per cent of the population. Director of the World Bank in Viet Nam Klaus Roland said the strategy also aims to increase awareness and change the attitude of the general populace and policy makers. ""Discrimination is hindering strategies to halt the transmission of HIV and we will support the Governmentâ€™s efforts create behavioural changes through education to reduce the stigma of the disease,"" he said. The grant supports the development of models to help reduce transmission of HIV/AIDS and will also support the governmentâ€™s efforts to develop a system to monitor the effectiveness of its prevention programme. More than 60 per cent of the World Bank grant will be used to support the design and implementation of specific provincial action plans among 18 provinces. â€” VNS ""We obtain this information from various sources including newspapers, health centres and experienced doctors from central hospitals in Ha Noi."" The hotline is currently working with two Ha Noi-based health centres, the Research Centre for Community Health and Development, and the Voluntary Advisory Centre. Information, facts and figures are also updated each week to ensure that callers are provided with the latest material and advice on HIV/AIDS. As of March 29, the hotline had received a total of 3,141 calls, of which 1,736 came from Ha Noi. On average, the service receives close to 50 calls per day. ""Most of the calls are about symptoms, infection, preventative methods, antiretroviral and other concerns of HIV-affected people,"" Thang said. The hotline is very optimistic about the potential of the project, mainly because of the privacy offered to callers and the timely advice provided. ""This is a psychological issue,"" said Thang. ""One of the characteristics of the Eastern people is that they seem to keep the disease secret."" After operating for one month, the project organisers expect the use of the hotline to increase. They also expect enquiries from HCM City to grow from the current 176 callers. With over 10-years of experience in HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, Doctor Nguyen Van Thanh, from the Ha Noi-based Research Centre for Community Health and Development, felt that the hotline had a great deal of potential. ""Thanks to the current trend in high-tech information technology, this is a creative project that is serving social development,"" said Thanh. The project was among 51 different activities that eventuated from Innovation Day, a conference held to promote the fight against HIV/AIDS across the country. The event, organised by the World Bank in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, was held in Ha Noi in May of last year. The hotline, costing US$10,000 to implement, was recognised and awarded at the event by the United States Agency for International Development.",Society,"['information', 'project', 'ha', 'noi', 'set', 'hivaids', 'bank', 'prevention', 'capital', 'development', 'health', 'hotline']","HIV/AIDS hotline set up in capitalHA NOI â€” Vietnamese people concerned about HIV/AIDS have the chance to receive information via a new hotline that kicked off earlier this month in the capital.

Oral HIV pre-exposure service launched,The Viá»‡t Nam Administration for AIDS Control in coordination with PATH has launched an oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service in Viá»‡t Nam.,[],2017-06-14,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITYâ€” The Viá»‡t Nam Administration for AIDS Control in coordination with PATH has launched an oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service in Viá»‡t Nam. Under the PrEP service which was launched on Monday, people who are at substantial risk of contracting HIV take an antiretroviral drug which contains tenofovir every day as part of a combination HIV-prevention strategy. When people are exposed to HIV through sex or recreational drug injections, the oral HIV PrEP may work to keep them from becoming infected. PrEP taken on a consistent basis has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92 per cent. Since 2015, the World Health Organisation has strongly recommended PrEP as part of a combination HIV-prevention strategy for people at substantial risk of contracting HIV. â€œPrEP is a new and evidenced-based method for HIV prevention that is increasingly being adopted around the world, including in lower- and middle-income countries,â€� said Dr. Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, director of Viá»‡t Nam Administration for AIDS Control. â€œBy introducing PrEP services in Viá»‡t Nam, we have the opportunity to dramatically reduce the number of new HIV cases and eliminate HIV in Viá»‡t Nam by 2030,â€� Long said. â€œOnce again, we see Viá»‡t Nam leading the region in HIV innovations and making key HIV services available to those who need them the most,â€� Mary Tarnowka, US Consul General, said. â€œWe greatly value our longstanding Viá»‡t Nam-US partnership and are working together to propel Viá»‡t Nam towards the 90-90-90 (90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy; and 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression) goals by 2020,â€� she said. The introduction of PrEP services is part of the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the Healthy Markets project, a five-year initiative funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). â€œThe integration of PrEP into HIV services in Viá»‡t Nam will provide a huge boost to reduce new HIV cases among those most at risk,â€� said Dr. Kimberly Green, chief of party for Healthy Markets. â€œThe aim of this PrEP pilot is to model how services can best be targeted and offered in a sustainable way. Results will be used to inform national guidelines and future PrEP financing,â€� she said. PrEP prescriptions began in March. The pilot programme will run until September 2018 at which time the results will be documented and presented to the Ministry of Health for the following steps. â€”VNS",Society,"['prep', 'preexposure', 'services', 'viá»‡t', 'nam', 'oral', 'hiv', 'service', 'cent', 'antiretroviral', 'aids', 'risk', 'reduce', 'launched']","HCM CITYâ€” The Viá»‡t Nam Administration for AIDS Control in coordination with PATH has launched an oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) service in Viá»‡t Nam.

Wives at risk of HIV need more information,"Women at high risk of HIV/AIDS have not received adequate education to protect themselves from the virus, a conference on the subject heard yesterday.",[],2011-05-12,vietnamnews.vn,"100 women with HIV/AIDS receive loans The TYM Fund under the Viet Nam Womens Union on Tuesday signed an agreement with Family Health International to implement a project that will provide loans to women affected by HIV/AIDS. Under the sponsorship of the US Agency for International Development, the project will be piloted in Nghe An and Thai Nguyen provinces and Ha Noi. It is expected to provide loans to 100 women in order to do small business, open sewing shops, and raise cattle. HA NOI â€” Women at high risk of HIV/AIDS have not received adequate education to protect themselves from the virus, a conference on the subject heard yesterday. Senior capacity development manager Amy Sunseri of Pact, a non-governmental organisation in Viet Nam, said the number of women living with HIV/AIDS was getting closer to that of men while women had less knowledge of the disease than men. The Ministry of Healths Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control estimated there would be about 77,000 women in the country living with HIV/AIDS by 2012, an increase of 5 per cent compared to 2002. But in a ministry survey of 10,000 people aged 14-25 in 2009, only 63 per cent of women knew clearly about the virus and had the necessary skills to protect themselves, while the percentage of men was 69. The number among women living in rural areas was about 50 per cent. Leader of a 1000-member support group in Ha Noi Trinh Thuy Ngan said most got the virus from their husband and took little care of the disease before joining the group. ""They neglected to protect themselves from transmission, thinking it was the others duty. Most lack deep understanding or skills on how to take care of themselves, how to get proper treatment and how to bring up their kids safely,"" Ngan said. UNAIDS Partnership adviser Chris Fontaine said an assessment of 24 HIV/AIDS programmes implemented by international and local NGOs showed that most focused on groups of injecting drug users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men and migrant workers. Women whose husbands had unsafe sex with prostitutes or were injecting drug users had yet to receive much attention, Fontaine said. Programmes and policies should focus more on intimate partner transmission and HIV/AIDS counsellors and reproductive health workers should be given training about the issues, Fontaine said. Representatives from international organisations suggested the best way to prevent intimate partner transmission was to promote 100 per cent condom use.",Society,"['information', 'men', 'international', 'need', 'women', 'noi', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'transmission', 'virus', 'risk', 'protect', 'wives', 'sex']","It is expected to provide loans to 100 women in order to do small business, open sewing shops, and raise cattle.

Online outreach scheme effective for men with HIV,"The use of the internet as a tool for early detection of HIV cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) has proven to be effective, particularly in light of budget cuts for HIV/AIDS prevention in HCM City.",[],2013-10-02,vietnamnews.vn,"The AIDS Committee of HCM City said the model was effective between July 2012 and June 2013. Roughly 5,500 MSM were accessed through the internet and more than 6,000 MSM were reached with traditional methods.â€” File Photo by Van Dat HCM CITY (VNS)â€” The use of the internet as a tool for early detection of HIV cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) has proven to be effective, particularly in light of budget cuts for HIV/AIDS prevention in HCM City. Satisfactory results were announced yesterday during a meeting to evaluate the projects with officials from the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), one year after the programme was piloted with eight peer educators knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and internet use. According to Nguyen Thi Hue, head of the Harm Reduction Department under the HCM City AIDS Committee, the project will be expanded to other provinces and cities. The city, which has widespread internet use, has more than 24,000 MSM aged between 15 and 49. Recent surveys show that using internet use to seek partners has become popular among the citys youth. The AIDS Committee of HCM City said the model was effective between July 2012 and June 2013. Roughly 5,500 MSM were accessed through the internet and more than 6,000 MSM were reached with traditional methods. However, in order to achieve good results, the committee needs 58 peer educators for traditional methods, while it needs only eight people for online access. The budget for traditional outreach last year was reported at more than VND3.2 billion while the budget for internet access was VND215 million. Le Son, group leader of MSMs online in HCM City, who has experienced as a group leader, said outreach through the internet had been a new experience for him. In the past, he would go online and chat with friends but he did not think of using internet to access clients. During the year of the pilot programme, Son said that he and his group faced many challenges but they were able to chat with five clients at the same time on the internet. Apart from computers, they also used smartphones to access people considered to be part of the highest at-risk population. The city had 450 peer educators for at-risk members of the MSM community, but the number has fallen to 100. In the future, there will be only MSM 70 peer educators who will receive salaries from the State budget, Hue said, adding that the number of online peer educators will be maintained at eight, Hue told Viet Nam News. Marta Ackers, associate director of the USs PEPFAR programme office in HCM City, said the project had been promising in HCM City, and neighbouring countries were also using this method. Community outreach is one of the most important elements of HIV prevention strategies targeting the people most at risk. Ackers recalled the situation in 1993 when HIV began to spread. HCM City implemented a harm-reduction programme, by piloting a needle-syringe programme for injection-drug users (IDUs) and condom use programme for and female sex workers (FSWs) through peer-outreach workers. The peer outreach worker network now is used in all of HCM Citys districts to serve the highest at-risk population, including IDUs and FSWs, by delivering free needle syringes and condoms. Now, while transmission is targeted on the MSM community, HIV prevention methods should be changed. Currently, only 3 per cent of the 20,000 to 25,000 most at-risk population of MSMs in HCM City have been reached via traditional outreach. HIV prevalence among MSMs in the city increased from 5.4 per cent in 2006 to 15 per cent in 2009, she said, adding that the project aimed to increase outreach and coverage of HIV service utility among MSMs. In a few years, the model will be expanded to other provinces and cities. The peer educators said they would do the job even without pay. Each MSM online peer educator receives VND500,000 each month. According to a social worker who works at the Mekong Deltas An Giang Provinces AIDS Prevention Centre, the province has only six MSM peer educators who can meet with their clients for consultations. According to the official, the rate of internet usage in the province is high and can be accessed in rural areas as well. The problem now is finding peer educators who are knowledgeable about HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. ""Discrimination is still high in the province, so not many gay people are ready to come out and become peer educators. It is more challenging there to seek online peer educators,"" he added. â€” VNS",Society,"['men', 'peer', 'msm', 'hcm', 'city', 'outreach', 'scheme', 'hiv', 'educators', 'online', 'internet', 'effective', 'programme', 'traditional']","The AIDS Committee of HCM City said the model was effective between July 2012 and June 2013.

HIV-AIDS patients to be covered by health insurance,"HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh, deputy director of the Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the newspaper Kinh táº¿&Ä�Ã´ thá»‹ (Economics and Urban Affairs) about the scheme to expand health insurance to cover HIV-AIDS patients.",[],2017-08-09,vietnamnews.vn,"HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh, deputy director of the Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the newspaper Kinh táº¿&Ä�Ã´ thá»‹ (Economics and Urban Affairs) about the scheme to expand health insurance to cover HIV-AIDS patients. Last year, Viá»‡t Nam set a goal to have all HIV carriers join the health care network. Do you know their current rate of coverage? Just about 50 per cent of HIV people have joined the national health insurance scheme. One of the reasons that many donâ€™t join is fear of being discriminated against or having a stigma against them. Some other HIV-infected people donâ€™t join because they donâ€™t have money to pay for their health insurance cards. Last but not least, many AIDS patients donâ€™t have the personal documents required for joining the health insurance scheme. As far as I know, many provincial committees have balanced their local budgets in order to provide this group with free health insurance cards. The Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control has decided to use funding from international organisations to buy health insurance cards for poor and needy HIV-AIDS patients. Are there any hurdles that HIV-AIDS centres have encountered in seeking coverage by the National Health Insurance Fund? By the end of May, some 79.6 percent of HIV treatment facilities affiliated with hospitals or healthcare centres had signed service agreements with the health insurance companies, and 44.4 percent of the health facilities nationwide had offered their services to HIV carriers with health insurance cards. In my opinion, the most challenging issue many health facilities are facing in HIV-AIDS treatment is that many of their staff do not have the required certificates. In addition, these health facilities are required to have permits to treat this group of people as a pre-requisite for financial settlement with the health insurance companies. The Ministry of Health will reportedly launch a pilot program using Buprenophine to replace Methadone to treat drug addicted HIV carriers. What are the differences between Buprenophine and Methadone? Buprenophine is safer than Methadone. Thatâ€™s the key reason the WHO has recommended Viá»‡t Nam switch. However, Buprenonphine is more expensive. Thatâ€™s why the Ministry of Health has introduced the use of Buprenophine for patients with sufficient financial resources. I want to further clarify that the Suboxone substance contained in Buprenophine has been piloted in HÃ  Ná»™i and Há»“ ChÃ­ Minh City and has yielded better results. So we plan to give Buprenophine to about 500 patients in the provinces of Ä�iá»‡n BiÃªn, Nghá»‡ An and SÆ¡n La in the remaining months of 2017 and by 2018 we will give the drug to another 2,000 patients in the previous three provinces, plus four more provinces _ Thanh HÃ³a, HÃ²a BÃ¬nh, YÃªn BÃ¡i and Lai ChÃ¢u._VNS",Society,"['required', 'covered', 'provinces', 'patients', 'dont', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'facilities', 'buprenophine', 'health', 'insurance']","HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nhHoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh, deputy director of the Department of HIV-AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the newspaper Kinh táº¿&Ä�Ã´ thá»‹ (Economics and Urban Affairs) about the scheme to expand health insurance to cover HIV-AIDS patients.

Attending the seminar were chairman of the CCSE Do Nguyen Phuong, UNDP representative in Ha Noi Jordan Ryan and representatives from Government offices, international and domestic organisations and NGOs. The seminar was organised to help the Party Central Committee issue a new instruction on HIV/AIDS prevention in the future, and aimed to find out the best ways of reducing stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam. Making a speech at the seminar, former chief of the National Committee for HIV/AIDS Prevention and editor-in-chief of AIDS and Community Magazine Chung A said Viet Nam had been aware of the heavy impact of stigma and discrimination towards people infected with, or affected by HIV/AIDS. ""It is why when developing a policy for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the country we pay attention to creating a legal basis appropriate to international practices and to values of our traditional culture to fight against stigma and discrimination,"" said A. A said many articles of the HIV/AIDS Ordinance passed by the NAâ€™s Standing Committee in 1995 shows the rights and interests of PLWHA. For example, Article 4 affirms that PLWHA should enjoy non-stigma and non-discrimination but have to take measures to prevent the transmission of the disease in order to protect the communityâ€™s health, while Article 18 prohibits the release of the name, age, address and image of a PLWHA to the public, except if an agreement is made by the person. Although the countryâ€™s policies and legislation regarding the fight against stigma and discrimination are rather comprehensive, they lack many important items such as issues relating to children and the rights of children infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. A said there is a lack of identification of social and individual responsibilities of those who are HIV positive as part of the programme to prevent the spread of HIV and their responsibilities within the community to remove the stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS. Carol Sherman, director of Care International in Viet Nam, said the country is faced with a rapidly growing epidemic.

""My teacher did not want me to play with classmates after she found that I was infected with HIV,"" Huyen recalls. ""My friends did not want to read the same book with me."" Huyen was so sad, she no longer wanted to go to school. Unfortunately, she is not alone in her suffering. Huyen is among many children infected with HIV/AIDS in the two provinces of Quang Ninh and An Giang where a survey was recently completed by children living with the disease. Quang Ninh and An Giang are two provinces in Viet Nam with the highest number of HIV/AIDS-infected children and adults. An official Nguyen Thi Anh Nguyet at the National Committee on Population, Family and Children said among 66 HIV-positive children who were questioned (including orphans, and those children living in families with HIV/AIDS) in Ha Long City in Quang Ninh Province, the drop-out rate among children was 13 per cent. The number of children who never even went to school was seven per cent. Up to 39 per cent of 23 school-aged children have completely left the education system. In Tan Chau District in An Giang Province, nine out of 12 questioned HIV-infected children do not go to school. Besides economic difficulties, discrimination from society toward people with HIV/AIDS is the main reason children living with the condition wonâ€™t continue their education. ""I dropped out of school because my friends stopped playing with me as soon as they knew my parents were living with HIV/AIDS,"" a 16-year-old girl said. Parents and people who are looking after HIV-infected children in Tan Chau District admitted their children were often under pressure from classmates ""My friends do not dare to sit next to me,"" said one child.

Seven-year-old Linh (not her real name) in Cam Pha town neglected her learning because she said the deadly disease would cause her to die like her father. In another case, a 16-year-old girl who has been orphaned because her parents both died of AIDS said: ""I only want to stay at home and do not want to go to school.""

For over 13 years, she has helped wash and care for patients â€“ even during their final moments â€“ even when many other people, including their family members, are afraid of being infected. â€” VNS Photo The Van by Bich Huong HA NOI (VNS) â€” At Nhat Tan Market in Tay Ho District, 57-year-old Bui Thi Dong is known as ""Dong AIDS"" or ""Dong Drugs"". Its not because this lady has the disease or uses drugs, its because for more than 13 years, she has been the last line of support for HIV/AIDS patients. Since 2000, Dong has helped countless AIDS patients, some in the final stages of the disease. She encourages families not to abandon them and to stay with them until the end. She has no money for her volunteer work, but is so well-known that even families of AIDS patients from near-by districts come to her for help. Dongs kindness has spread beyond her district and made her something of a local celebrity, but she doesnt really like all the attention. ""I do it as a good deed. I saw that many people were scared of helping sufferers because they were afraid they would become infected too, or simply didnt know how to assist them,"" she said. For 20 years, she has been spending more time at the market than at her house since her first son died at the age of 25 and daughter-in-law died aged 22, both from HIV/AIDS, about ten years ago. Her second son â€“ a drug addict â€“ has spent years in rehab. One day, one of the other market traders came to Dongs tea stand and asked her: ""Do you have no work today, Mrs AIDS?"" ""The fact she is here now means that no one in the village is going to die of AIDS today,"" explained a fruit-seller next to Dongs stall. ""Whenever she gets a phone call or people come to talk about something related to HIV/AIDS, she leaves the stall without warning."" Nhat Tan Village became a second home for Dong 40 years ago after she left her hometown in the northern province of Thai Binh to work as a brick layer for a construction company in Ha Noi. In those 40 years, Dong has spent 30 preparing dead bodies for their final rituals as her way of enforcing a belief in a spiritual life after death. ""Villagers ask me to help them enshroud the dead bodies because they believe that if the ritual is performed correctly and with care, then the dead can pass away in peace and avoid bad luck,"" she said. However, in her worse nightmares, Dong never thought that she would be the only one to perform this last task for AIDS victims after her children died. She was devastated by their deaths and the way her fellow villagers discriminated against AIDS patients. ""When I was informed that my first son was a drug addict and had become infected with HIV/AIDS in 1990, I had no idea about the disease except that it was an infectious fatal disease and a social evil,"" she said. But as a mother, Dong did everything possible to save her son, including selling her own blood and taking out high-interest loans to pay for his medical expenses. ""After suffering for ten years, my 25-year-old son still dreamed of getting married and having a small family of his own, and he wanted to marry another villager who was also living with HIV at that time,"" she said. Regardless of the dangerous virus, she accepted the marriage because they were human beings with the right to live happily. More burdens were placed on her shoulders, but she said she has no regrets. ""Sometimes, I was scared that I could become infected, but I was reassured by regular blood tests in the city,"" she said. ""As a mother, I was the last person my children could rely on."" After that, other villagers whose loved-ones were dying from AIDS also started coming to Dong for help. In 2000, her first case was a 22-year-old male drug addict who had been receiving medical treatment in Tan Ky District, central Nghe An Province. For his last wish, his family returned him to the village. For two days, the family wore gloves and were afraid of being infected. They did not know how to care for him. Dong said she bought him food and helped him to wash. ""I knew he would not give me an infection,"" she remembered. ""He thanked me before passing away."" Dong set up a voluntary group to assist people living with HIV/AIDS in Nhat Tan Ward in 2011. Bui Van De, one of the group members and head of the wards Red-Cross Society, said that the 40 members - including people living with HIV/AIDS, their families and representatives of local social organizations - have been working to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS prevention, how HIV/AIDS carriers can take care of themselves and how family members can help. ""Dongs kindness cannot be found elsewhere,"" he said. ""She does this to ease the discrimination and suffering that the patients have to bear."" In 2005, Dong started going on various training activities run by international organisations on HIV/AIDS prevention and control. But for local villagers, no training or expertise can replace her, because she does her work out of love. ""I think of the patients as my children,"" Dong said. ""My reward is receiving their gratitude before they die."" â€” VNS",Society,"['devotes', 'tea', 'patients', 'tan', 'hivaids', 'dong', 'son', 'aids', 'life', 'infected', 'members', 'work', 'seller', 'family']","Bui Thi Dong, 57, of Ha Noi's Nhat Tan Ward, prepares to reach families of HIV/ AIDS patients on her old bike.

Buddhism shines light into HIV/AIDS darkness,"The pagoda can't offer material needs to anyone, but it offers inspiring words of encouragement, empathy and has a strong wish to share the difficulties of people living with HIV/AIDS.",[],2014-05-04,vietnamnews.vn,"Inspiring compassion: Monk Thich Thanh Huan (third left) shares his knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection with devotees visiting his pagoda. â€” Photo Phap Van Pagoda files by Hong Thuy When I arrived, Nguyen Van Kien (name changed) was lying on a bare, rickety bed made of thin wooden planks. It was a cool March morning. There were five similar beds arranged in a narrow, basement room of the Phap Van Pagoda in Ha Nois Thanh Tri District. The room was dimly lit, with half-open windows. I could hardly see anyone inside; just silhouettes on the beds divided by makeshift curtains. Only when Kien moved to the empty bed, which was at an arms length from me, did I see his face. Clad in a blue jeans and T-shirt, Kien looked rather healthy for someone who had been diagnosed with the dreaded Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). ""No one thought that I was alive, including the doctors at the Bach Mai Hospital,"" the 35 year-old-man recalled. ""My family and monk Thich Thanh Huan saved my life and made me feel that I was not abandoned,"" he said. Kien was in anguish and desperate when he first contracted the HIV virus in 2006. He attempted to commit suicide on numerous occasions by injecting himself with lethal drug overdoses and not caring about living a healthy life to slow the progress of full-blown AIDS. Yet, good quality of care, empathy, and encouragement from his family and the monk helped Kien lead a balanced and longer life. ""I realise that overthinking and depression can make me more vulnerable to the illness, so I prefer to be in the company of people facing a similar dilemma like me. In the pagoda I can meet and talk to my peers,"" he said. Earlier, Kien had no place to go except the Ha Noi Lung Hospital, which he frequented for receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). He started visiting the pagoda four years ago after Monk Thich Thanh Huans visit to his house. The monk had dropped in to inquire about his health, and invited him to participate in clubs for people living with HIV/AIDS. Kien confessed to have been visibly moved by the good intentions of the monk who showed genuine interest in his well-being and was keen to help him overcome difficulties, though they had never met before. Sharing similar feelings, Hoang Phuong Lam (not her real name) claimed that she would have died had she not met the monk who offered her shelter and informed her about the use of ART for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection. ""Mental factors can lead to life or death situations among people living with HIV/AIDS. The discrimination of the people in my homeland makes me feel like a fish out water. Even now, I do not dare to return home to visit my loved ones,"" Lam remarked. Having married in 2003, Lam knew she had contracted the HIV virus from her life partner, a drug user, a year later. Since then, no one wants to come to her tailoring shop to have their suits made. Many people did not even return to collect their finished garments after they heard about the fatal virus that Lam carried. ""People did not want to sit next to me for fear of being infected with the virus. Even my nephews mother told him that he should not take any food that I gave him,"" Lam, 36, recalled. Loneliness and isolation had jeopardised her health, though it was only three years since she contracted the virus. When Lam met the monk in 2007, she had already developed AIDS as a result of her HIV infection. Counselling centre Sitting cross-legged in a lotus posture with one lap of his brown robe covered on it, monk Thich Thanh Huan was the epitome of warmth and kindness as he greeted me with a genuine smile. ""When people living with HIV/AIDS come to the pagoda to seek help, I understand that they feel alone, isolated, and frightened at times. Thus, they look forward to having peace in their life. They are in dire need of help. This motivated me to set up a counselling and care centre for people living with HIV/AIDS,"" said the monk. Founded in 2003, the centre has attracted several thousand people who have benefited from spiritual counselling, information and food. Many have been given assistance in the form of free screening and treatment for HIV infection. They have also been provided shelter when they were in a state of shock, and have been advised on how to live a healthy lifestyle. ""The pagoda cant offer material needs to anyone, but it offers inspiring words of encouragement, empathy and has a strong wish to share the difficulties of people living with HIV/AIDS,"" explained monk Thich Thanh Huan. In keeping with the spirit of life engagement and pursuit of happiness among humans, which is the essence of Vietnamese Buddhism, the monk stated that he wants to give hope and faith to the victims of HIV/AIDS. He has helped set up clubs for HIV-infected people to interact and share information about HIV/AIDS prevention and protection. The monk considers every pagoda-goer equal. Not surprisingly, the Phap Van pagoda has become a place of refuge for several people living with HIV/AIDS. Fighting stigma In 63 cities and provinces across the country, pagodas have been offering counselling to HIV/AIDS victims and partaking in movements to stem out the associated stigma and discrimination, according to Standing Vice President of Buddhist Sangha of Viet Nam (BSV)s Executive Council, Most Venerable Thich Thanh Nhieu. It is no wonder that their contributions play a vital role in helping Viet Nam control the outbreak of the HIV epidemic. According to the Millennium Development Goals report released last year by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Viet Nam has successfully managed to reduce the number of new cases of HIV infection as well as HIV-related deaths in the recent years. Over a 11-month-period in 2012, the number of reported HIV cases dropped by 22 per cent and the number of deaths decreased nearly threefold. Overall, Viet Nam has successfully contained HIV prevalence to under 0.3 per cent, which is lower than the target set by the now superseded national 2004-2010 strategy. The report revealed that there were 208,866 HIV-positive cases, 59,839 AIDS patients, and 62,184 AIDS-related deaths in Viet Nam in 2012. In spite of these achievements, challenges prevail, the report added. There is a high risk of an outbreak within some communities like HCM City and Ha Noi; poor coverage of HIV screening programmes in remote and economically disadvantaged areas; limited patient access to needles, syringes, and condoms; insufficient provision of ART to people living with HIV/AIDS; and funding constraints. Confronting such challenges, Monk Thich Thanh Huan noted that Vietnamese Buddhism entering social life (life engagement) is a major concern among Vietnamese monks and nuns, who take responsibility to bring happiness to people and peace to the society. ""We do not have money to offer, but we are able to improve peoples lives through implementing the Buddhist spirit of mercy, fraternity, and salvation,"" the monk explained. Vesak goals Life engagement is also a linchpin to be highlighted at the imminent Vesak Day, which falls on May 7, an officially recognized United Nations holiday that celebrates the birth of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. Under the theme ""Buddhist Perspective towards Achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals"", the event will mark a milestone for Vietnamese Buddhism to showcase to the world that it will work in tandem with other countries to solve global issues, though being simultaneously involved in charity work to bring happiness to the lives of the people, which has been followed ever since Buddhism was introduced in Viet Nam more than 2,000 years ago. ""Buddhism, a religion of mercy, happiness, and salvation for all human beings, always applies its rules to serve the nation and mankind. Understanding this, the BSV has been focusing on improving the lives of the underprivileged, the elderly, women, children, and other marginalized people,"" remarked Most Venerable Thich Thanh Nhieu. For years, the Executive Boards of the BSV in cities and provinces have provided financial assistance to the impoverished in flooded, remote, and mountainous regions, showed gratitude to the families of war invalid soldiers and martyrs by building schools and houses for them, cared for children with disabilities in orphanages and care centres, built charity classes to educate children of impoverished parents, and provided care to the elderly, Agent Orange victims, leprosy, HIV-infected, and mentally ill patients, among others. Last year saw the SBV spending more than VND1,200 billion (US$60 million) on Buddhist charity activities. While Buddhism in its essence is humanism, the nature of charity work means bringing Buddhism to life. The famous declaration of Buddha in the prayer ""Serve all living beings means to worship Buddha"" is the basic principle of the socially engaged Buddhism. Clearly, Buddha realised that the purpose of his life was not to serve himself, but he hoped that through his lectures humans will serve themselves and bring happiness and goodness to everyone. In other words, the very nature of Buddhism is oriented towards serving mankind. This is also a message that Vietnamese Buddhism continues to commit to its volition and enthusiasm to bring equality and happiness to mankind in this years Vesak Day. The five-day event will be held in Bai Dinh pagoda in the northern province of Ninh Binh. â€” VNS",Sunday,"['pagoda', 'buddhism', 'thanh', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'monk', 'viet', 'shines', 'life', 'thich', 'light', 'darkness']","Inspiring compassion: Monk Thich Thanh Huan (third left) shares his knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection with devotees visiting his pagoda.

Ngu Duy Anh, head of the Student Affairs Department under the Ministry of Education and Training, said social stigma and discrimination towards HIV/AIDS-affected children had reduced over the past three years, with most attending classes in centres and schools. ""In particular, there are more than 300 students living with HIV/AIDS who are able to maintain their studying in public shools without meeting any discrimination,"" he said. Nguyen Thi Phuong, director of Ha Nois Social Labour and Education Centre No.2, said voluntary teachers were holding daily classes for affected children taken into care by the centre. In addition, they received tuition from their adoptive mother, brothers and sisters, she added. Phuong said these children also had lots of chances to play games with local children. Anh said nearly 65 per cent of children affected by HIV/AIDS had been offered health care services. More than 3,560 HIV/AIDS children were being treated with the Antiretroviral drug (ARV), 25 times more than seven years ago. Measures to prevent the spread of the disease from mothers to babies had been applied to reduce the large number of new infections. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said the basic rights of many children to access education and health services had yet to be realised. Nguyen Thi Hoan, teacher of Bac Giang Provinces Mo Trang High School said children affected by this disease who suffer social stigma and discrimination would suffer much more than adults and could develop long-term psychological issues. ""However, many are still being driven away from public schools where parents of other students are opposed to integration,"" she said. Doan Mau Diep, deputy minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said it would be a long fight to totally stop social stigma towards the children, so it is necesary to boost communication campaigns and change peoples prejudices about this disease. Anh agreed and said more than 22 million students nationwide would be a main force to remove social discrimination toward the affected children in the coming time, so proper knowledge and preventive measures against HIV/AIDS were being integrated into main teaching subjects such as biology, literature, geography and civics. In addition, extra-curricular activies with themes of HIV/AIDS were also held regularly at schools from kindergartens right up to higher-education level, he said. There were also meetings for parents providing basic information about the disease, he added. Phuc asked relevant agencies to update statistics about children living with and affected by this disease, so that proper assistance policies can be developed.â€” VNS",Society,"['social', 'affected', 'services', 'students', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'disease', 'discrimination', 'society', 'stigma', 'shunned', 'education', 'children']","HA NOI (VNS)â€” Despite receiving adequate education and health services, the overwhelming majority of Viet Nam's 457,691 children affected by HIV/AIDS are still blocked from fully integrating with society.

"More needs to be done to fight HIV infection, support victims",Viet Nam News spoke with US Ambassador to Viet Nam Michael W Marine about the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam.,[],2007-08-01,vietnamnews.vn,"More needs to be done to fight HIV infection, support victims (02-08-2007) Viet Nam News spoke with US Ambassador to Viet Nam Michael W Marine about the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam. What is your assessment of the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam in comparison with other countries around the world and particularly with the 14 other focus countries of the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar)? Well, HIV/AIDS is different in various countries around the world. We have a problem with HIV/AIDS in the United States as well. Here in Viet Nam it is an epidemic that has been concentrated, for the most part, among high-risk groups, including people who use injected drugs and commercial sex workers, but there are signs that the epidemic is beginning to spill out again into the general population and that is very worrisome. The HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam is serious but I know the percentage of cases is lower than Pepfarâ€™s 14 other countries which should mean we can have great success because the epidemic is still relatively limited. But to succeed takes great efforts. Its not just the health-care workers but the educators, the Ministry of Labour, public security; many levels of government that have a role to play in this effort. More needs to be done to create greater lines of communication and make efforts even more effective. I think a tremendous amount of good work is being done, led by the Ministry of Health but involving many other people. The US is the single largest bilateral donor to Viet Nam and weâ€™re also a major donor to the Global Fund. There are three aspects in dealing with HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam and around the world: prevention â€“ preventing new cases; treatment - improving treatment and helping people who are HIV positive or have AIDS; and care â€“ this is a complex issue but involves helping people who have been affected by being a member of a family where HIV/AIDS is present, the orphans who have lost parents to HIV/AIDS and providing care for people who are at any stage of the illness, particularly those who are dying and for whom treatment wonâ€™t be effective. In terms of treatment and care there is still much work to be accomplished but we are doing a good job. In the area of prevention however, I am concerned, we have not yet reached - and this is not only in Viet Nam but around the world â€“ to the point where we are preventing enough cases. There are too many new cases, too many new infections. We now have ways of keeping people alive through drugs and enabling them to live full lives. But that is expensive. There is a cost to society and if there are too many new cases the bill keeps going up, and that is very worrisome. How has the situation changed since your arrival in 2004 when Viet Nam became the 15th member country of the Pepfar programme? It has changed a good deal, we have a lot more money now to work with. The funding through the Pepfar mechanism has given us more resources to tackle HIV/AIDS here in Vietnam. I have seen a significant increase in joint efforts among the various donors to consolidate what we are doing, to co-ordinate, and ensure we are covering as much of the problem as possible without overlap. I have also seen a much improved level of dialogue and co-operation between the donor community and the Government. As I said earlier, because there are still more than 100 people each day becoming HIV positive in Viet Nam, we cannot relax, we are not winning yet, we are doing better but we are still not winning. We need to work harder and smarter. Until we can educate people about what HIV is and what it is not, there are people who will still find themselves infected, we need to improve prevention efforts in a concrete way. The amount of money Pepfar spent on the fight went up from US$34 million in the 2006 fiscal year to $66 million for 2007, it is a sign that there is good work to be done but we still need more money. With $25 million we can make limited efforts; with $65 million we can do more things, expand our consul and testing programme, we can build new partnerships with laboratories to increase our capacity for testing. More funding is needed to defeat the epidemic. We now have quite a bit of money, we need to use that money well, we need to have effective programmes working on prevention, treatment and care. The Pepfar money is only part of it. There is the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, the British Government and the Global Fund - which is something many donors contribute to - specifically dealing with HIV, Malaria and TB. The whole idea of Pepfar is results. What we call goals. We want to have 22,000 people receiving treatment in Viet Nam by the end of 2008. Another target is preventing over 600,000 cases. Measuring success in terms of cases is very difficult. You canâ€™t necessarily attribute results to particular programs, but we do try to measure results and that makes it easier to go back to Congress and ask for additional funding. You know that President Bush has announced that he wants Pepfar to continue. Pepfar was originally organised for the period between 2004 and 2008, now we are planning for the second phase, between 2009 and 2013. He wants aid to double from $15 billion to $30 billion and that is a large amount of money. But it goes back to what I said earlier, if we donâ€™t succeed in prevention, no amount of money will be enough. You will have to keep spending money on treatment, that is why prevention is so important. What are the current challenges in carrying out the programme in Viet Nam? We have to keep up good lines of communication with our partners. I meet with the leadership of the Pepfar team every two weeks and we discuss what needs to be done. I think an issue besides prevention is stigma and discrimination, how do we integrate the people who are HIV positive or have AIDS into the community so their children can go to school without any problems, and their neighbours will treat them like anyone else? When I travel around the country I talk to leaders at the provincial level. I think most of them are trying to deal with this issue. Things have improved in Viet Nam since the new HIV/AIDS law was passed but if you went outside and talked to people on the street you would find there is still prejudice, misconception and misunderstanding about how you can get it and what that means. All that needs to be changed. What will be the challenges for Viet Nam over the next five years? I think the challenges will be as I already described them. Good lines of communication between the government and non-government organisations. Efforts to increase public diplomacy. Efforts to integrate. Coming up with an effective strategy and plan for dealing with the prevention issue. There are many aspects, for example I believe that there has to be a component in the educational system that teaches about HIV/AIDS. That doesnâ€™t mean every week, but once or twice in the school year. It needs to be age sensitive, it needs to be good information and presented in a way that young people can understand.",Opinion,"['treatment', 'cases', 'infection', 'fight', 'nam', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'needs', 'money', 'prevention', 'good', 'efforts', 'pepfar', 'victims', 'support']","More needs to be done to fight HIV infection, support victims(02-08-2007)Viet Nam News spoke with US Ambassador to Viet Nam Michael W Marine about the HIV/AIDS situation in Viet Nam.

At the meeting, entitled ""Protect women and children in a world of AIDS"", many women described their experiences of living with the dreaded disease. Nguyen Thi Le, a member of ""dong cam"" (sympathy), a social advocacy group, in An Lu Commune, Thuy Nguyen District, had to fight social discrimination after her husband died of HIV/AIDS. Nguyenâ€™s husband became an addict after leading a listless life and the fragile happiness of her small house disappeared after her husbandâ€™s death. The austere woman had to overcome societal discrimination to take care of her old mother and three small children. Le then became a member of the group in the hope of sharing and getting help from other patients. Describing her experience in tears, Nguyen Thi Anh, another member of the group, said how shocked she was on hearing her son, on whom she had laid all her hopes, had contracted the disease and would die in the near future. She then joined the group and shared her grief with members who were sympathetic and helped her to overcome the trauma. Anh is now is one of the key members in the propaganda team on raising HIV/AIDS awareness of the union. Anh said the society should help the victims by opening their hearts and removing their complexes. The two women are among hundreds of women in the 30 ""dong cam"" groups in Hai Phong. Each member has their own story but all share the same pain. Among them, some are innocent victims of HIV/AIDS who caught the infection from family members. They have courageously broken the prejudice by integrating into the society and many like Nguyen Thi Hue of Ha Ly ward, Hong Bang District, who was awarded the Asian Heroine 2004, are actively participating in prevention and awareness campaigns. ""Social advocacy groups not only help family members to deal with the problems of stress but also meets the needs of the society. The clubs are places where members can share their difficulties and gain confidence in life,"" said Le Thu Cuc, Vice Chairwoman of Hai Phong Womenâ€™s Union.

Drama sheds light on HIV/AIDS,The Youth Theatre on Monday hosted a special art performance programme at the HCM City Opera House in response to World AIDS Day and the countryâ€™s national action month for HIV/AIDS control (November 10-December 10).,[],2009-12-11,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” The Youth Theatre on Monday hosted a special art performance programme at the HCM City Opera House in response to World AIDS Day and the countryâ€™s national action month for HIV/AIDS control (November 10-December 10). The programme has received support from the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The main part of the programme was the drama Stereo Man and the Destinations of Lives, which was developed based on the original Stereo Man directed and choreographed by Acnes Locsin from the Philippines. The performance was the outcome of cooperation between the Youth Theatre and PEPFAR as part of the project Art for Development in Viet Nam. The drama addresses the spiritual and physical lives of young people who are exposed to HIV/AIDS risks, and emphasises their humanity. â€œOver the next five years, the US will place a renewed emphasis on partnering with Viet Nam to build a national HIV/AIDS response,â€� said US Consul General Kenneth J Fairfax. â€œWe will continue to work together with all sectors of the Vietnamese government and society as they craft strategies and programmes to stop HIV/AIDS,â€� Fairfax said. Since 2004, the US government has provided more than US$320 million through PEPFAR to comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment, and support activities nationwide. Currently, more than 30,700 AIDS patients in the country have access to anti-retroviral treatment, as well as more than 3,300 pregnant women infected with HIV. In addition, more than 260,000 people have taken part in voluntary counseling and testing services this year.

The US$2.5 million project, funded by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, would be implemented until September 2014 in HCM City and the northern province of Thai Nguyen, deputy head of the Social Evils Prevention Department (SEPD) Do Thi Ninh Xuan said. Its objectives are to strengthen the ministry (MoLISA) s capacity to treat and rehabilitate drug addicts through effective approach methods to reduce drug use, improve the quality of life, and reduce HIV infection among drug users and prostitutes. The project is setting up a data collection and management system on drug addicts, prostitutes and addicted prostitutes, according to MoLISA. The capacity of the ministrys staff to analyse and utilise data will be also improved. Viet Nam has close to 150,000 registered addicts, a figure that has been growing by 6,000 a year since. All 63 cities and provinces have them. Along with the increase, the demographics of drug addicts underwent remarkable change, MoLISA said. In the mid-1990s drug use was common among people living in the northern mountains. Since the mid-2000s the number of addicts has been increasing rapidly in the Red River Delta and south-eastern regions. The addicts have also been growing younger â€“ in 2010 around 70 per cent were under 30 compared to 42 per cent in 1995. More than 95 per cent of users in Viet Nam are men. But the number of women addicts has been increasing. The method of use has also changed: in 1995 less than 8 per cent were injecting drugs while more than 88 per cent were smoking them; 14 years later three-fourths of addicts are intravenous users. This has led to an alarming rise in HIV infection. Figures from the Ministry of Health show that addicts using needles account for most of the people with HIV. A recent MoLISA survey found that the majority of the drug addicts were poorly educated with more than half not going to high school and 10 per cent being illiterate, only 12 per cent getting vocational training. With drug abuse rising, MoLISA said treatment of addicts and training to help them return to the community and integrate was essential. It said it planned to review the rehabilitation system for investment in community-based treatment and improved management. A number of models would be tried to treat some 500 addicts.",Society,"['ministry', 'project', 'molisa', 'hcm', 'hiv', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'addicts', 'aims', 'cent', 'number', 'slow', 'improving', 'treatment']","Its objectives are to strengthen the ministry (MoLISA) 's capacity to treat and rehabilitate drug addicts through effective approach methods to reduce drug use, improve the quality of life, and reduce HIV infection among drug users and prostitutes.

Role of leadership highlighted in the fight against HIV/AIDS,"While Viet Nam is forecast to be on the verge of an HIV/AIDS outbreak, many believe the role of leadership in combating the pandemic is very important.",[],2006-01-11,vietnamnews.vn,"Role of leadership highlighted in the fight against HIV/AIDS (11-01-2006) Doctors check samples for the HIV virus in the northern mountain province of Yen Bai.â€” VNA/VNS Photo Huu Oai HA NOI â€” While Viet Nam is forecast to be on the verge of an HIV/AIDS outbreak, many believe the role of leadership in combating the pandemic is very important. ""As the disease has claimed the lives of thousands of people, the role of leaders in nations fighting HIV/AIDS is of dire importance,"" said Tommy G Thompson, former secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services. Thompson chairs the 13-member delegation visiting Viet Nam to evaluate the HIV pandemic in Viet Nam, assess current national efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, including critical gaps and emerging challenges, and identify opportunities for pre-emptive US engagement to help fight the spread of HIV/AIDS. 100,000 living with AIDS Viet Nam has had more than 100,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, according to a report released by the Health Ministry at the end of last year. About 11,000 people have died of the disease. Yet, it is believed the actual number of HIV/AIDS carriers is much higher. Associate professor Luu Thi Minh Chau at the Health Ministry said the number of people with HIV/AIDS is forecast around two to three times higher than the reported figures. Chau warned that Viet Nam, like other countries in Asia, will likely suffer from an HIV/AIDS outbreak in the early years of the 21st century if drastic measures are not carried out in a timely manner. The situation has become critical as the country is increasingly open, exposing the population to the disease through sexually transmitted diseases and drugs, she added. Viet Nam is one of fifteen â€˜focusâ€™ countries identified as countries most at risk for an HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are the beneficiaries of the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, a five-year, US$15 billion, US global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS. In addition to completing a series of objectives in stopping the spread of the disease, the programme also aims to strengthen the role of leadership in fighting HIV/AIDS. Last year, Viet Nam received a total of US$25 million from the programme. Like other beneficiaries, Viet Nam expects to receive further support from the PEPFAR programme to obtain better results in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The country has received support from other international organisations to combat HIV/AIDS, of which the US PEPFAR programme is one. ""Viet Nam is grateful to the US Government for supporting the country in fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS,"" said Dao Duy Quat, deputy head of the Party Central Commission for Ideological and Cultural Affairs. Quat told Thompson at a meeting on Monday in Ha Noi that Vietnamese leaders have been very involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS over the past decade. ""We are combating the pandemic to save not only people living with HIV/AIDS but also to save the whole nation,"" Quat said. As soon as the first HIV case was discovered in Viet Nam more than 10 years ago, the Party was very prompt to issue a directive on HIV/AIDS prevention and protection in 1995. It was followed by the promulgation of an HIV/AIDS prevention and protection ordinance. Viet Nam also has a legal framework for the protection and prevention of HIV/AIDS. The issuance of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection strategies and the imminent introduction of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection laws are efforts the country has made to combat the pandemic. Quat said Viet Nam has also attached great importance to disseminating information and educating people about HIV/AIDS.

Children: the forgotten victims of HIV,World AIDS Day next Tuesday will highlight a human rights-based approach to dealing with the scourge .,[],2009-11-26,vietnamnews.vn,"Outlook (27-11-2009) Children: the forgotten victims of HIV World AIDS Day next Tuesday will highlight a human rights-based approach to dealing with the scourge. by Nguyen Kieu Van Viet Nam continued to set an example for the Asia-Pacific region when Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved the National Plan of Action for Children Living with and Affected by HIV/AIDS in June. The plan to 2010 with a vision to 2020 was part of Viet Namâ€™s response to the appeal for governments to provide such action at the East Asia and Pacific Regional Consultation on HIV-AIDS conference in Ha Noi in 2006. But while the efforts of Viet Namâ€™s and other Asia-Pacific-country governments to implement healthcare policies and support for children living with and affected by HIV-AIDS have been acknowledged, the results have not always matched the expectations of those whose lives have been blighted by the virus. As United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund, or UNICEF, representative in Viet Nam Jesper Morch explains: ""Viet Nam has excellent policies and legislation in place. But policies and legislation are sometimes difficult to enforce."" Double burden Many of the affected children carry a double burden: Not only have they lost one or both parents to AIDS or are living with the HIV virus themselves; they are also without caregivers and lack the opportunity to learn. Vietnamese Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, who well knows the plight of these children, puts it best: ""The pain to their spirit following the death of their parents is made much worse by the discrimination they suffer from those around them."" The epidemic has limited their basic rights. But progress is being made. A UNAIDS report issued in Shanghai on Tuesday says HIV infections have fallen 17 per cent over the past eight years. The heaviest fall was in East Asia - almost 25 per cent. ""The good news is that we have evidence that the declines we are seeing are due, at least in part, to HIV prevention,"" says UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe. ""If we do a better job of getting resources and programmes to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved."" The Indonesian National AIDS Commission has provided a particularly impressive initiative with the extension of a life-skills education programme that empowers communities in the management of the virus in the countryâ€™s remote Papua Province. UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office director Anupama Rao Singh is also quick to acknowledge the progress but advises: ""Governments and civil societies should strengthen the evidence about the impact AIDS has on children and put them on a properly costed National Strategic Plan for protection, prevention care and support. ""Given the low-level and concentrated nature of the HIV pandemic in the Asia-Pacific, the best response is to engage in integrated programmes to promote overall child welfare and reduce poverty,"" she says. In addition to the early identification of the disease, policies to support AIDS orphans through loans or job training are also necessary. Such programmes should begin at the grassroots. Many government and NGO studies reveal why such action is necessary. These show that children living with and affected by HIV are more vulnerable to ill health, malnutrition, psychosocial suffering, slowed cognitive development, anxiety, depression, abandonment and abuse. Changing patterns Anupama Rao Singh warns the number of children living with HIV in Asia-Pacific is increasing. ""This is because patterns of HIV infection are changing,"" she says. ""An increasingly large number of women not traditionally considered to be members of high-risk groups are becoming infected."" More than 43 per cent of new infections in Cambodia were among married women and more than a third of all new infections were from mother to child. Most HIV infections in children are transmitted from mother to child and this makes early diagnosis through the universal testing of pregnant women and the provision of ART prophylaxis regimens to those infected crucial. Vietnamese minister Ngan says high-risk children should be a focus of attention. These include drug users; children who have both parents affected by HIV or those who live at social centres; street children and victims of human trafficking or sexual abuse. But the Asia-Pacific has more orphans than anywhere else in the world-an estimated 90 million â€“ and so poor children living with HIV in poor countries are all but overlooked. They receive little support from governments and civil organisations and without money cannot buy the pharmaceutical drugs that would save their lives. Each year an estimated 93 per cent of children living with HIV in poor countries go without access to effective treatment. The result: 18.4 per cent of the worldâ€™s yearly AIDSâ€™s dead are children. Most died because their parents did not have access to ART prophylaxis Regimens while their health centres lacked testing equipment and the necessary medicine. The fact that the drugs suitable for children cost four to five times more than those for adults exacerbates the problem. It means that governments, the World Health Organisation and the global pharmaceutical corporations must give priority to HIV testing, examination and the supply of the necessary drugs to the children in poor countries. Doctors Without Borders has set the example. It has supplied free prophylaxis regimens to people living with HIV in 29 poor countries. Surely, most of the beneficiaries were children. UNAIDS estimates number of people living with HIV globally at 33.4 million. The agency puts the number of children afflicted at 2.3 million with 95 per cent of them in poor countries mostly sub-Saharan Africa. â€” VNS",Opinion,"['poor', 'affected', 'living', 'hiv', 'viet', 'cent', 'aids', 'forgotten', 'policies', 'victims', 'children', 'governments']","These show that children living with and affected by HIV are more vulnerable to ill health, malnutrition, psychosocial suffering, slowed cognitive development, anxiety, depression, abandonment and abuse.

"More must be done to fight drug abuse, HIV: Deputy PM","Although great efforts have been made in tackling drug abuse in Viet Nam, the problem continues to grow, said Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong yesterday at a forum on curbing drug use and the spread of HIV/AIDS.",[],2006-08-23,vietnamnews.vn,"More must be done to fight drug abuse, HIV: Deputy PM (23-08-2006) Ha Noi â€” Although great efforts have been made in tackling drug abuse in Viet Nam, the problem continues to grow, said Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong yesterday at a forum on curbing drug use and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The international Forum on Development, Drugs and HIV in the Highlands of Viet Nam was organised by Viet Namâ€™s Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). It was held to provide a venue to share information on drug trafficking and abuse, and the spread of HIV among ethnic minorities in the northern mountainous areas. The forum provided participants with a chance to share experiences in preventative work on drug abuse and HIV infection. It also provided Vietnamese authorities with the opportunity to call for support from international organisations, NGOs and the wider community in tackling the problem. Speaking at the forum yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong said that ""Although great efforts have been made to tackle the problems, drug abuse continues to grow, especially with an increasing shift from opium smoking to injecting, which aids the spread of HIV in the northern mountainous areas."" ""Unless proper actions are taken, it is predicted that in the next 5 to 10 years, drug abuse and HIV infection will become serious epidemics in the area, endangering the development of communities in the highlands, where knowledge on the relationship between HIV and injecting drugs is largely non-existent,"" said Trong. Since 2002, the UNODC in partnership with CEM have been carrying out a project on preventing drug abuse among ethnic minorities in Viet Nam. This project has so far obtained initial positive results, contributing to curbing drug abuse. However, according to a report released by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, the highlands region faces serious economic difficulties and rampant drug abuse. Opium poppy cultivation and use has a long history among ethnic minorities, said the report, revealing that in 2005 the number of drug users in the northern mountainous provinces accounted for 37.8 per cent of the countryâ€™s total population of known drug users. Notably, since 1999, opium smokers have turned to heroin use. Synthetic drugs have been used in the provinces of Nghe An, Lao Cai, Ha Giang, Son La, Dien Bien and Lai Chau. The past few years have seen an increase in drug injections, accounting for 70-80 per cent of drug use in some areas, and resulting in the rise of HIV/AIDS. The report highlighted the provinces of Nghe An, Thanh Hoa and Yen Bai, where between 80-90 per cent of HIV cases are drug users. According to the UNODC project co-ordinator, Jason Eligh, prevention of drug use and the spread of HIV/AIDS was very important to socio-economic development in the northern highland region, where poor infrastructure has exacerbated the areas remoteness. A workshop on Viet Namâ€™s NGOs and HIV/AIDS prevention and control was also held in Ha Noi yesterday. Deputy Director of the Viet Nam Administration of AIDS Control Chu Quoc An called on NGOs to co-ordinate activities and develop projects in localities to prevent and control the disease. National strategy Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) should focus their activities on disseminating the Law on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control and implementing the national strategy, he said. NGOs had contributed heavily for the countryâ€™s HIV/AIDS prevention and control programmes, and many articles of the new law encourages and creates conditions for NGOs to increase their activities, An said. Thanks to the support of NGOs, the number of people and social organisations taking part in the programme has increased. An said there were a dozen NGOs operating in HIV/AIDS prevention and control, but most of them were small or short-term projects. Representatives of NGOs presented reports on activities in localities and provided detailed information on community HIV/AIDS prevention and control. They called for effective co-ordination between State management agencies, social organisations and domestic and international NGOs in order to cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Chung A, an expert on HIV/AIDS, said the NGOs had been operating effectively in the country over the past ten years and Viet Nam was one of the nations that had shown progress in removing stigma and preventing discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients. ""It is necessary to have close co-ordination between NGOs for effective use of human resources and funds,"" Chung A said.",Society,"['deputy', 'spread', 'fight', 'hiv', 'abuse', 'drug', 'ngos', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'prevention', 'control', 'organisations']","More must be done to fight drug abuse, HIV: Deputy PM(23-08-2006)Ha Noi â€” Although great efforts have been made in tackling drug abuse in Viet Nam, the problem continues to grow, said Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong yesterday at a forum on curbing drug use and the spread of HIV/AIDS.

Funds lacking for HIV medicine,"Demand for anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines for people living with HIV/AIDS continues to grow but the State's budget allocation for purchasing ARVs is limited, said Bui Duc Duong, deputy director of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) under the Ministry of Health.",[],2015-05-20,vietnamnews.vn,"People share information and experiences about HIV/AIDS prevention and control in a conference.

ARV medications help people living with HIV strengthen their immune system and thereby decrease the risk of contracting other diseases and illnesses; co-infection is the leading cause of death amongst the HIV/AIDS community in Viet Nam. The Government of Viet Nam first allowed ARV medicines into the country in 2000 but they only became widely used in 2007. ARVs have proven successful in Viet Nam. Before 2007, 7,000-8,000 people died annually from AIDS, but in recent years numbers have been between 1,000-1,500. In 2013, Viet Nam required more than VND350 billion (US$16.6 million) to buy ARVs. The state budget paid for only 6.3 per cent of the needed funds and the rest came from international sponsors. Last year, the country required 400 billion ($19 million) and only 4.4 per cent came from the State budget. With advanced notice about a decrease in financial support this year from Viet Nams two biggest sponsors, the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS and the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the State decided to up its financial support, spending VND85 billion ($4 million) on ARVs. ""But the fund is still not enough to meet the real demand,"" said Duong. According to the VAAC website, the number of patients requiring ARVs will increase by almost 50,000 in the next two years. This means the situation will only get worse if the government cannot find additional sources to pay for the increasing demand for ARV treatment. Duong said that the Ministry of Health proposed some measures to the State to help deal with the funding crisis. The States allocation of ARV funds to localities would depend on how much need they demonstrate, he said. If a province or city can rebalance their funds to loosen up some more funds for ARV, they must do so and expect a little less support than last year. The State would prioritise using this years tight ARV funds to support poor and remote localities first. Provinces and cities were told to instruct locals living with HIV/AIDS to buy health insurance so that insurance can pay for some of their treatment expenses. On the VAAC website, the agency suggested the State to set up a nationwide order for the drug and then deliver to different provinces and cities since buying the drug in bulk reduces the price. â€” VNS",Society,"['arvs', 'funds', 'state', 'arv', 'lacking', 'nam', 'hiv', 'living', 'hivaids', 'medicine', 'viet', 'demand', 'support']","The Government of Viet Nam first allowed ARV medicines into the country in 2000 but they only became widely used in 2007.

Ä�am said that without drastic measures, tackling synthetic drugs and growing drug addiction would be challenges. The Health Ministry has set up treatment guidelines. Sectors and localities must promote communication through video clips and programmes to warn people about the risks of synthetic drugs. Ä�am said that local leaders must change attitudes towards drug treatment. The purpose of drug rehabilitation efforts, he said, is not to â€œpurifyâ€� an area but to ensure addicted people can return to their communities and receive appropriate treatment as social order is maintained. Ä�am urged localities to sustain the use of methadone in treating drug addiction. He said that there were 408 locations nationwide where prostitutes were known to work. He ordered the provinces and cities to implement projects to reduce the number to 200 by the end of next year.

City should ensure insurance coverage,"HCM City health centres that provide treatment to patients with HIV/AIDS should merge by the end of the year with district-level hospitals if the centres are unable to expand services to upgrade into general health clinics, which offer various kinds of treatment to all patients, a city official has said.",[],2017-09-09,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€“ HCM City health centres that provide treatment to patients with HIV/AIDS should merge by the end of the year with district-level hospitals if the centres are unable to expand services to upgrade into general health clinics, which offer various kinds of treatment to all patients, a city official has said. Twenty-one of the cityâ€™s 24 health centres (formerly known as preventive health centres) offer treatment for HIV/AIDS patients and preventive health services. Many of these centres, however, have not signed contracts with the Viá»‡t Nam Social Security agency, and thus, patients with HIV/AIDS, even those with health insurance cards, cannot be insured. Dr TiÃªu Thá»‹ Thu VÃ¢n, head of the cityâ€™s Centre for HIV/AIDS Prevention, at a meeting between the department and its health centres held this week, said that the centres which lack conditions to upgrade to a general health clinic should merge with district-level hospitals to ensure continuity of treatment for HIV/AIDS patients as well as health insurance coverage. â€œIf patients with HIV/AIDS stop using anti-retroviral (ARV) medicine for one week, they will become resistant to the medicine, leading to a problem of epidemic control in the city,â€� VÃ¢n said. The cost for treatment for patients who are resistant to the drug would not be covered by insurance, VÃ¢n said, adding that the cost is five to 10 times higher than the usual treatment given before drug-resistance. International aid to Viá»‡t Nam that covers the costs of ARV drugs is gradually being reduced and will completely end by 2020, VÃ¢n said. At the beginning of the year, state insurance funds will start covering costs for ARV drugs. If health centres are able to upgrade to general clinics, they could then sign contracts for insured examinations and drug treatment with the Viá»‡t Nam Social Security agency.

KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a faces dearth of HIV health workers,Health authorities in Nha Trang City â€“ the famous beach tourism destination hit hard by HIV/AIDS â€“ have made progress against the epidemic. But their efforts are threatened by a lack of adequate human resources.,[],2017-09-14,vietnamnews.vn,"KHÃ�NH HÃ’A â€“ Health authorities in Nha Trang City â€“ the famous beach tourism destination hit hard by HIV/AIDS â€“ have made progress against the epidemic. However, their efforts are threatened by a lack of adequate human resources. The first HIV/AIDS patient in KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a Province, where Nha Trang is located, was discovered in 1993, three years after Viá»‡t Nam detected its first HIV/AIDS patient. KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a Province used to rank in the top 10 provinces for number of HIV-infected people. In the 2002-03 period, it ranked as high as the second most-infected, following HCM City. But since 2012, it hasnâ€™t made the list, said Dr Tráº§n VÄƒn TÃ­n, director of the provinceâ€™s HIVAIDS Prevention Centre. Doctors believe that in recent years, both the number of new HIV infections and deaths has declined. Furthermore, the number of HIV-infected people being treated has increased so that 76 per cent of all people with HIV are being treated at provincial health centres and hospitals. But the prevention work faces many challenges, especially lack of human resources for HIVAIDS prevention. There arenâ€™t enough health staff, doctors and social workers, according to Dr Tráº§n VÄƒn TÃ­n. Only two doctors at the provincial HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre are now in charge of treating 350 people with HIV by methadone, and another 100 others with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. In terms of funding for HIVAIDS prevention work, Dr TÃ­n said that in the past, the province had received about VNÄ�11 billion from various foreign and domestic organizations ever year. But recently, only VNÄ�2.4 billion from the provincial budget has been spent on health sector every year. And since 2016, there has been no funding for human resources training and development. The HIV prevention work was extremely difficult, and the pressure to make progress was great, the director said. The lack of adequately trained doctors, nurses and other health professionals required everyone to stretch themselves thin on the job. â€œI am in charge of both managing and directly treating patients, even preparing medical file and editing text,â€� said TÃ­n. In KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a â€“ a province thriving in all aspects and operating with a market economy ---- many doctors were happy to leave the district-level health centres when they found other jobs with higher incomes. This made it difficult for the HIV/AIDS centres to retain employees. The brain drain is a common situation not only in the province, but also in localities across the country. At the centre, if one or two doctors took a day off, hundreds of prescriptions and patient files piled up and awaited their return. In the past five years, TÃ­n said, he has sent requests many times to the provincial Department of Health to recruit more doctors and health staff. While every year, hundreds of doctors submitted applications to KhÃ¡nh HÃ²aâ€™s hospitals, no doctor has been sent to the centre. â€œThere has been great pressure for many years, the Department of Health has called, but still not recruited doctors for the HIV centre,â€� he said. â€œBecause no one wants to do HIV.â€� LÃ¢m Quang Chá»©ng, deputy director of the KhÃ¡nh HÃ²a Provinceâ€™s Department of Health, said it knew the situation of the doctor shortage in HIV centre. Not only the HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, but also departments of dermatology, tuberculosis, forensics, and psychiatry have been dealing with doctor shortages, Chá»©ng said. He stressed that after the implementation of the Governmentâ€™s policy on attracting human resources to rural areas, the provincial health sector was building a proposal for a long-term health worker development strategy. â€” VNS",Society,"['provincial', 'province', 'doctors', 'hÃ²a', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'prevention', 'human', 'faces', 'dearth', 'khÃ¡nh', 'workers', 'health']","KHÃ�NH HÃ’A â€“ Health authorities in Nha Trang City â€“ the famous beach tourism destination hit hard by HIV/AIDS â€“ have made progress against the epidemic.

Treatments empower HIV-positive mothers,"Standing on the threshold of her unfinished house, 32-year-old Nguyen Thi Luong lit up with joy thinking about her coming baby.",[],2013-12-24,vietnamnews.vn,"A woman living with HIV has an ultrasound. Social organisations are standing up for the reproductive rights of women living with HIV. â€” Photo courtesy of UNAIDS. by Nguyen Ngoc THAI NGUYEN (VNS) â€” Standing on the threshold of her unfinished house, 32-year-old Nguyen Thi Luong lit up with joy thinking about her coming baby. Three years ago, the thin woman from northern Thai Nguyen Provinces Dai Tu District never thought she would be so happy. That year, Luong lost her husband and first child to HIV/AIDS and found out she too was infected with the virus. But with the support of her friends and continued counseling, as well as the help of the local branch of Hoa Huong Duong (Sun Flower) Club, an organisation that provides care and support to people living with HIV/AIDS, Luong eventually gained back her sense of self. When she joined the club of 100 HIV-infected membersâ€” 83 of whom were womenâ€”Luong found that having HIV did not mean her life was over. Through monthly discussions, Luong learned about how to deal with her condition. However, the club sessions did not address her primary longing: a baby. Last year, after much counseling, Luong and her new partner decided to go through with a pregnancy. ""Nobody supports our decision. Neighbours and relatives, even my sister, believed that I would transmit the deadly virus to my baby and it would be a burden to society after I died,"" Luong said. However, Luong is now four months pregnant and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ARV). She strongly believes that her baby will be born without the virus. ""My partner and I are building our house and preparing everything to welcome our baby,"" Luong said. Another woman from Ha Thuong Commune, 33-year-old Tran Thi Thu, has the same desire as Luong but failed twice to become a mother. Her five-year-old daughter died of the disease five years ago; her son followed, only one hour after coming into the world. ""I participate in several projects for HIV, which makes me busy the whole day. But after work, Im a lonely woman in the cold house where I so longed to have a child,"" Thu said. She expressed determination to try to have another baby next year. ""Even living with HIV, a woman still deserves to have her own baby,"" Thu said. ""As long as you are optimistic, I strongly believe that God will not let you down whether you are a healthy person or an HIV sufferer."" Luong and Thus desire to have a baby is common among HIV-infected women in the district, according to Dinh Thi Xuan, head of Hoa Huong Duong club. ""All female HIV carriers in the club talk about their burning desire to have children,"" she said. Xuan added that three members of the club have children who tested negative for HIV. This encouraged other women not to give up hope of having healthy children. ""I will also have a baby when my financial state is better,"" Xuan confided. Without preventive intervention, between 20 and 45 per cent of infants born to HIV-positive mothers contract HIV through mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The proportion can be reduced to less than 10 per cent through a combination of prevention measures, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the expectant mother and her newborn child, hygienic delivery conditions and safe infant feeding. Thai Nguyen ranks fourth out of ten provinces nationwide with the highest number of HIV cases, according to the provincial department of health. Over 9,000 HIV cases have been reported throughout the province, 19 per cent of them women. The risk of mother-to-child transmission reported in the province last year was six per cent, said vice director of the provinces HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre Truong Binh Minh. ""Motherhood is stipulated to be the legal right of women following the Viet Nam Population Ordinance so nobody can prevent HIV-positive women from having children,"" he said. However, Minh recommended those women ask for counselors advice before having children during pregnancy and after delivery. In addition, they should take account of factors that affect a womans ability to bring up the child such as financial condition, job and support from relatives. ""Scientists have not found any drugs to eradicate HIV/AIDS, so both HIV-positive women and their children face the risk of mother-to-child transmission. Thus, the government should pay attention to the fact that HIV women are choosing to have children,"" Minh said. The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) officially states that parents living with HIV have their sexual reproductive rights protected and can have HIV-free babies. ""All women have the right to choice when it comes to exercising their sexual and reproductive health and rights and protecting themselves from risk of HIV infection,"" said UNAIDS Deputy Executive Director, Management and Governance, Jan Beagle. ""AIDS is much more than a health issue, it is a development issue, a rights issue, and it is clear that gender equality and human rights are non-negotiable elements to ensure effective HIV and health responses as well as social justice for all."" In a recent UNAIDS survey, women living with HIV expressed concern about the advice given by many health workers and authorities to avoid having children. They also complained that they lacked information about how to have a safe pregnancy and deliver an HIV-negative child. ""People living with HIV aim to live in a world that protects their sexual and reproductive rights,"" the survey concluded. The authors added that this required training health providers to teach HIV-positive individuals considering becoming pregnant about safe conception methods as well as changes in regulations to improve access to fertility procedures that reduced the risk of passing on the virus. â€” VNS",Society,"['woman', 'baby', 'women', 'living', 'hiv', 'nguyen', 'rights', 'hivpositive', 'treatments', 'empower', 'luong', 'children', 'mothers', 'health']","A woman living with HIV has an ultrasound.

Hepatitis C patients find treatment too expensive,A former intravenous drug user in HCM City had the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for many years but did not know about it.,[],2018-12-19,vietnamnews.vn,"Gia Lá»™c HCM CITYâ€” A former intravenous drug user in HCM City had the hepatitis C virus (HCV) for many years but did not know about it. Through a pilot project for raising HCV awareness among high-risk populations in the city and screening for the disease, she recently came to know about her status. But she said in tears, â€œI cannot get treatment because I cannot afford the medicines.â€� The medicines alone cost VNÄ�7.5-15 million (US$322- $644) a month, whether at private or public hospitals. Dr VÅ© Ngá»�c Báº£o, deputy programme director of HIV/TB at PATH, a global NGO, said high-risk populations cannot afford HCV screening, diagnosis and treatment costs. According to Nguyá»…n Ä�Äƒng Táº¥n Lá»™c, an HCV and HIV counsellor at Galant Clinic, the demand for HCV testing among the clinicâ€™s patients is high, and when they find out they are infected, they face high treatment costs. â€œEven if health insurance covers 50 per cent of the treatment costs, many of them cannot afford the rest because their incomes are too low.â€� At his clinic, HCV patients could pay in instalments for their treatment, he added. Dr TiÃªu Thá»‹ Thu VÃ¢n, director of the HCM City HIV/ADIS Prevention Centre, called on pharmaceutical companies to reduce drug prices. Many people at high risk of contracting HCV in the country are also those who are at increased risk of HIV, including people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men (MSM), according to a press release from PATH. PATH works to accelerate health equity by bringing together public institutions, businesses, social enterprises, and investors to solve the worldâ€™s most pressing health challenges. HCV is an infectious disease that can result in serious liver damage and death. Many people with HCV have no symptoms until long-term infection gives way to these serious consequences. The virus spreads through the blood of an infected person. Up to 4 per cent of the Vietnamese population has evidence of exposure to HCV, with many developing long-term infection. Since January 2018 PATH, the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Centre, Gilead Sciences, and private clinics and community-based organisations (CBOs) in the city have collaborated for a new approach to increase awareness and expand access to HCV testing among those most at risk of infection. It built on the platform developed by USAID/PATH Healthy Markets and the Viá»‡t Nam Administration for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC) to increase access to HIV services for key populations by integrating HCV information and services into established community-based services and communication channels. â€œThe introduction of community-based testing for HIV in Viá»‡t Nam provides a strong platform and timely opportunity for also increasing awareness and uptake of HCV testing among [high-risk] groups,â€� VÃ¢n said. An assessment done by the project found that most people at risk of HCV did not know about the risks and consequences of HCV, where to go for screening, diagnosis and treatment or how to prevent HCV. In response, PATH, HCMC PAC, Gilead, private clinics, and CBOs worked together to develop educational and behavioural changes and a demand creation campaign called â€˜Healthy Liver, Happy Lifeâ€™. This campaign mobilised social media networks, community-led offline events, and in-clinic counselling (integrated into counseling for HIV testing and other HIV-related services) to raise awareness of HCV and encourage people to engage in HCV testing. Concerns about discrimination at testing facilities were also barriers to testing and so this project leveraged USAID/PATH Healthy Markets and the VAACâ€™s experience in introducing community-based HIV testing to reach those most at risk of HCV. Studies conducted by USAID/PATH Healthy Markets found that PWID (people who inject drugs) and MSM lay health workers (CBO staff and peers) in the city were just as skilled as trained healthcare workers in delivering HIV tests and significantly more likely to reach new HIV testers. Those testing at PWID and MSM-led CBOs and clinics are also more likely to be HIV positive than those testing at public facilities since many of them prefer to receive services from people they know and trust. Following these lessons, this pilot project enabled HIV positive and negative and PWID and MSM groups to access quick and easy HCV testing through community-led private clinics and CBOs, often at the same time as testing for HIV. Trained staff offered rapid diagnostic tests that require a small amount of blood from the prick of a finger. The process is simple, safe, and painless. If the test was positive, people were assisted with confirmatory diagnosis and treatment. Since April this year 3,116 people have undergone HCV testing. As many as 217 received a reactive result with the rapid test, and 111 were subsequently diagnosed with HCV and linked to further medical care. â€œThe path to eliminating hepatitis C starts with awareness, screening and diagnosis,â€� Boon-Leong Neo, senior director, public health & medical affairs, at Gilead Sciences, said. The clinics involved in this pilot will continue to provide integrated HIV and HCV counselling, screening and linkages to care.

A conference of the Standing Board of the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Prevention to review work so far this year and set tasks for the remaining months on Tuesday heard that the country recorded some positive achievements during the period but many challenges remained. These challenges included the number of drug addicts in methadone treatment falling short of Government targets, slow renovation of drug detoxification, an increase in methamphetamine trafficking and use and a rising number of drug addicts. Communication works on HIV/AIDS, drugs and prostitution prevention and control remain limited and shortcomings still exist in regulations, heard the conference. To help tackle these difficulties, the Deputy PM asked the Ministry of Public Security to submit the 2016-2020 programme on drug prevention to the Government and help other agencies amend the Law on Drug Prevention and Control. The ministry was also urged to collaborate with the Ministry of Defence to tackle drugs in border areas. As Chairman of the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Prevention, Ä�am requested the Ministry of Health guide the use of methadone for drug addiction treatment and establish antiretroviral treatment management systems. The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs was asked to improve prostitution prevention while the Ministry of Justice will consider an administrative punishment on drug users. The Deputy PM instructed local peopleâ€™s committees to mobilise resources from the community for the fight against AIDS, drugs and prostitution, and link the work with socio-economic development.

This was revealed by health officials yesterday at the stakeholder consultation on the upcoming high-level meeting on ending AIDS. Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, head of the health ministryâ€™s Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, said a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the National Committee for AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution Prevention and Control VÅ© Ä�á»©c Ä�am would attend the high-level meeting, organised by the United Nations, next month. Calling for international assistance would be one of the key messages Viá»‡t Namâ€™s delegation intends to deliver at the UN meeting, he said. Other messages include Viá»‡t Namâ€™s progress in HIV/AIDS control, the challenges it has faced in fighting the disease and the countryâ€™s appreciation of international support. Long said the deputy PM was especially interested in bringing the voice of the people living with HIV/AIDS to the worldâ€™s notice. The AIDS department and UNAIDS in Viá»‡t Nam have organised four consultation workshops to gather opinions that may help enhance Viá»‡t Namâ€™s contributions to the meeting. The fourth consultation yesterday focused on the need to strengthen access to services for people living with HIV/AIDS and for vulnerable groups, the demand for an improved legal framework and the need to secure the sufferersâ€™ human rights. Co-operation with non-State partners was also discussed. According to the AIDS department, Viá»‡t Nam has made great strides in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. For example, the number of newly infected people each year dropped from 18,000 in 2010 to some 10,000 in 2015. The death toll fell from 3,200 people in 2010 to some 2,000 people in 2015. Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is said to be on the decline. However, major challenges remain, including the increasing number of women being infected and reduced financial support from international donors. In 2014, the country announced its commitment to set new targets intended to rapidly expand HIV treatment, making it the first Asian country to adopt the 90â€“90â€“90 target. This means that 90 per cent of people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of people who know their status will be on HIV treatment; and 90 per cent of all people on treatment will achieve undetectable levels of HIV in their body (known as viral suppression). Around the world, momentum is building behind reaching this target by 2020. Viet Namâ€™s commitment to this ambitious target puts the country on course to ending its AIDS epidemic by 2030. â€” VNS",Society,"['treatment', 'international', 'viá»‡t', 'vn', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'avoid', 'prevention', 'aids', 'nams', 'control', 'seeks', 'assistance', 'resurgence']","HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” Viá»‡t Nam is seeking international assistance with HIV/AIDS prevention and control to avoid a resurgence of the disease.

Recording the song has been one of my most meaningful projects."" It was not easy to gather all 20 singers to record the song, but thanks to the Musical Achievement Prize Awards Ceremony that took place in Ha Noi at the beginning of May, where almost every major Vietnamese singer was present, Tuan had a chance to gather the selected singers to record the song.

HIV prevention targets pregnant women,"Sitting alone on a bench outside the Obstetrics Department of Thot Not District General Hospital in southern Can Tho City, the round and sun-bronzed face of a young woman betrays a gnawing anxiety.

Pre-natal consultancy is important for women living with HIV to prevent mother-to-child transmissions. â€” VNS Photo Thu Hien CAN THO ( CAN THO ( VNS )â€” Sitting alone on a bench outside the Obstetrics Department of Thot Not District General Hospital in southern Can Tho City, the round and sun-bronzed face of a young woman betrays a gnawing anxiety. Her eyes sometimes flit down to her soil-filled finger nails which cling tightly to the bench. Her threadbare hat tumbles to the floor but she does not care about picking it up. She seems to be on the brink of a life-changing event. As department deputy head Nguyen Ngoc Diem Uyens door opens, the woman rushes towards it. Dr Uyen hands her a result paper and says: ""The results of the HIV PCR test show that despite being exposed to HIV, your baby has not contracted the disease. Go home and celebrate this huge slice of luck."" The troubled woman, 27-year-old Nguyen Le Chin (not her real name), is one of more than 12,760 pregnant females in the city who have been tested for HIV this year. Furthermore, she is one of the 24 unfortunate women found to be HIV positive by these tests. Fortunately, she was provided with expert consultancy and treatment to prevent the virus from being transmitted to her unborn child. Lai Kim Anh, director of the citys HIV/AIDS Combat and Prevention Centre says these tested cases account for more than 85 per cent of total pregnancies in Can Tho City this year. The mother-to-child transmission prevention project, which started in the city four years ago, has reduced instances of mother-to-child HIV transmission to zero this year, down from nearly 12 per cent in 2008. Meanwhile, the national target programme has set a goal of bringing mother-to-child transmissions under the 5 per cent mark by 2015, she says. If this prevention process was only implemented in obstetrics hospitals, it would be useless, she says. It needs to include early HIV tests at commune-level healthcare clinics, while pregnant women must receive regular health checks and vaccinations. Chins story Having pottered about the paddy fields tending ducks since she was small, Chin had never gone to school or even left her village. When she was 24 years old, she was introduced to a man and told that he would become her husband. ""I did not have any feelings for him. I merely accepted because the matchmaker told me he was kind and trustful."" Chin soon fell pregant, but it took the young girl three months to realise. She says during her first pregnancy check, the doctor at her communes health clinic extracted some of her blood to detect whether she had any serious diseases. ""At that time, I laughed because I was so strong that no disease could possibly exist in my body."" However, one week later, she was asked to come back by the doctor and was then told she had contracted HIV. He instructed her to go to the districts general hospital for more checks and a consultancy next day. ""I did not know what HIV was but one person in my village had died of it. So, I knew it must be a terrible killer and feared that my foetus would suffer the same fate as me. I was also scared that I would transmit the virus to others if I had any interaction with them."" Chin was deeply saddened but shed no tears. ""It seems a life with paddy fields and ducks has made me unable to express my feelings."" She kept quiet about her disease because people in her village and family were scared of the virus. She wandered around the field for a whole day and agonised about whether to have an abortion. But everything changed for the better when she met Dr Uyen at the district hospital and she was soon undergoing treatment. Dr Uyen says like other pregnant women who are HIV positive, Chin was asked to take AZT (also called Zidovudine or ZDV), a kind of anti-retroviral medicine taken at 14 to 34 weeks of pregnancy, to lower her viral load (the amount of HIV in her blood). ""When her viral load is very low, it is less likely that she will pass HIV to her baby, so this is her best chance."" Dr Uyen was Chins only companion during her hour of need. Even her husband, the only person she told about the disease, failed to show any care. ""He coldly told me that the worst consequence was death, so there was nothing to worry about and that he was too busy to visit me,"" she said. Chin asked him several times to take a HIV test but ""he refused and said he did not believe doctors, their stupid drugs and even the disease they were talking about."" ""He acted as if it was nothing to do with him. I have spent my life in the fields with ducks, so there is no way I could contract this disease. It is him that brought this terrible affliction to me."" Lucky baby When she was going into labour, Chin also got some ARVs to reduce the risk of infecting her baby during the process. Chins baby was born weighing 2.9kg and received special safety and hygiene measures for the first four weeks of her life to counteract exposure to the virus during labour. She is growing up as all babies do and receives regular health checks. She will also be provided with free milk until she is 18-month-old - babies can be infected through breastfeeding so Chin was asked to bottle feed her baby only. And much to Chins relief, the four-week-old baby has undergone a HIV PCR test indicating she is free of the virus. Dr Uyen says: ""The PCR test is very important. It can tell to 98 per cent certainty whether or not a baby who is HIV-exposed has contracted HIV."" Chins baby is a lucky case as she was treated from an early stage. According to Bui Duc Duong, deputy director of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, in many localities, the number of pregnant women getting HIV tests and consultancy falls between just 6-30 per cent of total pregnancies. The statistics show that without proper treatment, the risk of a baby contracting HIV from their infected mother is between 35-40 per cent. This means more than 1,820 babies will contract HIV every year in Viet Nam. Meanwhile, Chin is looking forward to when her child is 18 months old and will undergo the second test which tells with certainty whether her baby is in the clear. Chin is still using ARVs as usual and suffers no side-effects. When she suffers headaches or sickness, Dr Uyen is always her first port of call. Now, despite earning just VND60,000 (US$2.5) each day, Chin has started saving money for when her daughter goes to school. She holds a strong belief that she will live as long as HIV-free people so long as she uses ARVs according to the doctors advice. ""Like ducks, which have to wade through water to follow their flocks although they are sick, I and my child can survive in spite of our difficulties."" â€” VNS",Sunday,"['targets', 'baby', 'told', 'women', 'hiv', 'disease', 'chin', 'test', 'prevention', 'cent', 'uyen', 'pregnant']","Pre-natal consultancy is important for women living with HIV to prevent mother-to-child transmissions.

Combined treatment lifts TB/HIV patient burdens,"A pilot programme of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to combine tuberculosis and HIV treatments for TB/HIV co-infected patients in medical centres at district and commune levels have yielded positive results, experts said.",[],2017-06-21,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€“ A Ministry of Health (MoH) pilot programme to combine tuberculosis and HIV treatments for TB/HIV co-infected patients in medical centres at district and commune levels has yielded positive results, experts said. The programme was first implemented from 2013 to 2015 in Nho Quan District (Ninh BÃ¬nh Province) and HÆ°ng HÃ  District (ThÃ¡i BÃ¬nh Province). It was then expanded to 12 provinces in 2015-2016. The programme aims to reduce the burdens for TB/HIV co-infected patients, caused by separated treatment systems for the two diseases which are common at most medical establishments in the country. According to Associate Professor BÃ¹i Ä�á»©c DÆ°Æ¡ng, deputy director of MoHâ€™s Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, TB is the most common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients and is thus the leading cause of HIV death. Every year, Viá»‡t Nam has about 5,500 new cases of TB/HIV co-infected patients. However, an absence of a combined TB/HIV treatment system has forced many patients to go back and forth between different medical establishments at the same time for diagnosis and treatment. For example, a TB-infected patient will be introduced to a HIV/AIDS-treated centre for test and possible treatment (in case they are HIV positive). On the contrary, a HIV/AIDS patient who is suspicious of having TB will be advised to go to a TB-treated centre. Many patients, already feeling disgraced and hopeless about their situation, end up quitting the treatment process due to exhaustion. The pilot programme has solved this problem, said Dr Nguyá»…n VÄƒn Cá»­ of Central Lung Hospital. According to the preliminary results from the 12 provinces implementing the pilot programme, the proactive detection of tuberculosis infection in HIV patients as well as the detection of HIV infection in TB patients has markedly improved. Now, patients can be diagnosed for both infections the first time they go to a medical centre, instead of at least three times as before. The programme has also increased the number of TB and HIV/AIDS co-infected patients simultaneously receiving treatment for both diseases. â€œThe number of patients quitting treatment process has reduced, while doctors are informed of both TB-treatment and HIV-treatment processes,â€� Cá»­ said. The combined model has also helped reduce medical personnel, facility cost and other investment costs needed to offer TB and HIV/AIDS treatment services, said Assoc Prof and Dr LÃª VÄƒn Há»£i, deputy director of Central Lung Hospital. Besides, the quality of medical services has improved, especially in disease detection and early treatment. Due to the effectiveness of the model, the Ministry of Health is ready to expand the programme to a national scale over the next few years, according to Há»£i.

Holding her 14 month-old niece Ngoc Huyen in her arms, Huong wipes away tears. ""She was diagnosed as being infected by HIV only last week, and has been ill since then,"" she says, as the infant shudders and cries convulsively. Huyenâ€™s father had been working far from home, and had sexual relations with other women while he was away. He was later diagnosed as having HIV/AIDS. Chief nurse of the Central Paediatric Hospitalâ€™s Infectious Diseases wing, Nguyen Thi Bich Nhat, says nearly 100 children afflicted with HIV/AIDS have been admitted to the hospital for treatment this year, many in critical condition suffering from respiratory failure. Many of the children were being cared for by their grandparents, because their parents had already died from illnesses related to HIV/AIDS. Last month two more children died at the hospital, she said. Baby Huyen is now receiving treatment as an inpatient, suffering from severe pneumonia. The Central Obstetric and Gynaecology Hospital is seeing more and more infected babies whose lives will be counted in days. Nurse Nguyen Thi Hoa holds a new born. ""Poor child. Her mother was hospitalised with ulcers covering her whole body. After giving birth, she was rushed home to die without seeing her daughter."" Hoa says the family have not returned to the hospital or phoned about the baby. ""I am not sure if they will come back to pick her up,"" she says. Another infected baby receiving treatment at the hospital has not yet seen her parents. Her mother is infected with HIV/AIDS. ""I do not know if her family is somehow afraid of catching the disease or are discouraged, but they have abandoned the baby to be cared for by our nurses and doctors ,"" Hoa says. Doctor Pham Van Mai, head of paediatrics at the hospital, says the number of infected children admitted this year was higher than in the previous year. His wing received 67 new born babies infected with HIV from their mothers. He says in the past, babies were usually infected by intravenous-drug-using fathers or mothers who were sex workers. However, he says, now they are finding some parents are civil servants or from other backgrounds. One of three infected children receiving treatment at the hospital is the daughter of an accountant and an engineer. Since their daughter was found to have been infected from her mother, the father has been severely depressed. He is too scared to bring their other children for a HIV test, and says he would commit suicide if another child was also found to be infected. His wifeâ€™s infection is developing into full-blown AIDS. Health workers at the hospital say they werenâ€™t sure if this man was busy taking care of his wife, but that he has not yet come back to collect their daughter. As the number of children infected with HIV/AIDS increases, paediatric healthcare workers are getting busier. Nurses immediately bathe new borns, hoping the quick cleansing of lochia will prevent HIV infection.

The supply of ARV drugs funded by international donors is expected to be used up by the end of next year, said Nguyá»…n Há»¯u HÆ°ng, deputy director of the cityâ€™s Department of Health. Health insurance will have to cover the cost of ARV drugs starting in early 2019, HÆ°ng said at a conference held on Wednesday in HCM City. The cityâ€™s Department of Health has told medical centres in all districts to establish general clinics to provide health examinations and treatment for insured HIV patients. However, medical centres in several districts are ineligible to establish general clinics because of a lack of specialised doctors and medical equipment. Pháº¡m Thá»‹ Kim Hoa, director of Cáº§n Giá»� Districtâ€™s Medical Centre, said that its public health consulting and support department had long been responsible for providing free health check-ups and treatment for HIV patients. The public health consulting and support department, however, is not eligible to sign contracts with social insurance agencies to provide health check-ups and treatment for insured HIV patients. Therefore, the centre has to set up a general clinic which has legal rights to sign contracts with social insurance agencies, according to Hoa. The centre said it had sought approval for setting up a general clinic, but it was refused because of it lacked specialised doctors, she said. It plans to transfer treatment of 112 patients to Cáº§n Giá»� Hospital by the second quarter of next year. District 1â€™s Medical Centre is in the same situation as it is struggling to set up a general clinic to provide health care services for HIV patients with insurance cards, said Nguyá»…n VÄƒn Thá»ƒ, director of the centre.

New research points to possible cure and end of AIDS epidemic by 2030,"New research in the treatment of AIDS has pointed to a possible cure, which could lead to the UNâ€™s goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030.",[],2016-10-22,vietnamnews.vn,"Gia Lá»™c CHICAGO â€” New research in the treatment of AIDS has pointed to a possible cure, which could lead to the UNâ€™s goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. Research in human immunology, genomics, virology and structural biology has raised expectations for a successful vaccine strategy that could be an effective cure. Results of the research are being discussed at the biennial HIV Research for Prevention (HIVR4P) conference in Chicago from October 17-21. More than 1,400 delegates from 41 countries are attending the event. According to USAID, the AIDS pandemic continues to be a major global health issue. Although treatment rates have doubled in the past five years, the number of annual new infections with HIV has not decreased substantially. In 2015, HIV infected more than two million people and killed more than one million around the world. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most severely affected with 25 million adults and children living with HIV. Recent modeling results show that even in the face of the massively expanded use of current treatment and prevention options, hundreds of thousands of people in low- and middle-income countries will be newly infected with HIV and die from AIDS for decades to come. Given the scope of the epidemic, new biomedical tools to prevent HIV are essential, according to USAID. An effective, well-adopted vaccine could prevent the majority of new annual HIV infections, thereby averting millions of infections and savings countless lives. Professor Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina in the US, said the next 15 years would provide the field with opportunities for developing an array of HIV prevention tools, including the possible use of antibodies for HIV prevention, and the development of HIV vaccines based on an understanding of the mechanisms of action of the antibodies. HIV prevention research is â€œon the moveâ€�, Cohen said, adding that ongoing studies would inform implementation of treatment for prevention and maximise benefits. â€œLong-acting antiviral agents will serve as critical new tools for treatment and prevention of HIV,â€� he said, adding that ultimately new tools will lead to improve combination prevention of HIV. HIVR4P co-chair Lynn Morris of South Africaâ€™s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said: â€œVaccine research is embarking on two large clinical trials to test the ability of different types of antibodies to prevent HIV infection.â€� â€œWe also have a vigorous pipeline of new vaccine concepts and products, along with a more focused plan for getting them tested in humans much more quickly than ever before,â€� she added. Another HIVR4P co-chair, Nelly Mugo of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, said that a global movement to crush the epidemic in women and girls required looking at HIV prevention technologies, implementation and behaviour issues together. â€œToday we have new options in female-controlled HIV prevention such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and, perhaps soon, (dapivirine vaginal) rings. One of our biggest remaining challenges, and one that we expect to hear a lot about at the conference, is understanding how to make these new tools available to women and girls, and how to support them to use these tools and stay safe.â€� Jeanne Marrazzo of the University of Alabama in Birmingham (US), who is also one of the HIVR4P co-chairs, said the field was realising that choice and flexibility were key to HIV prevention and to new options that can enhance both reproductive health and HIV and sexually transmitted infection prevention. â€œIncreasing access and adherence is also dependent on engaging potential users early and often, as new prevention products are developed and tested, to better understanding and address what they want and need to remain HIV-free,â€� she said. Another HIVR4P co-chair, Thomas Hope of Northwestern University (US), said the conference supported collaboration and partnerships between researchers, advocates, scientists and policymakers focusing on vaccines, microbicides and other forms of prevention. Such collaboration could lead to better, faster and more comprehensive responses to the epidemic, he said. Interventions for adolescents Dr Chewe Luo, associate director and programme division chief of HIV/AIDS Section at UNICEF, said that new HIV infections had declined rapidly among children aged zero to 14, but more slowly among adolescents aged 15 to 19 and young adults aged 20 to 24. According to analysis of UNAIDS 2015 HIV and AIDS released in June, it was estimated that 1.8 million adolescents were living with HIV globally, including 80 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa. â€œWe have to need improve targeting and planning for effective combinations of prevention packages,â€� she said. Ending AIDS in adolescents is an important contribution to ending AIDS by 2030 and ensuring broader sustainable development goals of ensuring health and well-being for all, at every stage of life, she said. A differentiated and targeted approach is required for adolescents, and service packages must be cross-sectorial for adolescents, she added. For instance, a combination HIV-prevention package for people who inject drugs includes HIV-test services and antiretroviral therapy; a condom lubricant programme; information on communication, empowerment, laws and rights of people who inject drugs; and clinical services, opoid-substitution therapy and needle-syringe exchange programmes. This package is part of the UNAIDSâ€™s fast-tracking combination prevention toward reducing new HIV infections to fewer than 500.000 by 2020. Moreover, technology should be used in HIV intervention with adolescents, she said. For example, the U-report, an interactive mobile phone and SMS-based programme, has been used to provide confidential counselling via SMS and chatting with adolescents in Zambia. Currently, there are 2.1 million U-Reporters across the globe. â€œWe know that smarter investments targeted at biomedical, behavioural and structural interventions will decrease the number of new infections,â€� she said. Susan Rosenthal of Columbia University (US) said that those who provide HIV intervention and other services to adolescents should have a better understanding of the implications of psychological development and decision-making. Additional time should be built into clinic scheduling for counseling, she said. More funds needed A new report released at the second HIV Research for Prevention Conference documented 2015 funding, highlighting a decade of flat funding and its potential impact on continued innovation in the HIV-prevention research and development (R&D) field. The Resource Tracking for HIV Prevention R&D Working Groupâ€™s 12th annual report with the title of HIV Prevention Research & Development Investments, and 2000-2015 Investment priorities to fund innovation in a challenging global health landscape, finds that funding for R&D of new and emerging prevention options decreased slightly in 2015. This was due in part to decreases from the US public sector and a downswing in global philanthropic funding. In 2015, funders invested a total of US $1.20 billion across R&D, down from US $1.25 billion in 2014, across eight key areas: preventive AIDS vaccines, microbicides, PrEP using antiretroviral drugs, treatment as prevention, Herpes simplex virus type 2 vaccines and operations research related to voluntary medical male circumcision, female condoms and prevention of vertical transmission. Steady progress in R&D for AIDS vaccines, microbicides, PrEP using antiretroviral drugs and treatment as prevention confirms scienceâ€™s critical role in providing solutions to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Yet research for these badly needed solutions is in danger of being slowed or even sidelined by inadequate funding, according to a press release issued at the conference on September 19. Luiz Loures, deputy executive director of UNAIDS, said that it was critical to scale up investments in HIV-prevention innovations, science and technology â€œto put us on the Fast-Track to ending AIDS by 2030â€�. The report also finds that investment is being made in all phases of the research pipeline but remains concentrated among a few large investors. The US public sector (primarily via the National Institutes of Health) remained the largest global contributor at US$850 million, accounting for 70 per cent of total funding. The US government and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest philanthropic funder, accounted for 81 per cent of all funding in 2015. A more diverse base of funders would increase the stability of R&D financing and cushion the impact if any of the major funders were to reduce their investments. To improve continuity, the Resource Tracking for HIV Prevention R&D Working Group calls for a more balanced funding base, especially through support of new investment by European and low- and middle-income countries. Mark Feinberg, president and CEO of International ADIS Vaccine Initiative, said there was strong momentum in research and development, and â€œwe need to expedite the development of vaccine strategies and other new, biomedical prevention options that promise to be safe, accessible and effective for use throughout the worldâ€�. â€œThere must be adequate and sustained investment at all stages from early laboratory research and to clinical testing if we are to truly be able to contain the HIV pandemic and approach an end to AIDS,â€� he added. There is great optimism for HIV prevention research. Daily oral PrEP is gaining traction as a new prevention option in an increasing number of countries. An antiretroviral-based microbicide ring that showed modest efficacy earlier in 2016 will be further evaluated to determine its viability as a prevention option for women, and large-scale efficacy trials of an AIDS vaccine candidate and an injectable form of PrEP are slated to begin soon. In addition, a novel proof-of-concept trial of antibody-mediated prevention is underway in several countries. Many more promising candidates in earlier stages are progressing toward pre-clinical and clinical evaluation. Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global advocate for HIV prevention, said that innovative science needed innovative funding. â€œWe need an expanded and more diverse global cadre of funders who will be involved in and dedicated to advancing HIV prevention R&D, including product delivery,â€� he said. â€œAnd these investments need to ensure that new options like daily oral PrEP, and potentially the dapivirine vaginal ring, do not sit on the shelf unused because we donâ€™t know how to effectively deliver them, and that future R&D better meets the needs and wants of those for whom the products are developed,â€� Warren added. â€” VNS",Society,"['end', '2030', 'adolescents', 'possible', 'rd', 'points', 'hiv', 'cure', 'prevention', 'research', 'aids', 'vaccine', 'development', 'global', 'epidemic', 'treatment']","Gia Lá»™cCHICAGO â€” New research in the treatment of AIDS has pointed to a possible cure, which could lead to the UNâ€™s goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030.

Workshop addresses health insurance challenges for HIV patients,Health experts discussed ways to tackle barriers and find solutions to provide social health insurance (SHI) to people living with HIV (PLHIV) at a workshop today in HCM City.,[],2016-08-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” Health experts discussed ways to tackle barriers and find solutions to provide social health insurance (SHI) to people living with HIV (PLHIV) at a workshop on Tuesday in HCM City. The event was jointly organised by the Viá»‡t Nam Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS with support from the HCM City Provincial AIDS Centre (HCMC PAC) and the US Agency for International Development through its Sustainable Management of the HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical Assistance project implemented by FHI 360. The workshop opened with testimonials from PLHIV, who revealed the challenges they faced with respect to enrolment in SHI to obtain coverage for HIV treatment. At the event, participants debated ways to overcome the challenges and to mobilise PLHIV to enroll in social health insurance. The workshop kicked off a series of events that focused on SHI access and utilisation among PLHIV that will culminate in a â€œRed Ribbonâ€� event at the end of the year. Representatives of the PLHIV community identified the cost of enrolling their families in social health insurance, the lack of a registered permanent residence and identity cards and the fear of disclosure of their HIV status as key barriers to SHI enrollment. â€œThe HCMC PAC will put all its effort to sustain 30,000 HIV patients currently undergoing HIV antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. We will work closely with the Vietnam Social Security to mobilize resources and overcome the barriers to enrollment,â€� said Doctor VÄƒn HÃ¹ng, head of Treatment Management Department, HCM PAC. â€œThe lessons learned from HCMC can be shared with other provinces encountering similar situations,â€� HÃ¹ng added. According to HCMC PAC statistics, as of June 2016, only 10,544 PLHIV, or 36 per cent of all ARV patients, in HCMC have health insurance cards. Moreover, just over a third of those PLHIV who have health insurance cards have used them to obtain HIV services. One out of every three Vietnamese HIV patients lives in HCM City. ARV drugs are an effective solution to safeguard the health of people living with HIV and to protect communities from the spread of the epidemic, as ARV treatment can reduce viral loads to negligible levels. According to the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Controlâ€™s statistics, up till the end of June, there were over 110,000 patients being treated with ARV drugs nationwide. Until now, ARV treatment has been made available free of charge due to international donor support. However, with Viá»‡t Nam emerging as a â€œmiddle income developing country,â€� donors have begun phasing out assistance, mandating SHI to cover and sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services.

Hope for elderly victims of HIV,"Cam Giang spends time with a special club in Vinh Tuy Ward, where old folks infected with HIV get a new lease on life through vocational training and activities such as baloon folding.",[],2008-07-20,vietnamnews.vn,"Living healthy: Members of 67 clubs for the elderly also benefit from monthly health checks and chances to increase their understanding of HIV/AIDS and self-care under the support of HelpAge International and Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union. â€” VNS Photo Viet Thanh New tricks: These three members of Vinh Tuy Club are among 2,110 old women given loans during the past two years. Two hearts beat as one: From the first lessons of making dolls and balloon animals by Quyen Tran (right), Bich Thuy (left) has brought his ideas into reality and taught people in over a dozen clubs to make balloons and fabric dolls. Cam Giang spends time with a special club in Vinh Tuy Ward, where old folks infected with HIV get a new lease on life through vocational training and activities such as baloon folding. Standing on the path that surrounds Hoan Kiem Lake, 51-year old Ninh Thi Hong feels anxious, dressed in her clown costume, carrying a handful of colourful balloons. Trying to ignore the curious stares of those around her, Hong smiles at the children that start to gather around. Her warmth is soon repaid, as a few minutes later she finds herself surrounded by a crowd as she hastily inflates new balloons, having already sold her first bundle. A rainbow of different colours and shapes, Hongâ€™s balloons are different than those usually found in that area, as they had been brought over from the US. Along with those extraordinary balloons, Hong herself is not your average balloon seller. She is the vice president of a special club that caters to the elderly affected by HIV/AIDS in Vinh Tuy Ward. Like a ""kindergarten"" Itâ€™s a rainy night as Vinh Tuyâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Committee opens its door as it usually does on the 14th day of every month. Outside, the street leading to the committee is crowded with the signs of construction, numerous sand dunes and pot-holes, making the way that much more treacherous in the rain. Despite these conditions, many elderly people can be seen making their way through the entrance. Today is the monthly meeting for all the elderly in Hongâ€™s club. Itâ€™s 7.30pm, and nearly 50 elderly women gather in the meeting room. While most of the seats have been taken, the ladies continue to crowd into the room. The rain falls outside, but its sound is drowned by the chatter, laughter and the ""pop"" of exploding balloons inside the room. These signs of joys make it hard to imagine the tragedies this group of women share. ""Keep it like this, and twist it into a tree trunk,"" says Hong, as she stands in the centre of the room, raising a long green balloon above her head. It has been five months since Hong sold balloons that first day at Hoan Kiem Lake. It was an experiment, and it was a success. More and more people are now following the path she started paving that day. The members of the club are following her balloon lesson, diligently trying to twist the green balloons into tree trunks. The crowd bursts into laughter after a balloon accidentally pops. ""We spend around VND500 for five balloons to make a complete animal, but we can sell it for VND5,000, so we make money quickly,"" says Hong. ""The work is realistic. It takes only half a day for members to learn how to turn balloons into various animals,"" says Tran Bich Thuy, a project officer at Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union, which provides direct support to the club. ""For the elderly who donâ€™t have much time left, half a day is ideal to learn a new skill, particularly when this work can help them earn money rather easily."" The secret, Thuy and Hong reveal, is where the balloons come from. They are purchased abroad and brought to Viet Nam by Quyen Tran, a regional programme manager at HelpAge International. When they first started the program, an expert from Thailand was brought in to teach the group how to make balloon animals. ""The balloons can be folded into many things, depending on the creativeness of the sellers,"" says Hong. ""You can even spell out â€˜Viet Namâ€™ to put on the heads of Vietnamese football fans,"" Thuy adds. Nguyen Thi Mua, a 64-year-old woman, is folding a balloon with her six-year-old granddaughter. One of Muaâ€™s sons is in prison, while her other son is now at a rehabilitation centre. ""I havenâ€™t missed a meeting since this club was established two years ago. We keep coming back not only because of the clubâ€™s vocational training lessons, but also its joyful atmosphere. Together, we escape from the sad stories of real life to engage in doing new things. Itâ€™s like a kindergarten for us,"" Mua smiles. Loans for the elderly The club at Vinh Tuy Ward is just one of 67 groups for elderly persons affected by HIV/AIDS in Ha Noi, Nam Dinh, Thai Nguyen and Quang Ninh provinces. Over the past two years, all these clubs have joined a new project named VIE011 (Community Mechanisms for Mitigating the Impact of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam), which aims to help improve the health and livelihoods of elderly living in challenging circumstances. Implemented by HelpAge International and Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union, the project covers many activities. What distinguishes it from similar projects are the loans available to older women, many of whom wouldnâ€™t qualify for loans under the Viet Nam Bank for Social Policies, the bank dedicated to helping socially disadvantaged people. ""Frankly, a bank is still a business, and this means that finances are always the top priority. It is commonly frowned upon to provide loans to an old woman. If a woman is over the working age and has children addicted to drugs or infected with HIV/AIDS, how can she be trusted to repay her loan?"" says Thuy. Project VIE011 not only provides loans to elderly persons affected by HIV/AIDS, but also provides them with training so that they can earn money and repay those loans. Other than encouraging people to run small businesses, like raising chickens, fish or pigs, or opening small restaurants or tea stalls, the project also teaches people new ways to earn money, such as selling balloons or making fabric dolls. On top of working as a regional programme manager at HelpAge International, Quyen Tran, a Vietnamese American, is also a teacher, helping these old women start fresh with new skills. Initiated by Quyen, the idea came to him when he realised that many old people were afraid to take out loans because they didnâ€™t know how to pay them back. Working in Thailand for the past five years, Quyen saw that the Thai government had a policy of ""100 jobs for people"", finding employment for anyone willing to work. He wanted to copy that model in Viet Nam. To bring that model over, Quyen filled his suitcase with American-made balloons, catalogues of dolls from Thailand and other hand-made toys, as well as the necessary materials to make them. As he landed in Viet Nam, project VIE011 took flight. Following the success of the balloon animal business, the next doll-making scheme was implemented seven months ago, and has so far proven just as successful. Under Quyenâ€™s guidance, seven members from another club for the elderly have completed hundreds of dolls. While their needle work may require a little more practice, the dolls are attractive enough to generate orders from some Vietnamese businesses, expatriates in Viet Nam and even officers from the Italian Embassy. Realising the potential of hand-made products, and Thuyâ€™s continued support, Quyen has now spent some of his own money on yet another do-it-yourself business scheme: teaching the elderly to make embroidered hats. Opening a catalogue displaying an endless selection of hand-made items, Quyen confides, ""I believe that there are a hundred simple things that we can make by hand, and childrenâ€™s toys is still an untapped market. If we can learn these jobs successfully, we have a chance to provide jobs for hundreds of labourers, including the elderly and their HIV/AIDS infected children."" Where is our future? It is a shared belief that the best place to care for HIV/AIDS victims is at home with their family. Any programme aiming to help these groups, then, must keep this basic principal in mind. For the elderly who live with, or are HIV/AIDS victims, the burden on their shoulders is often tripled. Apart from taking care of their infected children, they often become the primary caregiver to their sometimes infected grandchildren. At a time in their lives when they should be looked after by society or by their own children, they are still looking after themselves, finding no time to rest in their old age. Thuy, the project officer, says that the situation in Viet Nam is becoming worse as HIV/AIDS is now so often linked to drug addiction. Many families of HIV/AIDS victims lose everything they have to drugs. The elderly can often be the most affected, scraping by as they try to feed their HIV/AIDS infected children. Even when their children pass away, they are still left to the mercy of society, as their children leave nothing behind but their bodies. ""Although 100 per cent of the elderly questioned ask nothing for themselves, only their children, it doesnâ€™t mean they arenâ€™t in need. So far, there is no project except VIE011 providing loans or work opportunities for these people. In most cases, only the HIV/AIDS victims or their children receive financial support,"" Thuy says. The VE011 project has often been the only avenue these women have to turn to, and has so far provided 2,110 loans to elderly women over the past two years. ""Giving loans to the elderly is not as risky as is commonly thought. On the contrary, elderly women have proven to be safe borrowers. Under our project, 100 per cent of people have given their loans back before the deadline,"" Thuy reveals. According to Quyen, older people are usually responsible in the way they invest their loans. If they donâ€™t know how to invest it, then they wonâ€™t take the loan. ""Itâ€™s important that we help them find ways to earn money, whether they have the loans or not,"" Quyen says. As he continues to teach people to make and sell crafts, he has many more tricks up his sleeve to help these disadvantaged families. ""After the initial project, it will be difficult to get the members steady work at doll or embroidery clubs. Weâ€™ll need the help of businesses to ensure output,"" says Thuy. ""We donâ€™t need another volunteer, but a real enterprise interested in our product so that we can expand."" As the group looks for an enterprise to bring their small project to the larger scale, the women will continue to gather at their scattered club locations. Sharing a laugh while learning a new skill, the women escape their hardships just for a day, on a path that will hopefully lead them to a brighter place in life. â€” VNS",Sunday,"['balloons', 'project', 'women', 'club', 'nam', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'hope', 'viet', 'quyen', 'loans', 'victims', 'elderly']","Itâ€™s 7.30pm, and nearly 50 elderly women gather in the meeting room.

"Learning English empowers people living with, affected by, HIV/AIDS","English study may be regarded as a luxury for people living with HIV/AIDS, but 35-year-old Kim Thi Hau says it has invigorated her struggle for a brighter future.",[],2005-11-24,vietnamnews.vn,"Learning English empowers people living with, affected by, HIV/AIDS (24-11-2005) by Van Anh A UNV English tutor teaching a group of doctors and nurses who work with people living with HIV/AIDS.â€”UNV/VNS Photo Philipp Essl HAI PHONG â€” English study may be regarded as a luxury for people living with HIV/AIDS, but 35-year-old Kim Thi Hau says it has invigorated her struggle for a brighter future. There are many reasons for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to study English. ""Proficiency in English enables me to understand labels and instructions on ARV [anti-retroviral] medication by myself,"" she said, revealing the immediate, practical side for people in her situation. ""I was infected by my intravenous drug-addicted husband, but my four-year old son is free from the disease, so I need to live for him now,"" she said. Hau is a member of Hai Phongâ€™s Hoa Phuong Do self-help group, and studies under the English Tutoring Scheme conducted by the United Nations Volunteer (UNV) organisation in Viet Nam. Launched last year, the tutoring scheme works with people living with HIV/AIDS, and those affected by the disease, including families, doctors, nurses, social workers and public healthcare officials. Some students say the benefits go beyond simply learning a new language. Hau said that while studying English and speaking to PLWHA, her ability to communicate with people in Vietnamese also improved, and felt she could better empathize with others. ""Iâ€™ve become much closer to people who are seriously ill and will die soon."" The volunteer tutoring programme operates in Ha Noi and Hai Phong with ongoing support from 12-15 national and international volunteers, and around 80 students have so far benefited from the programme. Building confidence ""Proficiency in English helps PLWHA strengthen their self-confidence by overcoming the psychological barrier of talking to foreigners,"" said the manager of the UNV English Tutoring Scheme for PLWHA, Philipp Essl. He explained that many programme participants faced stigmatization and discrimination, and the English Tutoring programme, part of the Greater Involvement for People Living with HIV Project, was designed to help people overcome both these issues. Although not HIV positive, one young student joined the Hoa Phuong Do English classes as an HIV/AIDS activist to work with the self-help group. ""PLWHA are just like me and you. Discrimination against them is unfair,"" she said. ""I want to help these women spread information about HIV/AIDS prevention to the community."" Her all-woman group has 8 key members, and about 50 regular supporters. They take care of each other when they are ill, and help families when members die of AIDS-related diseases. Tonia Timperley, a Canadian Viet kieu (overseas Vietnamese) UNV English tutor in Ha Noi, said she encourages students to at least appear confident when they speak English, which then translates into actual self-confidence. Timperley, who teaches doctors and nurses working with PLWHA at the Dong Da District Health Centre said her students were driven by a strong motivation to help others, and worked very hard to overcome the challenges of learning a new language. Approaching donors Pham Thanh Van, a UNV English tutor working with the Hoa Phuong Do group in Hai Phong, said the programme raised the profile of HIV/AIDS awareness activities conducted by the group. Members now had more opportunities to communicate with donor groups, including international non-governmental organisations. ""By speaking English they can approach donation sources for funds to finance their activities, and have access to the latest information on medication, treatment, and HIV/AIDS prevention. In this way they become effective sources of information for the community."" Van explained that despite the sad reality that many students are conscious that they might not live long enough to speak English proficiently, they strongly encourage other PLWHA to join the classes. Essl said demand for new classes was very high, and that he was working on strengthening their organizational capacity in order to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the programme. He said extending the scheme was vital, but that it depended on finding sources of funding. Building leadership Essl said the English tutoring scheme was especially important for people in leadership positions representing the HIV/AIDS community. He said that because these people are particularly exposed to the international community, they had an extra incentive to improve their English ability. ""We focus on that by offering intensive one-on-one tutoring to PLWHA in community leadership positions, such as leaders of self-help groups,"" he said. Essl said the scheme was part of an overall plan to empower people at the grassroots level to be community leaders affecting real social change. He said the leadership focus is also true for people who work with people who are HIV positive. Staff from numerous self-help groups, local and international NGOs and local health centres also benefit from the programme. Pham Thi Hue, 25, founder of the Hoa Phuong Do group is one community leader benefiting from the scheme. ""As the groupâ€™s leader, I meet and communicate with international supporters, including donor organisations. I found not being able to speak English well previously held me back,"" she said. The strong positive attitude and inspiring spirit of the students motivates the volunteer teachers to continue their work. As Hoa Phuong Do class member Hau said, ""Even though I may not live a long life, learning English will definitely help me.""",Society,"['plwha', 'english', 'affected', 'living', 'scheme', 'students', 'empowers', 'hivaids', 'group', 'unv', 'learning', 'tutoring', 'programme']","Learning English empowers people living with, affected by, HIV/AIDS(24-11-2005)by Van AnhA UNV English tutor teaching a group of doctors and nurses who work with people living with HIV/AIDS.â€”UNV/VNS Photo Philipp EsslHAI PHONG â€” English study may be regarded as a luxury for people living with HIV/AIDS, but 35-year-old Kim Thi Hau says it has invigorated her struggle for a brighter future.

High-risk groups fail to heed HIV advice,"After five years, a nationwide campaign of harm reduction and HIV prevention among sex workers has not proven effective, a review conference heard yesterday.",[],2011-04-28,vietnamnews.vn,"Fishermen receive leaflets on HIV/AIDS prevention during a communication programme in Dong Hai Ward, Hai An District, Hai Phong City.â€”VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc. HCM CITY â€” After five years, a nationwide campaign of harm reduction and HIV prevention among sex workers has not proven effective, a review conference heard yesterday. Health officials said several programmes have been carried out to protect sex workers from HIV and other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases), but these have suffered from many problems including a lack of co-ordination between agencies fighting HIV/AIDS. Nguyen Trong Dam, deputy Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said prostitutes were among the population groups most vulnerable to HIV infections in Viet Nam, besides intravenous drug users. The situation has become more and more serious, Dam said. He said despite the implementation of several awareness programmes, condom use among sex workers, including males, was very low. He said stronger co-ordination was needed between public security forces, health agencies and the labour sector to help sex workers remain safe from diseases like HIV/AIDS and also facilitate their reintegration into the community after rehabilitation. ""A few years ago, it was easy to see female sex workers in public places like bus stations and pavements, but most of the now go online or adopt more sophisticated forms of services,"" Dam said. Prostitution has become one of the main causes of HIV transmission, health workers said. According to recent statistics, the rate of HIV infections among sex workers was pretty high in major cities, 20 per cent in Ha Noi, 23 per cent in Hai Phong and 16 per cent in HCM City. HIV infection among sex workers was as high as 30 per cent, the conference heard. Duong Van Dat, an officer with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA, said very few sex workers were able to access HIV prevention services like free condoms and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. This situation had to change drastically, he added. Dat noted that the Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, had recently said that it was not possible to get rid of prostitution totally and that intensified focus was necessary on harm reduction among sex workers. He said that in Cambodia, up to 80 per cent of the sex workers were using condoms and the incidence of HIV and other STDs had fallen sharply. In Viet Nam, there was a large number of sex workers who dont use condoms because they cannot access it, he added. Condoms were not easily available in public places in Viet Nam like hotels, and there were cultural barriers that prevented both the sex workers as well as their clients from purchasing them, he said. According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention Department under the Health Ministry, as of September 30, 2010, the country had 180,312 HIV positive people, 42,339 AIDS patients and 48,368 people had died of AIDS. The epidemic has spread widely with HIV populations in all provinces, 97 per cent of the districts and 70 per cent of communes nation-wide, department officials said. Eighty per cent of the HIV positive population in Viet Nam were males, they added. Dr Nguyen Minh Tam of the department said the rate of HIV transmission was particularly high among males who had sex with males (MSM). She cited a survey in 2009 that found just 47.4 per cent of the MSM population in HCM City used condoms regularly with their partners. The rate was higher in Ha Noi and Hai Phong. The Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs said at the conference that it would expand the programme for harm reduction and STD prevention among sex workers in the country over the next five years. It said it was important to improve the knowledge and awareness among local governments of the crucial importance of providing free condoms, especially to high-risk populations. Local officials with low awareness have made it very difficult to promote the use of condoms, ministry officials told the conference.",Society,"['fail', 'advice', 'hiv', 'heed', 'officials', 'viet', 'highrisk', 'population', 'cent', 'prevention', 'condoms', 'groups', 'workers', 'sex', 'hai']","Fishermen receive leaflets on HIV/AIDS prevention during a communication programme in Dong Hai Ward, Hai An District, Hai Phong City.â€”VNA/VNS Photo Duong Ngoc.

This was revealed by director of the health ministrys Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Nguyen Hoang Long at a meeting last week in the central province of Thua Thien-Hue. The meeting, which was attended by experts from the Ministry of Health and departments of health from 63 provinces and cities, summed up HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures during the first six months of this year and set up plan for the remaining months. The country gave Methadone treatment to more than 31,000 patients and administered antiretroviral (ARV) to nearly 96,000 ones during this period of time. As many as 28 out of 63 provinces and cities have approved a plan to ensure funds for HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures. Long noted that HIV/AIDS preventive measures in the past months saw some limitations as the number of condoms and injection needles delivered free-of-charge decreased compared with the same period last year. Only 38 per cent of the expected number of people received Methadone and 35 provinces and cities did not approve plans for funding HIV/AIDS prevention and control measures. Long has proposed a plan for the last six months of this year, including expanding treatment and prevention services, improving treatment with Methadone and ARV, increasing HIV discovery, and completing a plan for supplying ARV. Addressing the event, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long highly appreciated the achievements of the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control in the past years. Statistics of the Ministry of Health showed that during the 2001-15 period, the country saved 150,000 people living with HIV from fatalities and saved 10,000 children from being transmitting HIV from their mothers. Deputy Minister Long has asked all relevant bodies to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention and focus on prevention as the main measure. Treatment with ARV should be improved to ensure that 90 per cent of the people living with HIV receive the medicine. HIV tests should be expanded so that 90 per cent of the people living with HIV are aware of their condition.

The year 2016 marked the ninth consecutive year Viá»‡t Nam has witnessed a reduction in the number of new HIV infections, cases of HIV developing into full-blown AIDS, and AIDS-related fatalities, Long said. Viá»‡t Nam has carried out comprehensive and effective measures to combat HIV/AIDS while focusing on caring for, supporting, and curing people living with HIV/AIDS, he reiterated. Viá»‡t Nam has actively responded to the 90-90-90 goals set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UN AIDS), that ensures at least 90 per cent of all people with HIV will know their status, and that 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, and 90 percent of all people receiving ARV therapy will be diagnosed with viral suppression. The Deputy Minister called for a drastic and joint effort to combat HIV/AIDS, with focus on early HIV/AIDS screening and testing. Localities should also push forward with efforts to realise the Three-Zero target of no new HIV infections, no death from AIDS, and no discrimination against HIV/AIDS carriers.

As international donors have halted support for HIV/AIDS treatment in Viá»‡t Nam, how will prevention and control be affected? There will certainly be difficulties. Every year, there are about 10,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS carriers in Viá»‡t Nam. If we do not have proper and timely intervention, there is a great risk of outbreaks. While other diseases all have vaccines, the only â€œvaccineâ€� for HIV/AIDS is communications. However, budget for communications is very limited. Meanwhile, condoms, needles and methadone are essential for intervention and prevention. The current methadone source, which is used to replace drugs, is stable for 50,000 users. However, needles and condoms have no supply sources. In the past, 90 per cent of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV/AIDS carriers were provided for free by international donors, especially the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. But such funding has been rapidly cut down, to 40 per cent this year and will end next year. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS has pledged to run until the end of this year. We are working on plans to mobilise more fund to continue the programme. Some projects are calling for private fundings. But they are suitable for methadone replacement and providing condoms and needles. It will be more difficult when dealing with communications, testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS. In 2015, when the information about withdrawing international funding was first made public, the rate of HV/AIDS carriers with health insurance was about 30-40 per cent. So far, the number is only up to some 50 per cent. Do you think the process of providing health insurance is too slow? We have examined why the rate is so low and learned that many people hesitate to use health insurance as their personal information can be exposed. They are afraid that their HIV/AIDS disease will be stated on the insurance card. In fact, such information will not be on the card. The medical record will be confidential. To help the patients understand more about the programme, we will provide them with information leaflets about how to buy health insurance, how much they have to pay and where to buy it. In the past, HIV/AIDS treatment was free so patients did not pay much attention to health insurance. A recent decision of the Prime Minister has set the target of having all patients covered by health insurance by 2020. Also in the past, nearly 400 clinics with ARV supply received fundings for staff salaries, drugs. But now, they will face many difficulties. How will we deal with difficulties when the funding ends by the end of 2018? Currently, there are nearly 230,000 HIV/AIDS carriers in Viá»‡t Nam, 116,000 of those are receiving ARV treatment. Without donor funds, we will need a huge amount of finance to maintain treatment. In the past, ARV treatment aimed to reduce the death rate. But now, everyone found to have HIV/AIDS can get ARV treatment for prevention and good health. The Government has pledged a 90-90-90 model, which means 90 per cent of people living with HIV will know their HIV status; 90 per cent of people who know their status are on HIV treatment; and 90 per cent of all people on treatment will have undetectable levels of HIV in their body. We are going to reach the first target as some 80 per cent of affected people have been discovered. As for the third target, Viá»‡t Nam is among the countries with qualified treatment for HIV/AIDS patients beyond the requirements of international organisations. However, the second target, or the number of patients receiving ARV treatment, is still low. The bidding on providing drugs under the health insurance system for HIV/AIDS patients will start now (within the first quarter of 2017) and the drugs will be provided to patients in the third quarter of this year. â€” VNS",Society,"['drugs', 'funds', 'arv', 'patients', 'viá»‡t', 'vn', 'foreign', 'absent', 'hivaids', 'cent', 'aids', 'target', 'control', 'treatment', 'health', 'insurance']","Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, head of the Ministry of Healthâ€™s Department for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, talks to the Tuá»•i Tráº» (Youth) about plans for HIV/AIDS treatment.

Palliative care guidelines updated,"All people who suffer from life-threatening diseases will be eligible for palliative care, with the care beginning as soon as their diseases are detected, due to a change in a national guidance on palliative care.",[],2017-08-05,vietnamnews.vn,"A doctor examines an HIV patient at the Viá»‡t Nam-Czech Friendship Hospital in the northern port city of Háº£i PhÃ²ng. â€” VNA/VNS Photo DÆ°Æ¡ng Ngá»�c HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” All people who suffer from life-threatening diseases will be eligible for palliative care, with the care beginning as soon as their diseases are detected, due to a change in a national guidance on palliative care. LÆ°Æ¡ng Ngá»�c KhuÃª, head of the Department of Medical Examination and Treatment under health ministry made the statement on Thursday during discussion on amendments to the guidance. According to the World Health Organisation, palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and treatment of pain and other problems. In 2006, with assistance from national and international experts, the health ministry issued guidance on palliative care for cancer and AIDS patients. KhuÃª said the guidance was a legal basis and reference point for healthcare workers to deliver proper care. â€œSo far, hundreds of doctors and nurses have undergone palliative care training and thousands of patients have received improved care in the last stage of their life,â€� KhuÃª said. The updated document expands the subjects of the specialised medical and nursing care to all people with life-limiting illnesses. It also encourages the building of multi-component groups, which include medical staff, families, social workers and volunteers, to care for patients. Palliative care can take place at hospitals, at home and within the community. Eric Krakauer, an expert from the World Health Organisation, said the therapy helps reduce pain and should be incorporated into primary and comprehensive healthcare. According to Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control under the Ministry of Health, by May this year, Viá»‡t Nam had more than 209,000 people living with HIV. In the first five months of this year, more than 1,900 people infected with the HIV virus contracted AIDS. The first five month of this year saw 3,546 new HIV cases and 641 HIV-related deaths, deceases of 11 per cent and 34 per cent respectively compared with the same period last year. The administration also reported that only about 50 per cent of people with HIV in Viá»‡t Nam have health insurance cards, with some not buying the insurance as they are afraid of discrimination, others being unable to afford it and some lacking necessary personal legal documents.

The 2006-08 project will be implemented by the National Assemblyâ€™s Committee for Social Affairs, in co-ordination with the authorities of three provinces: Lang Son in the north, Khanh Hoa in the centre and An Giang in the south. The director of the NAâ€™s Committee for Social Affairs, Nguyen Thi Hoai Thu, said at the signing ceremony in Ha Noi yesterday that there were still many challenges ahead in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam. ""HIV is a disease, but effective prevention and control does not depend solely on the efforts of the health sector, but also on the efforts of all of society, including government and elected bodies at all levels."" In response, acting UNDP Resident Representative Subinay Nandy said effective leadership was essential in the fight against HIV/AIDS. ""Good policies and a solid legal framework will encourage all of society, particularly those affected by HIV and AIDS, to get involved."" He said it was vital that everyone, including those living with or affected by HIV/AIDS, participate in decision-making, have access to accurate information, quality treatment and health care services. Most importantly, he suggested, it was necessary for all people to live free from discrimination. International experiences have shown that leaders have a valuable role in engaging the public to fight stigma and intolerance, as well as to set an example in the struggle against HIV/AIDS, he added. Beyond the central level, the project will help authorities of the three provinces to integrate HIV/AIDS concerns into local socio-economic development plans, and ensure that the approach to HIV/AIDS prevention at the local level is collaborative. Peopleâ€™s Councils and local government will be supported in taking a leading role in guiding the implementation of public information campaigns to eliminate stigma and discrimination directed at people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).

The programme will be first implemented in Ha Noi, HCM City and provinces of Dien Bien, and Nghe An and Thanh Hoa from the fourth quarter of this year to the end of the third quarter of 2017. The department said it would publish guidelines for proper HIV testing and provide training to non-specialised health workers, and also adopt a mechanism for co-ordination between community-based organisations and clinics that perform HIV tests and those offering anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment. A system for monitoring and evaluating community-based HIV testing results will also be launched. There are three community-based HIV testing models including mobile HIV testing and counselling, HIV testing and counselling at local health care units, and community-based organisations. These testing models will be applied to groups of people who are drug addicts, relatives of HIV carriers (wife, husband and their children), sex workers, and gays and lesbians, in addition to men at places that have high rate of HIV sufferers (over 1 per cent). Statistics from the Department of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control showed that as of June, there were 227,114 people living with HIV in Viet Nam. Of these, 71,115 HIV carriers had progressed to AIDS and 76,588 people had died. The country has over 1,100 HIV testing and counselling units and 98 HIV testing laboratories that conduct tests of around 2 million samples each year. It is estimated that about 200,000 people living with HIV are aware of their status while the remaining are unaware, thereby posing high risk of HIV transmission in society. The community-based HIV testing and counselling programme takes place at a time when the funding for HIV prevention is to be reduced and traditional HIV test models have met with difficulties. Health officials said at a workshop held in Ha Noi last month that Viet Nam will need at least VND7.4 trillion (US$329 million) for the programme from 2016 to 2020, but it will lack about 11 per cent of the capital.

Software to ensure health insurance for HIV patients,An electronic health information system (eHIS) aims to help people living with HIV/AIDS get more benefits from social health insurance.,[],2016-07-21,vietnamnews.vn,"Ä�Iá»†N BIÃŠN â€” An electronic health information system (eHIS) with the aims to help people living with HIV/AIDS get more benefits from social health insurance has been developed in the northern Ä�iá»‡n BiÃªn Provinceâ€™s Tuáº§n GiÃ¡o District Healthcare Centre. The system-part of the Sustainable Management of HIV/AIDS Response and Transition to Technical Assistance project launched by the Vietnamese government and the United States Agency for International Development (USAIDS) is an integration of an HIV module and medical records of people with HIV/AIDS, according to project officials. The HIV software module allows the district healthcare centre to easily track and request reimbursement for HIV patient examinations and services. After three months of implementing the project, the district healthcare centre reported it had received more than VNÄ�22.7 million (US$1,000) as reimbursement from the health insurance fund for HIV patient examinations. The centre said it was managing 467 HIV patients through the eHIS, allowing doctors to make better decisions by providing easy access to medical records of patients such as clinic assessments, test results and treatment for both infections and HIV. The software was expected to be fine-tuned and implemented across Ä�iá»‡n BiÃªn Province and the central Nghá»‡ An Province, according to project official. Trá»‹nh Ä�á»©c Long, director of the Tuáº§n GiÃ¡o District Healthcare Centre, on Thursday said at a workshop on sharing experiences on social health insurance for HIV patients that local people living with HIV/AIDS were poor and faced many difficulties such as lack of transportation to travel long distances to healthcare centres for treatment or lack of health insurance. Social health insurance coverage of HIV services was their social security, he said. The eHIS has greatly helped to revolutionise local healthcare service procedures, Long said. â€œHealthcare providers such as us can now monitor patients better, request reimbursement from social health insurance, and process detailed patient reports with a single click. For patients, it means we have more time to care for them and can do so more quickly and effectively as making patient records are instantly accessible,â€� Long said.

HIV club becomes model help group,"After being driven to near financial ruin and blamed by her husband's family for contracting HIV, Duong Thu Huong was saddened once again when doctors reported that her nine-month old son would die of AIDS within days.",[],2006-11-30,vietnamnews.vn,"HIV club becomes model help group (30-11-2006) by Thu Giang and Quynh Hoa QUANG NINH â€” After being driven to near financial ruin and blamed by her husbandâ€™s family for contracting HIV, Duong Thu Huong was saddened once again when doctors reported that her nine-month old son would die of AIDS within days. Huong, like many other women in Viet Nam, has faced insurmountable difficulties since discovering she had contracted the deadly disease. In a country where suicides are not uncommon when a patient is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, Huong has found hope in the Hoa xuong rong (Cactus Flower) Club. Run by other HIV infected individuals, the club helps those living with the disease through volunteer work and direct financial support, and tries to break down the many negative stigmas HIV/AIDS has in Viet Nam. As a result of its success, the club has become the new model for the Governmentâ€™s Centre for Community Health and Development (COHED). The group has also received support from the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a US funded programme to help infected women overcome discrimination in both society and their families. When Huong discovered she had HIV, her husbandâ€™s family was far from supportive. ""I was shocked and scared when I received the test results. My husbandâ€™s family blamed it all on me, and told everyone that I was a debauched wife. With no care and no money, I almost killed myself,"" said Huong in a recent interview. The family eventually discovered that a man, with which Huongâ€™s husband had shared a knife to tattoo themselves, had died from AIDS and was the likely culprit in spreading the disease. Thanks to a suggestion from a relative in the healthcare profession, Huong joined the Cactus Flower Club a year ago, and now helps other families and individuals cope with HIV/AIDS. If a person is excommunicated by their relatives, the club will take them in, and care for them. ""We have nothing to lose. We are willing to do anything from helping a person bathe and feed themselves to washing clothes. Through our work, we hope that people living with AIDS will at least experience a small degree of joy before passing away,"" said Huong. When the clubâ€™s Ha Long City chapter opened a year ago, Huong was one of 58 members who were divided into three groups. The first group included 30 people who were public about living with HIV/AIDS and were responsible for approaching other women who seek consoling and healthcare. The second group had 25 people who were responsible for disseminating information to the public and caring for people living with HIV/AIDS. The last group consisted of three people who co-ordinated the chapterâ€™s operations. After its first year, the chapter approached more than 3,640 people, of which 395 were living with HIV/AIDS, and cared for nearly 40 AIDS patients. ""One year may seem like a short time for a healthy person, but it is a very long time for a person living with HIV/AIDS,"" says Nguyen Thi Thom, a fellow club member. Dr. Nguyen Thi Tien, club chief, says the group still faces a number of difficulties; many of its members have limited education, financial support and accesses to medicine. There are also problems in gathering accurate information in the rural and coastal provinces on the number of people living with HIV/AIDS and the number of new infections. The club, though, does have the financial and technical support of US-based PEPFAR. According to Duong Quoc Trong, director of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, PEPFAR has been an active contributor to local organisations since beginning HIV/AIDS prevention programmes in June 2004. PEPFAR has so far supplied anti-retroviral drugs to more than 3,300 patients and has treated more than 800 pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child infection. Trong added that the Ministry of Health had also supported PEPFARâ€™s Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic â€“ Global Aids Programme. The health ministry and the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control are also carrying out their own HIV/AIDS prevention programmes nationwide.",Society,"['huong', 'club', 'women', 'living', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'person', 'aids', 'group', 'model', 'help', 'support']","Huong, like many other women in Viet Nam, has faced insurmountable difficulties since discovering she had contracted the deadly disease.

All have themselves experienced the misery caused by the virus. Aged between 25 and 31, they have focused their effort in Sam Son, both the town and its beach as well as neighbouring communes, since they began work last October. Their major task is to persuade sex workers and drug addicts of the need for precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. They worked unofficially at first but when physicians and health staff saw the positive result of their effort, the Thanh Hoa Health Department joined with them in establishing contact with potential carriers and having them tested. Initially, many could not understand why such young women could dedicate their lives to such a dangerous task but they changed when they heard the story of their lives and their motives for doing the work. The family of Nguyen Thuy Phuong (not her real name) was poor, but she and her four siblings were educated. Her eldest brother, a truck driver, was addicted to drugs and her family was traumatised when they found that he was infected with the deadly virus. Grief-stricken, and encouraged by a thoughtless friend, Phuong became a prostitute. She stopped when one night she realised that she was alone and without virtue and began work as a vendor. It was not easy to forget the easy money but she did well. Today, she has a husband and is the mother of three children. The other six tell similar stories: They worked either as prostitutes; had addicted siblings or abusive husbands. They joined together to atone for past actions and help others to avoid the virus. Building a rapport with those they want to help is their most difficult task. Some of these are solitary while others work in hotels and restaurants so the seven divide into what they call the street group and the entertainment group. Hanh, 31, says her first task is to contact with a girl famous for her youth and beauty and working in Sam Son named Mai (not her real name) who is infected with the virus. She knew such an attractive girl was unlikely to practise safe sex. But it took ten visits to the karaoke where the youngster works and a recounting of her own story before Hanh was able to persuade Mai about the danger of infecting others. Another of the seven, Van, 25, says: ""I always see addicts inject themselves with the same needle."" Once, seeing five doing so and understanding that this was a way of spreading the virus, she waited until the effects of the drug had worn off and told them about the dangers of using the same needle and gave them money to buy their own. Sam Son has an estimated 200 addicts and 100 prostitutes. The rate of HIV/AIDS infection is not known although 51 incidents have been reported. The seven young women have persuaded three prostitutes to quit their work and two now have their own families.",Society,"['peer', 'young', 'help', 'women', 'fight', 'seven', 'hivaids', 'join', 'infected', 'son', 'hoa', 'group', 'work', 'task', 'successful']","Women join fight against HIV/AIDS with successful peer group(15-08-2005)A public information station to tackle HIV/AIDS in Tan Chau town in the southern province of An Giang. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Hoang HaiTHANH HOA â€” Seven young women, who have formed a dong dang, or peer group, to both prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and help those already infected in Thanh Hoa Province on the central coast, are linked by a common fate.

Official: Progress made on reducing HIV transmission,"The number of people with HIV in Viet Nam has fallen to under 0.3 per cent, said National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs Vice Chairman Dang Thuan Phong at a conference on Thursday.",[],2014-07-12,vietnamnews.vn,"HA NOI (VNS) â€”The number of people with HIV in Viet Nam has fallen to under 0.3 per cent, said National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs Vice Chairman Dang Thuan Phong at a conference on Thursday. The Ha Noi-based conference, ""Investment strategy on HIV/AIDS prevention and control"", was organized by the National Assembly Committee for Social Affairs in coordination with the Viet Nam Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Phong said that Viet Nam had successfully achieved ""three reductions"" in efforts to decrease the number of people diagnosed with HIV, the rate of cases that progressed to AIDS and the number of AIDS-related deaths. A survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in May showed that the number of new HIV positive patients had fallen to 2,012 in the first quarter of this year, a 35 per cent drop from the same period last year. The number of cases that had progressed to AIDS had decreased by 47 per cent while the number of AIDS-related deaths had declined by 53 per cent. However, Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control Director General Nguyen Hoang Long warned that the number of HIV/AIDS infections were increasing. He said that 77 per cent of HIV transmission in the community was driven by drug use. Unprotected sexual activity with prostitutes and between same-sex partners were also alleged to be factors contributing to HIV transmission. Participants at the conference agreed that the latter factors presented challenges in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The limited services available to the public was also said to be constraining efforts to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Statistics provided by the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control at the conference showed one third of HIV-positive patients were unable to receive treatment and that the supply of condoms and syringes was not meeting demand. Financial struggle Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control Director General Nguyen Hoang Long said that the budget for the national target programme on HIV/AIDS prevention and control had decreased since 2012. The budget was reduced from VND 245 billion (US$ 11.7 million) in 2012 to VND207 billion ($10 million) in the following year and has been slashed 60 per cent to VND 83 billion ($4 million) in 2014. He also said that international assistance had supported up to 80 per cent of expenditure to control HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam but that finance for the projects was in its final stage. The prime minister-approved plan ""Securing finance for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the period of 2013-2020"" received praise from UNAIDS Viet Nam Country Director, Kristan Schoultz as a long term effort against HIV/AIDS. Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control also proposed a new national target program in HIV/AIDS prevention and control for the period of 2016-2020 and a plan to secure funds to provide ARV (HIV antiretroviral drug) and methadone, the two most commonly used drugs for HIV. Future plans The administration stressed that the key objective was to strengthen prevention and containment efforts for HIV/AIDS, including rolling out HIV/AIDS control centers across the country, treatment centers for AIDS patients and treatment centers utilising methadone therapy. Future plans to raise public awareness and provide education were also raised at the conference. Schoultz of UNAIDS said that Viet Nam needed to come up with plans to achieve the best results in providing HIV prevention services and also to provide financial sustainability for its programmes. â€” VNS",Society,"['national', 'progress', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'transmission', 'prevention', 'cent', 'administration', 'control', 'number', 'reducing', 'official']","However, Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control Director General Nguyen Hoang Long warned that the number of HIV/AIDS infections were increasing.

Viet Nam News reporter Le Quynh Anh spoke to relevant stakeholders on how Viet Nam should move forward. Professor Chung A, senior advisor to the Government on HIV/AIDS affairs The fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been going on for 20 years. There was a period from 1995 to 2005 where we faced extreme difficulties as HIV spread rapidly. However, because the desire to combat this disease remains strong throughout the entire political system, we have gradually brought the situation under control. In addition, our strategies to fight HIV/AIDS have been consistent with international practice. For that reason, we received a lot of support from the international community. Since 2009, the number of new HIV infections has steadily decreased. Also, we have built well-trained task forces that are on active duty around the country. Another remarkable figure is that nearly 70,000 HIV/AIDS patients have received treatment â€“ an achievement we did not dare to dream of 10 years ago. The HIV-infected patients have growing confidence in the Government so they participate more actively in the HIV/AIDS efforts initiated by the Government. As we have successfully emerged from poverty to become a low middle-income country, we now face the challenge of reduced international assistance. It makes sense that donors would relocate resources to more economically challenged countries. We are facing an imminent shortage of resources for HIV/AIDS. Over the last decade, we have increased the level of funding for HIV/AIDS activities from US$0.06 to $1 per capita. International assistance accounts for 80 per cent of the total: the annual funding from the State hovers around $7 million, while contributions from donors can be as high as $87 million. Once these contributions stop, we will face an enormous challenge. And in the absence of international support, our capacity to build HIV/AIDS task forces will be greatly affected. These are concerns that the Government has started to address. Meanwhile, the reduction of international assistance occurs as the HIV epidemic in Viet Nam is undergoing a dramatic shift. HIV infection is no longer concentrated in urban areas but has begun to spread to remote rural districts. As HIV finds its way to ethnic people who have struggled with poverty for years, new challenges emerge. Another new challenge is that drug users, especially youngsters, have switched to synthetic drugs. Without continued funding, we may face a new wave of the HIV epidemic. To move forward, first of all, we need to maintain the strong political will to combat this disease that was displayed in previous years. Secondly, the National Assembly should revisit its budget plan to allocate more funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. While it is inevitable that we must increase the funding from the State budget, we also need to draw resources from other stakeholders. Why dont we begin with the community itself? As of now, all of the HIV-related treatment expenses are fully covered, so we should come up with mechanisms that are more selective. For example, patients who are in better financial condition should be required to share their burdens with the State. We could also seek support from enterprises, charity organisations and religious groups. Advisors even recommended the Government use Official Development Assistance in the fight against the HIV epidemic, just as these funds are used to develop infrastructure. Tony E. Lisle, Country Director, UNAIDS Viet Nam Tony E. Lisle Viet Nam has made great progress in responding to HIV in recent years. Coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ARV) has increased 22-fold since 2005, providing life-saving treatment for more than 60 per cent of adults and more than 80 per cent of children living with HIV. New infections among injecting drug users and sex workers are stable following the scale-up of the needle and syringe program, the condom program and the methadone maintenance treatment program.

Coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ARV) has increased 22-fold since 2005, providing life-saving treatment for more than 60 per cent of adults and more than 80 per cent of children living with HIV. New infections among injecting drug users and sex workers are stable following the scale-up of the needle and syringe program, the condom program and the methadone maintenance treatment program. The international community currently funds more than 70 per cent of Viet Nams HIV response and an even greater percentage of HIV treatment and prevention programmes targeting key populations at higher risk of infection. However, that will change. Viet Nam is one of the 21st centurys economic success stories, and soon it will no longer need international development assistance. As aid slowly reduces, Viet Nam will need to invest more domestic resources on evidence-informed, cost-effective and rights-based approaches. The priority should be a smooth continuum of HIV prevention, treatment and care services for people who inject drugs, sex workers and men who have sex with men. The ARV program also needs special attention. We now know that people on treatment are much less likely to transmit the virus to others, so we need to diagnose people living with HIV and get them on treatment as soon as possible. In order to do this, Viet Nam must take additional measures to reduce stigma and discrimination related to HIV. And during the transition from international to domestic funding, UN organisations and the international community will continue to provide policy and technical assistance as Viet Nam transitions to a more efficient and more sustainable phase of its national response to HIV. Regarding the shift pattern in the mode of HIV infections, it is true that there has been a gradual increase in the percentage of new HIV infections through sexual intercourse. However, injecting drug use remains the most important mode of transmission in Viet Nam. Ministry of Health data shows us that men still account for about two-thirds of new infections, and most of those infections are from unsafe injections. Among women, 15 per cent who tested positive for HIV reported that their only risk was a male sexual partner who injected drugs. This shows us that many of the HIV infections through sexual transmission are linked to drug-use. Some people call this ""intimate partner transmission"" or ""secondary transmission"". This only emphasises that we need to focus on the primary sources of new infections â€“ drug injection, sex work and male-to-male sexual intercourse. The Government of Viet Nam has taken some bold steps to address these issues more effectively. The National Assembly made a decision to stop sending sex workers to five centres. The Government is working to shift more rapidly to community-based and voluntary drug treatment services. All of these brave efforts are facilitating greater access to HIV services. Viet Nam is an emerging regional leader on these issues. UN organisations would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam for this and encourage additional focus on HIV services that are proven to be effective and focus on the populations in greatest need. Dinh Thi Thanh Ba, director of Do Son medical centre, Do Son District, Hai Phong City Dinh Thi Thanh Ba Since the first case of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam was reported in 1990, Hai Phong City has consistently been listed among the 10 provinces with the highest HIV incidence. That is why donors have so far implemented a lot of prevention and care programmes in Hai Phong. This has contributed remarkably to the positive outcomes of the citys efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. The rates of new infections and AIDS-related deaths have been on a downward trend from their peak in 2003. Since the first case of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam was reported in 1990, Hai Phong City has consistently been listed among the 10 provinces with the highest HIV incidence.

The rates of new infections and AIDS-related deaths have been on a downward trend from their peak in 2003. One of the most important legacies of such long-term interventions is that awareness about the disease and knowledge about how to protect oneself from it have found its way into peoples mind-sets. This is strongly demonstrated in Do Son â€“ a coastal resort 20km away from the citys centre. Do Son was notorious as a centre for prostitution and it used to be a hot spot for HIV spreading via sexual transmission. However, now the situation has been reined in due largely to a major change in attitudes and behaviour. According to our field surveillance, the level of condom use among female sex workers is high. Sex workers in Do Son, unlike in other places, are not street prostitutes in the sense that most of them work inside restaurants or karaoke bars and are managed by these shops owners. It might be a surprise to many people that it is the owners themselves that take the initiative to distribute condoms to their sex workers and require them to be used. In some exceptional cases, some prostitutes refuse to have intercourse because their clients do not wear condoms: radical progress compared to just a few years ago. So I think it is safe to say that the component to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS has done its job quite well and it may not create so big a disruption if we scale it down. However, the reduction of international assistance will greatly affect our efforts in the area of providing HIV treatment and care services. As in the case of Hai Phong City, all ARV drugs are provided for free by our development partners. So the top concern here is how we will find alternative resources to keep providing ARV drugs to those in need. The monthly cost of ARV drugs for one patient is about VND300,000 ($14), not including the expenses for a number of blood tests. One solution that has been widely discussed is to list ARV drugs under the medicine that is eligible to be covered by health insurance. We would also like donors to transfer the technology to produce ARV drugs so Viet Nam can manufacture the drugs in Viet Nam to reduce costs. Another concern is how we can continue to make use of well-trained human resources. For example, under many donor-supported projects, a doctor specialising in treating HIV is posted in each health centre for HIV/AIDS patients and receives a salary from the projects. But as many projects are going to terminate by 2015, it is very likely that these experts will be relocated to other workplaces because no one will pay them if they stay. This will be a waste of resources, as those who are trained will not do what they are trained for while there is still a need for experts in HIV treatment. â€” VNS",Opinion,"['drugs', 'international', 'need', 'nam', 'hiv', 'battle', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'infections', 'faces', 'uphill', 'sex', 'treatment']","Viet Nam News reporter Le Quynh Anh spoke to relevant stakeholders on how Viet Nam should move forward.

According to the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, the country began offering Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to people at high risk of contracting HIV, especially gays, in June 2017. Those who are at high risk of contracting the virus can take an antiretroviral (ARV) drug which contains tenofovir every day. When they are exposed to HIV through sex or recreational drug injections, the oral HIV PrEP can work to keep them from becoming infected. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infections in people who are at high risk by up to 92 percent. The pilot project providing PrEP is being implemented in HCM City until September 2018. Its results will be used to formulate national guidelines and financial mechanisms for PrEP provision in the coming time. Besides this, the Health Ministry has scaled up community-based HIV testing services, focusing on 15 cities and provinces with large numbers of HIV infections; and piloted the HIV self-testing in which people can perform a test on a sample of their saliva at community-based institutions. It has also expanded a network of district-based public clinics that provide HIV confirmatory tests in ""hotspots"" like HCM City, Thanh HÃ³a, SÆ¡n La, Ä�iá»‡n BiÃªn, Nghá»‡ An, YÃªn BÃ¡i and LÃ o Cai. This has helped reduce waiting time for results and save costs. The Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control estimates that in the first five months of the year, over 3,500 people tested HIV-positive, 2,000 infected people contracted full blown AIDS and 641 died of the disease, down 11 percent, 21 percent and 34 percent, respectively, from the same period last year. However, 20 cities and provinces in the country saw year-on-year increases in the number of new HIV infections, including HÃ  Ná»™i, TÃ¢y Ninh, YÃªn BÃ¡i, Tiá»�n Giang, KiÃªn Giang, HCM City and PhÃº Thá»�. The number of new HIV infections in HÃ  Ná»™i and HCM City accounted for 25 per cent of the national total. The number of HIV infections among gays has been on the rise since 2013 and unprotected intercourse is still the most common way the virus is transmitted in the country. Many challenges remain for HIV/AIDS control in the country, largely owing to the lack of funding, said Dr. HoÃ ng Ä�Ã¬nh Cáº£nh, deputy head of the Vietnam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control. He said the lack of funding had resulted in ineffective harm reduction interventions and communication, while the number of people receiving Methadone and ARV treatment had only increased slightly. In the remaining months of the year, authorities plan to ramp up communication campaigns on HIV/AIDS control and prevention with the focus on preventing exposure to HIV, early HIV testing, early ARV treatment and inviting more people to join health insurance schemes, Cáº£nh said. The health sector would also increase health workers at HIV ""hotspots"" in remote areas and carry out HIV tests in prisons, he added. â€” VNS",Society,"['despite', 'funding', 'prep', 'viá»‡t', 'vn', 'hiv', 'nam', 'hivaids', 'infections', 'strives', 'risk', 'number', 'reduce', 'shortage', 'health']","Viá»‡t Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in international funding. â€” Photo antt.vnHÃ€ Ná»˜I â€” Viá»‡t Nam has been striving to reduce the number of HIV infections and prevent outbreaks in high-risk communities despite a decline in international funding, health officials say.

At the conference on HIV/AIDS held in Ha Noi, Director of the Ministry of Healths HIV/AIDS Prevention and Fighting Department Nguyen Hoang Long said that HIV infections remained a serious concern, with an average of 13,000 new cases reported last year. Of these, 5,000 had serious health issues as a result and 2,000 died. Long said health staff at ministries and in localities had been assigned to work on HIV/AIDS prevention and response. Thus, about 10 million people were instructed about the epidemic, an increase of three million compared with the previous year. About 100,000 people benefited from antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 40,000 others were given methadone treatment. Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long appraised the health sectors efforts. He also showed concern about the difficulties and challenges the country would face due to international aid cuts. More than 70 per cent of the countrys HIV/AIDS response came from international organisations, but the funds were reduced due to the countrys new middle-income status and the global financial crisis. Long pointed out four key tasks for the year. The ministry would continue implementing the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Fighting to reduce the infection rate to below 0.3 per cent, promote the participation of sectors and organisations in the work, enhance professional activities, and expand the healthcare network to assure the supply of drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment. â€” VNS",Society,"['response', 'aid', 'international', 'difficulties', 'vn', 'hinder', 'hivaids', 'cuts', 'continue', 'prevention', 'efforts', 'countrys', 'cent', 'curb', 'health']","Drug addicted people receive methadone at a HIV/AIDS prevention centre.

""The neighbour asked me to try and eat the soup and told me that health is everything. She didnâ€™t know that I had HIV yet,"" says Thanh. ""Thanks to my neighbour, who helped me regain my confidence in life, I felt a bit better and tried to concentrate on the knowledge and experience I had gained about how to live with HIV during the years I spent taking care of my brother, who was infected by HIV/AIDS."" ""I also know that despite the fact that HIV/AIDS is a dangerous disease, patients can prolong their life if they are willing. I told myself I could not die because I have to feed three children, one of my own and two of my younger sisterâ€™s, who also died,""says Thanh. Since that day, Thanh has redoubled her efforts to help the community fight HIV/AIDS. She originally took up this work because of her family connection to HIV/AIDS, but now as an HIV positive person she feels even more strongly about sharing her experiences and helping other people affected by the disease. ""Many people were shocked when I told them that I have the HIV virus. It was very difficult for me to announce because I feared discrimination and bad behaviour from people, but I thought that telling true stories about what I had to cope with would be the best way to communicate with other people and reduce discrimination. ""Fortunately, the stories about my life have been shared by the community as many organisations know about me and my circumstances,"" Thanh told Viet Nam News. Hand of experience: Thanh takes care of an HIV patient at her house at 46 Luong Su B, in Ha Noi. â€” VNS Photos Doan Tung The Policy and Care, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), invited Thanh to participate in a course which teaches people with HIV/AIDS to assist each other. In August, 2004, Thanh and six other members founded the Hoa Sua Group, with the headquarters at her house at 46 Luong Su B Lane, Van Mieu Street in Ha Noi. The group now has over 100 members. The guidelines of the group call for friendliness and acceptance towards people with HIV/AIDS. The group has attracted many people affected by HIV, who had been without any hope of living a normal life for years. Nguyen Thi Hoa, from the northern province of Bac Ninh, a member of Hoa Sua for the last two years, says she arrived at a hospital in Ha Noi in very weak health, with oedema causing her legs to swell, a high fever, tuberculosis and many other ailments related to HIV. ""After one week, with help from Thanh and the group, my health was much better. The pain and fever were significantly reduced,"" says Hoa, adding that joining the group helped her regain her confidence in life. Another group member ,Thanh Xuan Truong, who got HIV while addicted to intravenous drugs, says he had relapsed into drug use three times and thought he couldnâ€™t recover, but thanks to the Hoa Sua group, his health is better. ""The most important thing for me is my awareness of the disease and my confidence in life. Also, my life experience on how to share sympathy with other patients has been improved,"" says Truong. Another service Thanh introduced was a self-made a medical kit and treatment diagram which she uses to teach group members how to care for themselves. The group also visits and take cares of other HIV/AIDS patients in Ha Noi. Apart from giving consultations over the telephone to patients who are too afraid to be seen by people, Thanh and her group make house-calls. ""On Sundays we often collect used syringes, which are common in the city, in an effort to reduce the threat of HIV/AIDS to the community,"" says Thanh. In addition, Thanh and her group usually cooks a big pot of soup to bring to Dong Da Hospital, which has the largest number of HIV/AIDS patients in the capital. To earn money for the soup and other gifts for the patients, such as moon cakes and square cakes, Thanh has to seek funding from individuals and non-governmental organisations. Hoa Sua is not an official NGO so its operation is based entirely on the work of unpaid volunteers. Thanh and her group also assist patients outside the realm of medical care, opening a shop for male patients to repair motorbikes and teaching female patients to knit wool hats and handkerchiefs. But very few people want to buy products or have their motorbikes repaired by people with HIV, so Thanh often has to sell the items herself, often bringing them to conferences on HIV/AIDS. ""Our products have sold well at these conferences since foreign delegates buy them and wear them on the spot with tears in their eyes,"" says Thanh. At a Danida-funded seminar on HIV/AIDS in the workplace, Thanh and her group moved participants with their personal stories of discrimination towards people with HIV/AIDS. ""HIV/AIDS victims can work to earn a living for themselves. But we often lose our jobs due to discrimination. We want to get support and co-operation from other ordinary people and organisations,"" says Thanh. Thanh admits that she is often deeply affected by her work caring for patients with HIV/AIDS, often unable to eat after a particularly gruelling day. ""I sometimes think â€˜I will stop the work next timeâ€™ but my love for the patients win. I return to take care of them again and again."" Many delegates to the seminar said that it was the first time they have had direct contact with people suffering from HIV/AIDS. ""These patients are not devils, they are people like us. They have the right to work and to live as other ordinary people,"" a delegate said. Thanhâ€™s efforts have paid off and many more people have joined the Hoa Sua Group. She is calling for further assistance from local and foreign communities and organisations so the group can operate more effectively. According to the Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and Social Affairs more than 129,000 people had been infected with HIV by June 30 this year. â€” VNS",Sunday,"['sua', 'fights', 'patients', 'awareness', 'thanh', 'raise', 'hiv', 'care', 'hivaids', 'victim', 'hoa', 'life', 'group', 'work']","Thanh, founder of the Hoa Sua Group, which offers help and support to people living with HIV/AIDS, has been HIV positive for almost five years.

Since Viet Nam still experienced discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients, the project is all the more important, the director said, promising his departmentâ€™s support for the project being carried out by Marie Stopes International Viet Nam (MSIVN). Lauding the HIV/VCT work done earlier by MSIVN and their experience in treating patients, Dr Nguyen Duc Anh said, ""Our patients feel more comfortable and face no discrimination at MSIVNâ€™s HIV/VCT programme."" Other than HIV/VCT, MSIVNâ€™s clinic also provides other services such as reproductive health counselling and treatment, benefiting female patients, the doctor said. Anh added that sex workers, especially those working the streets, required this service more as they travel frequently and have no other facility to check for HIV/AIDS and treatment. Such clients, who have the potential for spreading the disease, would find the clinics safe. VCT project spreads across region Other than Viet Nam, the Mekong Regional HIV/VCT Project is being carried out in Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand from 2006 to 2008 with the aim to develop, introduce and scale up a holistic and flexible model for integration of quality HIV/VCT into existing clinics, targeting the poor in the three countries. In Viet Nam, the project targets Ha Noi, Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Binh Duong provinces, and will provide effective access to VCT services and facilitate emotional, social and medical support for clients who test positive for HIV. The European Commission is the main sponsor for the 2.6 million euro project, providing 90 per cent of the project cost with 10 per cent coming from MSI. â€” VNS Dr Om Chhorvoin, the projectâ€™s regional director, said they would carry out the service not only at the MSIVN but also in other clinics to serve the clients. Together with China and Indonesia, Viet Nam is a nation with a high growth rate of people having HIV/AIDS among groups such as addicts, prostitutes and homosexuals. According to Viet Namâ€™s Department of HIV/AIDS, there are over 100,000 people having HIV/AIDS, including more than 17,000 AIDS patients and 13,000 newly-infected cases. Nga said though Viet Nam had reported a reduction in newly-infected cases from 17,000 in 2002 to 13,000 in 2005, the country was still at risk if no effective control was in place. Relevant agencies could not even update the count of HIV/AIDS patients in Viet Nam as many were not aware if they were carrying the disease, rendering the fight against the dreaded disease more complex, Nga said. ""Our current figure may represent only one third of the real patients,"" he said. The MSIVN clinic would remove the inhibitions of patients who refuse to go to specialised HIV/AIDS testing centres for the fear of being discriminated.

The project, which was launched in January 2009 and wrapped up this month, aimed to empower HIV/AIDS and migrant children and their families to effectively participate in local life. Run by the Save the Children foundation, the project targeted migrant children in northern Quang Ninh Province, HCM City and southern Ca Mau Province. Part of the work involved training more than 200 child leaders to participate in policy-making to advocate for the rights of HIV-affected and migrant children. Nearly 50,000 children took part in information and education activities under the project. Pham Phuong Dung, 12, living in Quang Ninh Provinces Cam Pha District, was one of the projects beneficiaries. Dung was born HIV-positive and her parents died from AIDS when she was still a child. Her 65-year-old grandmother, Tran Thi Phuong, became Dungs main caretaker. Being ashamed about their family situation, Dung and Phuong rejected all social activities and help from others. Phuong was worried that if someone knew that Dung had AIDS, her life would be ruined forever. It wasnt until Dung and her grandmother joined the project in 2009, that they received much-needed support. The project not only provided Dung with essential nutrition such as rice, oil and milk, as well as a bicycle to go to school, but also opportunities for playing, networking with people who are in the same situation, and taking part in various events that promote childrens rights. Pham Van Nghia, 28, a volunteer worker for the project, said he changed his understanding of the challenges faced by children living with HIV. ""There should be more and bigger forums, with more children and adults attending,"" said Nghia.

Elders care for families torn by HIV,Seventy-three-year-old Nguyen Thi Mai (not her real name) smiles to hide her deep sadness.,[],2008-10-07,vietnamnews.vn,"Elders care for families torn by HIV (08-10-2008) by Hong Thuy The Womenâ€™s Union in Cao Thang Ward, Ha Long City in the northern Quang Ninh Province set up club to give financial support to 67 members. Hoang Thi Dac (left), whose two sons are addicted to drugs and infected HIV/AIDS, have received VND5 million in aid. â€” VNA/VNS Photo Nguyen Dan HA NOI â€” Seventy-three-year-old Nguyen Thi Mai (not her real name) smiles to hide her deep sadness. ""What can I do?"" the 73-year-old woman replies to a question about whether her meagre income is enough to feed her HIV-positive son. ""I earn VND25,000 (US$1.5) a day selling lottery tickets which isnâ€™t enough to buy food"" Mai says, ""It is already hard enough to make ends meet, not mention affording medicines for my son."" Maiâ€™s husband died early, leaving his wife and two children behind. Her daughter is serving a life sentence in prison. Life would be much more difficult for Mai if she could not share her pain with other peers at the empathy club for the elderly. More importantly, the club lent her VND2 million ($121) to buy a heater for her grand-daughter to open a small hairdressing shop in 2006. ""The club encourages me to work for a living,"" Mai said, recalling how she had found nowhere to borrow VND20,000 when she was penniless. Her neighbours were too scared to talk with her and it was impossible to borrow money from them. HelpAge International, a non-government organi-sation, knows the dire straits Mai and other old people like her face, especially those responsible for family members living with HIV/AIDS. The organisation, in collaboration with the Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union, has helped 1,394 old people in 67 empathy clubs borrow money to increase their income. There are approximately 3,300 club members in Ha Noi, Thai Nguyen, Nam Dinh and Quang Ninh. Most of them have used the loans to open small business like outdoor rice and pho stands. Many raise pigs and farm tiny plots of land. Like Mai, many borrowers are elderly citizens whose children are living with HIV/AIDS and/or have to take care of orphaned grandchildren. ""The loan is small but it is a great encouragement to my family,"" Mai said. Thanks to the loan her granddaughter doesnâ€™t have to spend her entire income buying medicines for her uncle. The lucky ones However terrible her situation might be, Mai is one of the lucky ones. According to the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly, many more elderly need to borrow money or their family members will die. But the existing regulations are a hurdle of red-tape barring the elderly from accessing credit loans. ""Most organisations refuse to provide loans to the elderly impacted by HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, except the HelpAge International,"" said a senior official at the Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union who asked not to be named. According to the director of the Viet Nam Association of the Elderlyâ€™s Economic Affair Board, Le Van Nhan, the problem would be solved if the association was allowed to play its role as a guarantor for the elderly to borrow loans. Under the existing regulations, only socio-political organisations like the Womenâ€™s Union, the Farmersâ€™ Association, the War Veteranâ€™s Association, and the Fatherland Front Committee have the credibility to guarantee loans without putting up collateral assets. The Viet Nam Association of the Elderly is merely a social organisation, so it cannot play its role as a trustee, according to Social Policy Bank Director Ha Thi Hanh. Hanh claims that the bank exists for the poor, and does not differentiate between old and young. Yet according to Nhan, the elderly can only take out loans with the help of their children or other organisations. The Viet Nam Association of the Elderly, meanwhile, could help old people to both access credit loans and pay off the debts. If only they were granted the power. Facts have shown that all elderly people borrowed money from the HelpAge International have been able to clear their debts. There are about 8.3 million old people in the country. The number of elderly impacted by HIV/AIDS is not available as no survey about the issue has ever been conducted. UNICEF and other international organisations place the number at 300,000. According to government statistics, Viet Nam has 129,715 people living with HIV, 26,840 people with full blown AIDS and a total of 39,664 people have lost their lives. According to a survey by the Viet Nam Womenâ€™s Union last year, about 74 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDs who responded to the survey were being taken care of by their parents or grandparents, 68 per cent of them by their mothers and grandmothers. Findings from another survey conducted by the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly among old people who had a HIV/AIDS victim in the family found that 82.6 per cent of these elderly had to care for between one to three family members. While old people have affirmed the important role they play in caring for their children living with HIV/AIDS, the official policies do not take care of them, not mention support their affected children.",Society,"['womens', 'families', 'care', 'hiv', 'nam', 'mai', 'elders', 'torn', 'viet', 'association', 'hivaids', 'living', 'union', 'old', 'elderly']","Elders care for families torn by HIV(08-10-2008)by Hong ThuyThe Womenâ€™s Union in Cao Thang Ward, Ha Long City in the northern Quang Ninh Province set up club to give financial support to 67 members.

She is playing the role of a prostitute also infected with HIV, in a new film by director Vinh Khuong. â€” File Photo HCM CITY â€” Pham Thi Hue, featured in Time magazines issue about Asian Heroes in 2004, has just wrapped up the shooting of a new film in which she stars as an HIV-infected prostitute. The film director Vinh Khuong said Hue was the worlds first HIV-infected person to play such a role. In the film, Hue, 31, plays the role of Thu who struggles to live with the disease and, at the same time, bring up her mentally ill younger sister. They both live in HCM Citys Binh Hung Hoa Cemetery. In the film, her sister, after being raped by a group of boys, runs across a railway track in a panic and is hit and killed by a train. Unable to bear the loss, Thu jumps off Binh Loi Bridge with the hope that she can reunite with the souls of her mother and sister. Wandering on the land of the earth, the ghost of Thu witnesses the life of a deaf and mute 70-year-old man, who was formerly rich. She realises that even wealthy people are not happy if they are greedy or selfish. ""The film focuses on spiritual issues and is a new way of disseminating information about HIV/AIDS prevention that helps people live fuller lives,"" Khuong said. Khuong said it took him seven years to collect funds and an additional two years to find actors for Sieu Thoat (Salvation). ""Some actors initially hesitated to act with a person with HIV,"" Khuong said. ""However, the humane script of Sieu Thoat finally persuaded them."" ""After shooting the last scene, Hue was hospitalised for a week. I am really touched by her efforts,"" Khuong added. Human dignity Once wealthy, the old man in the film becomes disconsolate after his son dies in an accident. His daughter-in-law then commits him to an institution for the insane. But he runs away because he cannot stand the loneliness there, and eventually becomes a pauper, living in a deserted temple. He makes a living by fishing plastic bags out of the river and sometimes finds dead bodies. The man prays for the souls of the bodies, including Thus, whose body he finds. A boy, orphaned and living on the streets, is also featured in the film. He threatens the old man, but the man helps him to become enlightened. ""By interweaving the lives of these three characters, the film aims to highlight the endurance of human dignity amid the confines of a cold and rigid society,"" Khuong said. ""Weve done the movie in HD technology, and needed about US$100,000 for post-production so we can widely distribute this at home and abroad,"" Khuong said. The film is expected to be released next month. Most of the revenue from the film will be given to children infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. HIV crusader Like a number of young women in the northern port town of Hai Phong, Hue was infected with HIV by her husband who was addicted to drugs. Her son was born in 2001 was not infected with HIV. In 2002, the 22-year-old tailor and mother of a baby son told her story to the public at a seminar on HIV/AIDS discrimination in Ha Noi. Her business suffered and her neighbours insulted her, but Hue became the public face of Me va Vo (Mothers and Wives), an HIV/AIDS support group established in Hai Phong by Norwegian NGO Nordic Assistance to Viet Nam (NAV) and the Hai Phong Peoples Committee. Hue manages the Hoa Phuong Do (Red Flamboyant) Cooperative which was established in 2003 as a meeting place where hundreds of people with HIV/AIDS come to share their hardships, get medical check-ups and other services to enable them to lead a healthy life. The cooperative runs a garment workshop in Kien An District, generating jobs for 15 HIV-infected people. It also operates a farm raising Geoduck clams on Cat Ba Island. Despite being busy, Hue spends some of her time taking part in contests on HIV/AIDS prevention. In 2006, she won a first prize with ""Happiness in Your Hand"" organised by the Viet Nam Red Cross Society and the Viet Nam Writers Association. She has been invited to speak at workshops on HIV/AIDS run by the Viet Nam General Confederation of Labour, the Ministry of Public Security and other organisations. She has also been presented with a certificate of merit by the Hai Phong Peoples Committee. Khuong said Hues true-life story had partially inspired the film and that her real-life tragedies had ""harmonised with the protagonists"". He also plans to make a documentary about Hues devotion to the local HIV/AIDS community. A graduate of the Film and Theatre College in 2006, director Vinh Khuong received support from the UNESCO Centre Cinema and Multimedia Company and Champa Resort to make the movie.

The event drew the participation of more than 3,500 representatives of State agencies, international organisations and local students. Speaking at the launching ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said that over the past 20 years, Viet Nam gained many successes in HIV/AIDS prevention, including lessons on how to cope with the disease and take control over it. He asked local authorities to continue creating favourable conditions for people to take part in activities to prevent and fight against HIV/AIDS so that no new HIV-infected cases will be reported. Phuc, who is also Chairman of the National Committee Against AIDS, Drugs and Prostitution, called on all local leaders and residents to continue raising awareness of HIV/AIDS prevention. State officials and cadres should be pioneers in the HIV/AIDS prevention campaign, with all families and social organisations taking care to support HIV infected people and reduce discrimination against patients, he said. He also called on international and non-Government organisations to join with Vietnamese people in taking more drastic measures against HIV/AIDS. Minister of Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien said the national action month against HIV/AIDS aimed to draw attention and increase community responsibilities. The programme was expected to raise awareness of the most vulnerable people living in remote and disadvantaged areas, as well as focus more attention on ethnic minority people, she said. In 2010, Viet Nam curbed the rate of HIV infections to 0.26 per cent of the population, lower than the target of 0.3 per cent set in the National Strategy of HIV/AIDS prevention. With this success, Viet Nam became the country with the lowest rate of HIV infections in the region, Tien said.",Society,"['action', 'national', 'awareness', 'nam', 'hiv', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'prevention', 'dinh', 'local', 'month', 'organisations', 'launched']","A health worker gives advice to a young couple about HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases in northern Nam Dinh Province.

Building programmes and policies on HIV/AIDS education and prevention at the workplace has become increasingly necessary and returned benefits to the enterprises that implement them. Statistics of the Viet Nam Confederation of Labour show that nearly 700 cases of workers with HIV/AIDS have been reported nationwide. ""Itâ€™s a fact that many enterprises are fully aware of the danger of HIV/AIDS before it appears in their workplace,"" said Dang Hoa Ai, director of the confederationâ€™s Centre for AIDS Prevention. ""But once a worker is found to have contracted HIV/AIDS, then there is discirmination towards him."" Information at a recent workshop co-ordinated by the labour confederation, the Academy for Educational Development, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA), and the Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, shows that the impact of HIV/AIDS can reduce labour productivity and increase production expenses. Heroine of Asia Pham Thi Hue, who joined the workshop as a representative of people living with HIV/AIDS, said that she and many other workers with HIV/AIDS always felt hurt when other people misunderstood that mere infection with the HIV virus means the victim is unhealthy or unable to work. She recalled many stories of discrimination towards them in reality. ""I hope that managers will give their workers more opportunities to learn about HIV/AIDS so that they can protect themselves and do not have the wrong impression of the condition."" Hue urged the expansion of the SMARTWork project, commenting that it would help reduce the number of HIV infections as well as ensure the rights of victims in the worksplace. The SMARTWork project, funded by the US Department of Labour, is an educational programme on HIV/AIDS implemented in six countries worldwide: the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Ukraine, Nigeria, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. Begun in 2003, the project was extended in June 2004 when US President George W Bush decided to support 15 countries in his US$15 billion emergency action plan for AIDS relief in which Viet Nam was the only Asian country selected. The project has been implemented in Thai Binh, Hai Phong, Quang Nam, Ba Ria-Vung Tau, Dong Nai and HCM City. The project partners with MoLISA and has so far trained about 6,000 people in HIV/AIDS prevention while over 33,000 workers have become beneficiaries of the project. Four additional provinces of Vinh Phuc, Quang Ninh, Hai Duong and Hung Yen are also committed to join the project. Patrick Burke, project co-ordinator of SMARTWork Viet Nam, said that the porject achieved many successes in its first three years of implementation. ""The main reason is that we receive the co-operation of the Government, who does not ignore the problem and are always willing to take part to help our work be more effective,"" he said. ""Also, the commitment of the companies weâ€™ve worked with are also an advantage when we implement the project."" Burke said that, among their plans, they had worked with a manufacturer in the US to produce 30 condom machines for about $190 each. When the machines arrive, they will work with a manufacturer in HCM City to produce more machines at cost of $120-130 each.",Society,"['smartwork', 'project', 'combat', 'moves', 'nam', 'machines', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'labour', 'workplace', 'aids', 'prevention', 'workers', 'work']","AIDS combat moves to workplace(25-07-2005)by Hong MinhHA NOI â€” HIV/AIDS can no longer be viewed as merely a problem of drug users and prostitutes as it affects all of society, including workers, enterprises and their families.

Earlier yesterday, the president of the Union of Friendship Associations, Vu Xuan Hong, presented Ryan with the ""For Peace and Solidarity Between Peoples"" insignia at a ceremony in Ha Noi. Hong expressed appreciation for the UN representativeâ€™s tireless effort and contributions to both international goals and Viet Namâ€™s socio-economic development, poverty reduction and the fight against epidemics. He wished Ryan success in his new position as assistant to the UN secretary general and as Annanâ€™s special representative in Liberia. Jordan said he was honoured to receive the insignia, and added that he would use the valuable experience he gained in Viet Nam in his work in Africa. The same day, the Science and Education Commission under the Viet Nam Communist Partyâ€™s Central Committee also bestowed Ryan with a medallion in recognition of his contributions to science and education in Viet Nam during the ceremony. The honour is usually awarded only to scientists and managers of at least 20 years standing for their contributions in science and education. Viet Namâ€™s appreciation of Ryanâ€™s contribution is shown by the fact that he has been in the country for less than nine years. These were the years when the United Nations and other donors had their biggest number of development support programmes in the country, said Science and Education Commission chairman Do Nguyen Phuong. They had helped with economic, legal and administrative reform, natural resource management, environment protection, poverty alleviation, human development training and technology transfer, he said. HIV/AIDS project The United Nations Development Programme and Swedenâ€™s International Development Authority have pledged more than US$1.97 million to help Viet Nam fight HIV/AIDS. The intended project had stemmed from a Ryan idea as well as his friendly sentiment to the Vietnamese people before the immeasurable danger of HIV/AIDS. Viet Nam will contribute about $269,000 for the three-year project that will be financed by the money in northern Lang Son Province; central Khanh Hoa Province and southern An Giang Province. The renewed commitment by the two international aid agencies is embodied in a new agreement they signed with the Science and Education Commission in Ha Noi yesterday. The two will provide more than $1.97 million to help the Partyâ€™s leaders, ministries and agencies co-operate for the successful implementation of the national HIV/AIDS prevention and control strategy to 2010. It will be the first time that the Science and Education Commission and the Partyâ€™s Ideology and Culture Commission have collaborated with provincial Party commissions in a HIV/AIDS protection and prevention project of more than $2 million. ""Itâ€™s an honour because it shows their belief in us,"" said Science and Education Commission chairman Do Nguyen Phuong at the signing ceremony. ""But it also poses a big challenge."" Outgoing UNDP residential representative Jordan Ryan said effective leadership in mobilising the entire society was needed to defeat the epidemic. The personal involvement of leaders was also critical to the successful realisation of political commitments and policies so as to achieve such concrete results as: Reducing stigma and discrimination; Promoting the greater involvement of all including people living with HIV/AIDS and affected by HIV/AIDS in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and, Providing greater access for all people to quality information, education, and communication for behaviour change; treatment and care services.",Society,"['commission', 'nam', 'honoured', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'ryan', 'outgoing', 'development', 'science', 'united', 'nations', 'official', 'education', 'insignia']","Outgoing UN official honoured with insignia(15-12-2005)Party leader Nong Duc Manh (right) shakes hands with outgoing United Nations resident co-ordinator Jordan Ryan.

HCM CITY (VNS) â€” A 21-year-old man from the Mekong Delta province of Vinh Long reluctantly left his family to move to HCM City after his parents discovered that he was gay. In the city, he became a male prostitute. Since then, he says: ""I seem to have fallen into hell."" One day, he met a man who belonged to one of the citys 14 community-based organisations supervised by the LIFE organisation under the Viet Nam Union of Science and Technology Association. The member of the M for M group gave him a condom and told him that he should receive free HIV testing at the consulting centre. At first, he was very angry but later he decided to visit the centre for the test. ""I was shocked to discover when I tested positive for HIV. I felt overwhelmed and fearful. Why me?"" he said. He called the member, who told him to go to an HIV outpatient care and treatment clinic in the city. The man also taught him how to prevent HIV transmission. Now that he has had treatment, the Vinh Long native feels that being HIV-positive is not a death sentence. ""My life started again when I joined the M for M group,"" he said. Nguyen Van Hoang, another member of M for M, said the groups members used many methods, including social networks to access gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) to spread knowledge of HIV-transmission prevention and provide condoms. They also work with medical facilities, with assistance from the citys AIDS Prevention Centre, to treat MSM or gays with HIV, and with local authorities to enhance prevention activities in the community. This year, the group accessed 1,247 MSM and gays. Of them, 538 were sent to the citys free HIV testing and consulting centre, he said.

Speaking at a conference today that summed up the initial results of HIV testing in the community and created a plan for the future, VÃµ Háº£i SÆ¡n, an expert from the administration, said discrimination was the main factor keeping people from approaching centres to get tested for HIV. Many of the people suffering from HIV lived in remote areas with a difficult terrain, so travelling to centres for tests was difficult, he said. To address the problem, the administration ran a pilot programme for HIV testing in six provinces and cities, Nghá»‡ An, Thanh HÃ³a, Ä�iá»‡n BiÃªn and ThÃ¡i NguyÃªn, as well as HÃ  Ná»™i and HCM City, in the 2015-17 period. It plans to expand the programme to districts with a high population of HIV sufferers in the 2017-20 period. Under the pilot programme, a number of activities were conducted. Medical workers provided mobile HIV tests in the community. Village-based medical workers and community organisations offered consultancy services on HIV tests. Training was given to the communesâ€™ medical workers. The people receiving the tests included heroin addicts, their spouses and children, sex workers and homosexuals.

In the northern province of ThÃ¡i NguyÃªn, 234 people were tested, and nine of them tested positive and had anti-retroviral therapy.

The Viet Nam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) reported that out of 12.8 million employees, which represents 14.6 per cent of the total population and 28.2 per cent of the labour force, approximately 5,000 are drug users and 1,000 have contracted HIV. However, several officials and experts acknowledge that the realistic amount of drug users and HIV cases are much higher than what has been reported. ""If there was not such a high number of people on drugs or infected with HIV, productivity would increase and we would save a considerable amount of money,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Truong Vinh Trong. ""The drug abuse problem among staff and workers in our country is getting more and more serious with around 5,000 employees using drugs and more than 1,000 infected with HIV,"" said VGCL Vice President Hoang Ngoc Thanh. The remarks were made at a conference, which focused on policies related to HIV, drugs and prostitution prevention, in Quang Ninh Province last weekend. The conference, hosted by the National Committee of HIV/AIDS prevention and drug and prostitution control, was attended by the committeeâ€™s chairman Trong, representatives from ministries, international non-governmental organisations, provincial Peopleâ€™s Committees, provincial confederations, national trade unions, economic groups and enterprises. Attendants at the conference all agreed that HIV/AIDS prevention was a national concern that could not be addressed without long-term engagement with the business community. ""We are aware that enterprises play an important role in HIV/AIDS prevention and drug and prostitution control,"" said chairman of Nam Trieu Ship Building Companyâ€™s Labour Union Nguyen Van Canh. Participants also acknowledged that drug addiction should be treated as a disease that could potentially affect anyone, and therefore individuals who struggled with addiction should not be discriminated against by the community. ""Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease that requires long-term treatment, which takes into consideration the biological, social and psychological aspect of the whole person,"" said advisor on drug abuse Kevin Mulvey. UNAIDS country director Eamonn Murphy said as many as nine out of 10 people living with HIV were adults in their most productive years. Two out of three people living with the disease go to work everyday. Studies have shown that people who receive treatment are more likely to have happier, healthier and more productive lives. He said HIV was a work-force issue and that the key populations at high risk in Viet Nam were of working age. Eamonn added that what was good for communities was good for business. A healthier labour force generated more spending power and a more developed economy. Therefore, effective HIV prevention helped to prevent production losses. Speaking at the workshop, business leaders were aware of the losses HIV had caused to their companies, as well as to the communities. Pham Minh Tuan, an employee at Ha Tu Coal Joint Stock Company in Quang Ninh Province, had previously been hopeless about the future due to his drug addiction. ""In 1992, I began using drugs. My job, life and family were seriously affected by my addiction. I was sure that I was going to lose my job,"" Tuan recalled. However, he was not dismissed and received support from his company to undergo treatment at a drug detoxification centre. After being treated, he was offered another job at the company as a driver. In time, he was able to regain the trust of his co-workers and was later nominated to be the head of the companyâ€™s driving team. Tuan now has a happy family and is actively contributing to the companyâ€™s development. Not everybody has been as lucky as Tuan. According to Deputy PM Trong, Viet Nam now has 350,000 enterprises with millions of workers and civil servants.

""We canâ€™t live in the past while we are struggling for our lives in the present,"" T. said. BFG is one of 13 groups in the Bright Future Network, with over 600 members who are people living with HIV/AIDS in the north. The group sells and provides at no cost more than 15,000 condoms to local motels and restaurants each month. BFG is now participating in a pilot project preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS in Duc Giang and Bo De communes in Long Bien District, Ha Noi. The programme, called ""Inns with condoms,"" has been running for nearly a year. Around 20 hotels in Bo De and a dozen in Duc Giang are BFG clients. However, delivery of condoms is only allowed under the pilot programme. Other hotels near those inns still refuse to buy condoms from the group, or buy them on the sly. H., a BFG member, said that they began to market condoms to hotels several years ago but their message was not welcome, because of a high degree of ""vigilance"" among hoteliers. Many people think that condoms are considered â€˜forbiddenâ€™ in hotels in Viet Nam, because they can be used as evidence of prostitution. ""They drove me away when I brought condoms to their hotels, even though I knew that they often bought condoms from shops. They were afraid that I was an informer or secret police officer. Now they call me for condoms,"" H. said. Both authorities and the public support the idea of publicly delivering condoms to hotels as a tool to prevent the spread of HIV, which has killed more than 10,000 and threatens nearly 100,000 Vietnamese people. ""In my opinion, it will be best to legalise condoms in hotels. However, according to a draft of the decree that guides how to implement the new Law on HIV/AIDS, condoms may only be allowed in places approved under the framework of the anti-HIV/AIDS prog-ramme,"" Deputy Director of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Health Nguyen Huy Quang said.",Society,"['law', 'restaurants', 'fight', 'nam', 'condom', 'living', 'hivaids', 'viet', 'noi', 'aids', 'condoms', 'group', 'allowing', 'hotels', 'sales', 'programme']","New law to fight AIDS by allowing condom sales at hotels, restaurants(10-08-2006)by Thanh HaiChinese Movie Star Jackie Chan (standing centre) talks with HIV/AIDS sufferers at Phap Van pagoda, Thanh Tri District, Ha Noi, during his visit to Viet Nam in 2005.â€” VNS Photo Gia Vi.

Centre helps beat addictions,"Five years ago, Nguyen Huu Viet, a HIV-positive drug addict, went to the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in the northern province of Hai Phong.",['Minh Thi'],2011-06-22,vietnamnews.vn,"by Minh Thi HIV/AIDS patients take their meal at the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in Hai Phong City. The cash-strapped centre is struggling to cope with an influx of drug addicts. â€” VNS Photo Minh Thi HAI PHONG â€” Five years ago, Nguyen Huu Viet, a HIV-positive drug addict, went to the Centre for Social Education and Labour in Thuy Nguyen District in the northern province of Hai Phong. Viet said that he was then a ""terrible person"", a robber who stole to feed his addiction. Today, Viet is rebuilding his life and is now the director of a small private company. ""On the ridge between life and death, I now realise that life is priceless, and that I must make every effort to say no to drugs,"" he said. He urges addicts at the rehabilitation centre, also known as the Gia Minh Centre, to try their best to give up drugs, despite enormous temptations. ""Drugs will deprive you of your youth and blacken your names,"" Viet tells them. He is among the few addicts at Gia Minh who have fully managed to give up drugs. Pham Anh Hai, the centres deputy director, said the proportion of people who relapse after leaving rehabilitation centres is 80 to 90 per cent. The high percentage is among the many challenges facing the centre. At a meeting to commemorate the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on June 26 organised last Saturday by Hai Phong Communist Youth Union and Vietnam News Agencys Journalists Association, Nguyen Quang Toan, Gia Minh Centres director, said that treating addicts was difficult as no cures or procedures had been outlined. The centre also has to cope with limited financing . The Governments food subsidy for addicts was recently lifted from VND240,000 to VND360,000 ($17) per person per month, but this was still low considering the current high inflation rate, Hai said. Additionally, funds to buy personal belongings for inmates is only VND100,000 a month. The centre currently offers treatment to more than 1,200 people. Seventy per cent of addicts have criminal records and 50 per cent suffer from HIV infections. Of those with HIV, nearly 30 per cent also have AIDS. To manage them, there are only about 20 medical staff - and most of them are quite young. Hai, the centres deputy director, said that many of the staff left because of work pressure and of the high risk of HIV infection. On occasion, newly admitted addicts desperate for a ""fix"" became violent with staff in their attempts to escape. Lai Thi Hien, a nurse in her early twenties, once had scissors pressed under her neck by an addict. Nguyen Thi Trang, Hiens colleague, was once slashed on the hand by an addict. She lived in fear for days after the incident. ""I was very scared and cried a lot,"" said Trang. Despite all difficulties, they stay committed to their jobs. But some families do not want their daughters to remain on the job. ""My family do not want me to stay in this environment because they are very worried about the infection risk,"" said Nguyen Thi Phuong, who has been working at the centre since its establishment in 2004. Toan said the centres staff were gladdened when some of their patients managed to give up drugs. Vu Duc Cuong, 28, who went to the centre in 2006 and only recently succeeded in giving up drugs, said he wanted to settle down and find a good job and a wife. It was difficult because of social discrimination and the prevalence of drug sellers near his home, he said. Like Cuong, dozens of the centres patients who managed to give up also want to rebuild their lives. Some stay at the centre, helping with the treatment of HIV-positive patients or making handicrafts, traditional medical remedies and pottery.

Representatives from the ministry attended Saturdays ceremony marking the 2012 National Action Month of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Combat. Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long said the number of new HIV cases annually rises above 10,000. He added the number of cases caused by unsafe sexual activities has increased, which meant that more women and children risk getting the virus. Punishing people who are most at risk simply doesnt work â€“ it doesnt reduce drug use, it doesnt reduce sex work and it doesnt reduce HIV, according to Tony E.Lisle, country director of UNAIDS Viet Nam. He argued that drug users need clean needles and evidence-based treatments for drug addiction. Sex workers need condoms, regular health checks and protection against exploitation. ""Many of these individuals are rejected by society for committing so-called ""social evils"". And when society rejects them, it is very difficult to reach them with health care and social services.

Almost half of all HIV patients in Viá»‡t Nam get treatment allowing them to enjoy a longer and productive life and take care of their families, she told a conference on policies for HIV/AIDS prevention held in HCM City yesterday. â€œThis means that more than half of people with HIV who very much need treatment do not get it.â€� With still around 11,000 new HIV infections and 8,000 AIDS-related deaths every year, Viá»‡t Nam continues to face a major public health threat, she said. â€œThough every new HIV infection is preventable, especially mother-to-child transmission, every year a few hundred Vietnamese infants are born with HIV.â€� Young peopleâ€™s knowledge of HIV remains limited, and thus the younger generation, whom Viá»‡t Namâ€™s future relies on, is still much at risk of HIV and progress could be reversed, she warned. The HIV epidemic and response are uneven across the country and, evidence shows, have become more serious in certain areas and among some key populations, she said. This complex dynamic requires continued determination and a well-adapted response, she said. â€œInvesting in the HIV response will not only ensure that no one is left behind and at risk without access to HIV information and services, but will also enable more people living with HIV to be part of the national solutions towards ending AIDS.â€� Viá»‡t Nam would be able to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, she said. â€œThough we will continue to support Viá»‡t Nam to mobilise external support, in the context of fast reduction of donor funding for HIV due to Viá»‡t Namâ€™s strong economic development and with a view to further ensure the sustainability of the HIV response, HIV should be integrated in the national and provincial socio-economic development plans.â€� Nguyá»…n HoÃ ng Long, head of the Viá»‡t Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said in the first six months of this year 4,541 new HIV infections had been detected, raising the total number in the country to 209,591. Of them, 56 per cent are getting the anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy, he said. The total number of AIDS patients is 90,190. Nine provinces and cities are yet to complete a project on allocating finance for HIV/AIDS prevention, he said. It is expected that health insurance would cover ARV drugs from 2019, and the ratio of people with HIV/AIDS who have insurance increased from 64 per cent last February to 76 per cent in June, he said.

Ä�am made the call during a meeting held in the northern province of Háº£i DÆ°Æ¡ng yesterday in response to the National Action Month for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control (November 10 â€“ December 10) and World AIDS Day (December 1). The UN 90-90-90 Goals mean that by 2020, 90 per cent of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90 per cent of all people with a diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, while 90 per cent of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression. In his speech, Ä�am said HIV/AIDS epidemics appeared for the first time 35 years ago, and was discovered in Viá»‡t Nam 25 years ago with 250,000 infection cases and over 90,000 deaths reported so far. Thanks to efforts of departments, agencies and organisations, HIV/AIDS infections and deaths have fallen in recent years. On top of international support, the Vietnamese government will allocate more budget for the fight against the epidemic and issue health insurance for HIV patients, the Deputy PM noted. Viá»‡t Nam is the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to commit to the UN 90-90-90 Goals, he said, adding that awareness campaigns should be enhanced to make it easier for HIV carriers to be treated with ARV and protect them from discrimination. According to the Health Ministryâ€™s Viá»‡t Nam Authority of HIV/AIDS Control, the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS reported that there are more than 36.7 million living HIV carriers now and around 35 million have died of the disease. 2017 is the 10th consecutive year that Viet Nam has seen decreases in the number of newly-discovered HIV infections, the number of transmissions to full-blown AIDS and the number of AIDS-caused deaths.

The VNP+ said it and other organisations in the region were aware that the US had declared war on generic AIDS medicines through free trade negotiations with countries in the region. It expected the prices of medicines for HIV, TB, hepatitis C and other major diseases to increase as a result. At the seventh round of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) negotiations which wrapped up in HCM City last week, the US had taken intellectual property demands beyond what had been agreed under the WTOs Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the VNP+ said. Do Dang Dong, national co-ordinator of the VNP+, said the drug prices would rise because under IP rules, all countries would have to import them from manufacturers, mostly American. The negotiations which came barely 10 days after the United Nations High Level Meeting on HIV and AIDS in New York where all countries including the US committed to ""ensure that intellectual property rights provisions in trade agreements do not undermine these existing flexibilities, as confirmed by the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health."" The Vietnamese generics industry, with support from the Government, was taking the lead in providing affordable treatment for hepatitis-C, Noah Metheny of the Thai AIDS Treatment Action Group said. However, US drug giant Roche is challenging Viet Nams generic production of pegylated interferon and now the TPPA negotiations are threatening to impose even greater legal barriers that may prevent similar attempts by the country to ensure generic production of key medicines,"" according to Metheny. Dong said:""I wonder if President [Barack] Obama and Secretary [Hillary] Clinton realise that the US trade representative is currently demanding that Viet Nam change its laws in ways that would prevent affordable generic production of new AIDS medicines."" For many HIV-positive drug users in the Asian region who also have hepatitis-C, Viet Nam offers the best hope for supplying generic pegylated interferon, the costly medicine used to treat hepatitis-C, according to the VNP+. Pegylated interferon has been patented in India and Indian generic companies are reluctant to produce it. The TPPA negotiations will not only make it difficult for Viet Nam and Malaysia to emulate the Indian example, they will in fact mandate that these countries grant patents on small changes made to existing medicines. Peter Maybarduk of the US group Public Citizen agreed: ""The US seems obsessed with maximising intellectual property and favouring the big drug companies, even if it leads to low-quality patents that do nothing for innovation and block access to lifesaving treatment.""

The demand for loans among these people is high, with nearly 86 per cent having expressed the need, but added they are often hampered by prejudice. Also, they have to struggle to find work in the face of workplace discrimination. The statistics come from a new survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA). Seven provinces and cities throughout the country were canvassed, including Ha Noi, HCM City, Nghe An and Can Tho. The survey received nearly 1,550 responses in July this year from former drug addicts, sex workers and people affected by HIV, including those with HIV or a spouse, parent or child of those with HIV. Le Duc Hien, deputy director of the Department for the Prevention of Social Evils, said the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs will draft a decision for a policy to increase access to loans for people from these vulnerable communities and submit it to the Prime Minister for approval within the year. Hien said helping people from vulnerable groups was very important as it would not only directly help these people but also help their families improve their lives and help to contribute to the common social order and community development. ""They must not be left alone,"" he emphasised. Accessing vocational training and finding stable jobs was another major issue for the respondents, with nearly 58 per cent stating a desire to receive vocational training, but only over 14 per cent said they had been offered help in seeking training or finding jobs. The MOLISA survey reveals that just over 7 per cent of the survey respondents are university graduates, while the rest had only graduated from high school or lower levels. An anonymous respondent to the MOLISA survey said that having a history of being a drug addict in the past, he found himself a very unattractive candidate for companies offering work. ""Vocational training schools and companies give us many excuses for not accepting us,"" he said. While nearly 70 per cent of respondents said they are working, only 18 per cent of them earned VND3-5 million (US$140-240) a month and 57 per cent earned only VND1-3 million ($47-140). Because of poor health, lack of professional experience, limited educational background and their own sense of inferiority, respondents said they preferred doing seasonal jobs and freelancing (39 per cent) or decide to start a small businesses (56 per cent). Only 13 per cent said they wanted to work for a company as a full time employee. According to a report by the Department for Prevention of Social Evils operating under MOLISA, social discrimination, limited educational background and sometimes poor health are reasons making these groups find it difficult in accessing finance to rebuild their lives. The report also highlighted the Government only has a policy to offer loans towards poor households and there is no specific policy to offer loans towards these vulnerable groups. While the risk of offering loans to the groups seems high, MOLISA survey revealed that in reality, over 79 per cent of those who successfully borrowed loans had also managed to repay the loans. The Department for Prevention of Social Evils said support from both local and central Governments and from social organisations should be increased to help such vulnerable people. The support should be made through a range of measures such as promoting empowering legal policies, increasing professional consultation, raising job placement activities, promoting media coverage to reduce social discrimination and promoting access to loans for vulnerable people. The Department added that the Viet Nam Bank for Social Policies, which was responsible for offering financial support towards special groups of people, must work to create a more favourable and helpful environment at a local level for those from vulnerable groups. â€” VNS",Society,"['social', 'reintegration', 'molisa', 'work', 'drug', 'vulnerable', 'cent', 'loans', 'groups', 'hinders', 'help', 'prejudice', 'survey']","The demand for loans among these people is high, with nearly 86 per cent having expressed the need, but added they are often hampered by prejudice.

Community sites help drug addicts access treatment services,"Five pilot sites in the city were set up with staff who have professional and technical training offered by the cityâ€™s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs and the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI).",[],2019-01-05,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€“ A 51-year-old former drug addict in HCM Cityâ€™s District 1, who has been receiving a daily methadone treatment at a local health centre, now has a stable income as a motorbike taxi driver. The man, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he received treatment from the District 1 Health Centre thanks to advice from a Community Consulting Site in the districtâ€™s Pháº¡m NgÅ© LÃ£o Ward. Methadone, a synthetic opioid, can be used to treat severe pain or opiate addictions, especially addiction to heroin. â€œI was addicted for many years. I visited addiction treatment centres many times, but always relapsed,â€� the man said. He began receiving assistance from the Community Consulting Site in early 2016 from its social workers who work as volunteers. Another man, a 58-year-old from District 8, who tested positive for HIV, has also received support from a local Community Consulting Site. In September 2016, he returned home from the PhÃº VÄƒn Addiction Treatment and Social Welfare Establishment in BÃ¬nh Tháº¡nh District, but became more ill. â€œAt that time, I was very afraid of returning home because of my disease,â€� he said. In 2017, he contacted the Peopleâ€™s Committee in District 8â€™s Ward 8 where a Community Consulting Site is located. He later became a volunteer at the site. He has encouraged other drug addicts and people with HIV/AIDS to visit the site for consultations and treatment. The consulting sites in District 8â€™s Ward 8 and District 1â€™s Pháº¡m NgÅ© LÃ£o Ward are two of five pilot sites in the city with staff who have professional and technical training offered by the cityâ€™s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs and the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI). The SCDI is an NGO that aims to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable populations, including drug users, sex workers, and PLHIV (people living with HIV), their partners and their children. The staff at the consulting sites are knowledgeable about hepatitis C, health insurance, and methadone. Between 2017 and 2018, staff and volunteers at the five sites provided consulting to 879 people and free health insurance cards to six people. They persuaded 42 addicts to accept community-based treatment and introduced 72 other addicts to methadone treatment at health centres in the city. They also helped 22 former addicts find jobs and six others to access loans totalling VNÄ�110 million (US$4,746), and connected local sponsors to help support addicts with financial difficulties. Huá»³nh Thanh Khiáº¿t, deputy director of the cityâ€™s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, said the cityâ€™s community consulting sites play an important role in reducing the number of addicts brought to addiction treatment establishments. â€œThe city plans to reduce the number of these addicts by 6 per cent by 2020,â€� Khiáº¿t said, adding that the city has nearly 12,000 addicts being treated at these establishments. Of these, 70 per cent live in the city. â€œThe cityâ€™s total number of managed addicts is more than 18,000,â€� he added. Nguyá»…n Tuáº¥n Anh, deputy head of the cityâ€™s Social Evils Prevention Division under the department, said that his division would work with local peopleâ€™s committees to allocate funds for these community consulting sites so they can improve their operations. â€œThe city now has 125 community consulting sites,â€� Anh said.

Early intervention can prevent HIV spread,"Early intervention and treatment can almost completely prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, a workshop heard in Vung Tau on Monday.",[],2012-12-26,vietnamnews.vn,"BA RIA-VUNG TAU (VNS)â€” Early intervention and treatment can almost completely prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS in Viet Nam, a workshop heard in Vung Tau on Monday. If pregnant women with HIV get early access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, the transmission rate would be zero per cent, Assoc Prof Dr Bui Duc Duong, deputy head of the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control, said, This means their babies would be healthy like normal ones, he told the workshop that reviewed a project on HIV/AIDS Prevention in Viet Nam funded by the World Bank. Generally, early intervention and treatment would curtail transmission by 96 per cent, he said. For this, more information would need to be disseminated to help people understand that being infected with HIV is not a death sentence, he added. A report by the administration showed that the number of new HIV-infected people has reduced since 2007, going down from 30,846 to 17,780 last year. In the first nine months of this year 8,560 people tested positive. As of September the number of people living with HIV was 206,435. Of them 59,206 have AIDS while 62,073 have so far died of the disease. Dien Bien Province continued to top the country in the ratio of HIV-infected people, with 992.8 per 100,000 population. It was followed by HCM City with 665 and Thai Nguyen Province with 579. In the last five years the number of HIV-infected people aged between 30 and 39 nationwide has been on an upward trend. Last year they accounted for 43 per cent of newly infected people. There has been an increase in the ratio of sexual transmission in the first nine months of this year to 46.4 per cent from 42.3 per cent last year. Most of the incidence was in the Cuu Long (Mekong) River Delta and the south-eastern region. Infections transmitted through blood fell to 41.3 per cent from 46.2 per cent last year, and was mostly found in the northern region. New infections among men who have sex with men have been rising in the last two years. Duong warned of the high risk of HIV infection among ethnic minorities, but said it was difficult to prevent in northern mountain provinces like Dien Bien, Lai Chau, and Lao Cai because of peoples habit of giving themselves opiate shots to relieve pain. More than 69,880 people with HIV use ARV. This number is likely to double by 2015. ""The steady decrease in new HIV infections is a result of assistance from international organisations like the World Bank,"" Duong said.

All sectors should co-operate with each other to prevent such discrimination, said Landon Kuester of Alpert Medical School of the US-based Brown University. Sharing experiences on education for addicts in rehabilitation centres as well as for former drug addicts, Landon said biased behavior would undermine efforts to minimize the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as efforts to help former drug addicts reintegrate into mainstream society. Being ostracized by the society will make people living with HIV/AIDS depressed, isolate them from the community and break relationships with their own families and community, he said. They lose their desire to continue treatment, worsening the situation, he stressed. Experts called for more effective activities and programmes to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS that would dispel irrational beliefs about the disease and how it spreads. Healthcare policies should ensure equality in accessing treatment for all segments of the society, they added. In schools, teachers should educate students on how to access accurate information on HIV/AIDS and work to prevent prejudices against people living with the virus. At workplaces, managers should create many chances for people living with HIV/AIDS to work and encourage fellow employees to welcome them into their fold.

""The number of patients is limited by the Ministry of Health regulations. Those who want the medicine free must meet specific conditions,"" said Le Van Thanh, director of the districtâ€™s Preventive Medicine Centre. Under the regulations, HIV patients can access the medicine when they move to the fourth stage â€“ the diseaseâ€™s most serious period. At that stage patients have lost more than a tenth of their weight and suffer prolonged fatigue and diarrhoea from unknown reasons. They spend more than 15 days a month in bed and have had other conditions such as pneumonia, brain disorders, fungus infections and oesophagus problems, Thanh said. International organisations supply ARV medicine, the specific remedy for HIV/AIDS patients. Most who meet the conditions have moved to a serious stage of AIDS, and with their serious problems the treatment meets resistance. Most HIV/AIDS sufferers are afraid of public opinion while patients who want the medicine must reveal their identity and go under supervision at hospitals, Thanh said. Because of the requirements, many patients donâ€™t seek hospital treatment. ""Another reason is that it costs nearly a million dong (US$55) for tests before patients are supplied with ARV medicine. Most are poor,"" Thanh said. Moc Chau District, in the northern mountainous province of Son La, is a disease hot spot. The first HIV case was diagnosed in 1999.

Statistics have not been compiled on sex-workersâ€™ numbers but the centre provides more than 100 with free condoms, said Thanh.

The early treatment will be offered in all medical units, including private ones, to 2,500 patients, or 20 per cent of the total number of HIV/AIDS patients, by the end of 2015. The aim is to have early ARV treatment to cover 90 per cent of infected persons by 2025 in order to eliminate all cases in the 2025-30 period. The number of ARV patients is expected to reach 26,000 by 2015, from an estimated 23,000 patients in 2013. By 2015, the average number of patients per outpatient clinic is expected to be between 600 and 1,000. This year, at least 5,200 patients were newly registered at more than 30 outpatient clinics and nearly 3,000 patients were given ARV treatment. HIV/AIDS prevention in HCM City has received 90-93 per cent of its financial support from international organisations. However, such support is expected to fall, but the need is still high, which poses challenges for HIV/AIDS-prevention activities in the city, she said. Le Truong Giang, chairman of the HCM City Public Health Association, said that funding for HIV/AIDS prevention programmes would rely on the State budget, health insurance and private funds, as international aid is falling sharply. Funding resources should be used efficiently, Giang said, adding that funding from the Government and international organisations must be focused on activities for target groups, such as pregnant women, high-risk people and patients infected with hepatitis and tuberculosis. AIDS activities for other targetted groups will be assisted by private sources of support. ""Expanding HIV counseling and testing to detect HIV-infected cases early is the first action to end the spread of the disease here,"" Giang said. HIV-infected people ""live with HIV, but die by co-infection"", he said, adding that harm-reduction intervention should be targetted at those people with the highest behavioral risk.

The Asia Development Bank will support the project with an additional $550,000. Launched last month, the five-year project was expected to bring direct benefits to young people in high-risk groups including drug users and prostitutes. The projectâ€™s first phase would be carried out in Cam Khe District and the city of Viet Tri, areas with the highest concentration of people living with HIV. As of December, the province reported 1,181 people living with HIV, of whom 267 had progressed to symptoms of AIDS and 198 have died. There have been 121 new cases reported this year. However, due to the limited provincial budget, only about 4,000 people in high-risk groups are tested each year. Ngo Khang Cuong, director of Education and Communication Department under the National Committee for Population, Family and Children, said the project would bring more opportunities for people living with HIV/AIDS to find employment, as well as lessen community discrimination. Cuong, who is also director of the project, said, ""Society must not only express sympathy but also create conditions for them to have job. . . . Their bravery and optimism in life along with the communityâ€™s support all is a strong hedge against discrimination."" At the launching ceremony, the chairwoman of the National Committee for Population, Family and Children, Phan Thi Hanh Nguyen, noted that the province had the second-largest population among the eleven provinces of the northeastern region and great potential in commerce, tourism, services, and cultural exchanges. However, she said, it was faced with the dangers of the spread of social evils, including HIV/AIDS. Drug addicts using needles account for fully 79 per cent of HIV/AIDS cases in the province, but experts worried that there was an increasing trend of people contracting the virus through sexual intercourse. Compounding the problem was a provincial unemployment rate of 7.6 per cent, equivalently to about 14,300 persons out of work, many of them young people, the highest-risk group for engaging in behaviours that may result in HIV infection, said Nguyen. The province has an increasing migrant population, as well, with 25,000 arriving annually to seek work, eight per cent in the 18-30 age group.

HCM CITY â€” HCM City has achieved great success in combating HIV/AIDS in the two decades since it reported the countrys first case, but more efforts are needed, a health official said. Speaking at the opening of a photo exhibition depicting the fight against HIV at the Youth Cultural House on Saturday, Dr Le Truong Giang, deputy head of the HCM City AIDS Committee, hailed the efforts to protect people from the disease. Giang, who is also deputy head of the city Department of Health, said that in 1995 WHO had warned there would be 200,000 people with HIV in HCM City in 2000. ""But now, a decade later, the city only has around 40,000 patients and around 8,000 people have died since 2000,"" Giang said. ""After 20 years of combating the disease non-stop, we have achieved great success in preventing its spread in the wider community,"" he said. The city has a programme to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to their unborn children. ""In Viet Nam only in HCM City is it successful, with 150 children saved each year,"" he said. The free anti-retroviral treatment offered to every HIV/AIDS patient has also been very successful, helping save an estimated 10,000 patients from possible death, according to Giang. In the early days of the epidemic, the fatality rate was pretty high, with 2,000 people dying as recently as five years ago. But the number has now fallen to 600 a year. Though the rate of infection among drug users and sex workers peaked in 2001 and 2002 at 80 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, Giang admitted that drug use and prostitution remained a problem, with drug users appearing to get younger. HIV transmission between men who have sex with men was becoming a great concern and this group would be the focus of the citys upcoming campaign, he said.

VN-American swaps body building for community building,"Amazin LÃªThi, a former professional bodybuilder with a global career spanning over 20 years, has shifted her focus to community work, hoping to",[],2017-04-13,vietnamnews.vn,"by Há»“ng VÃ¢n Amazin LÃªThi, a former professional bodybuilder with a global career spanning over 20 years, has shifted her focus to community work, hoping to ""give back"" some of what she got over the years from her native and adopted countries and communities. LÃªThi is the first internationally published Vietnamese health and fitness author, advocate for the rights of HIV/AIDS patients and global ambassador for Athlete Ally and Viá»‡t Nam Relief Services. No longer competing as a natural bodybuilder, LÃªThi is now focusing on the entertainment, health and fitness industry, and her community work. â€œMy great passion is giving back to my community by utilising my different skills,â€� she tells Vietnam News. By July, LÃªThi will launch a flagship sports, education and leadership programme in Háº£i PhÃ²ng city for LGBTQ youth and kids affected by HIV/AIDS. The programme is co-organised by her local partner HIV/AIDS advocate Pháº¡m Thá»‹ Huá»‡, the US and Dutch embassies, as well as businesses and organisations. â€œThe main premise of this is creating an opportunity for kids to have fun, given that they all have difficult lives, learn necessary life skills and business skills for them to be connected with businesses locally and globally so that we can fast track them on educational and career development,â€� said LÃªThi. She hopes the programme will be launched nationally by 2018. â€œThe LGBTQ movement has progressed so much in the last six years, but LGBTQs are still the most marginalised people. It is important that Viá»‡t Nam have a global voice and that its stories are shared so that the global community does not forget our stories and our needs,â€� said LÃªThi. LÃªThi has been engaged in community work for over twenty years. In the US, she has been involved in activities with the Asian American and Vietnamese community. In 2014, LÃªThi was the first international HIV advocate invited to Italy to speak at a national conference about AIDS in the Asian community. LÃªThi also advised the White House Initiative on Asian American Pacific Islanders, and on Asian youth issues that include discrimination of LGBTs, bullying and racism. This year, LÃªThi and her organisation became advisors to the New York City Department of Education and LGBTQ Advisory Council on Asian youth issues. She is also due to give three keynote speeches this year to amplify the Asian voice in New York, Chicago and Atlanta, where she has also been collaborating with the state and city on Asian youth issues. Asian youths globally are bullied the most out of all ethnic groups, and LGBTQs are bullied the most, according to LÃªThi, who points out that people tend to pick on people with weaknesses or those different from the majority. ""As a society, we donâ€™t really understand about these marginalised people, what itâ€™s like to feel different within yourself,"" she says. â€œSo I will work hard on awareness.â€� Raising a voice on these issues, helping such youth find work, empowering them to be leaders - this will help to shift them from being barely tolerated to being accepted, she believes. Empowerment mission LÃªThi is a transracial adoptee, spending some time in Australia and now dividing hert ime between Europe and US. â€œBeing an Asian living in a foreign community, I suffered lots of bullying, both verbally and physically in school and in society. â€œWhen I was small, the Vietnamese in Australia had a bad image. Our community lived in a bad part of town and I was always told we were thieves, drug dealers and the only reason Asian youth travelled to the richer areas of town was to steal from people. â€œYet people had no idea Vietnamese parents worked very hard to send their kids to better schools abroad so they could have a decent education,â€� she says. Considering sports as ""an amazing social platform bringing people together"", LÃªThi decided to pursue bodybuilding at the age of six. â€œSports isnâ€™t based on what one looks like but how good an athlete one is. It gave me confidence to stand up to bullying in school and a sense of community,â€� said LÃªThi. â€œAs a leader and a woman, I think of myself when I was six. I didnâ€™t have any female role model, a Vietnamese role model to look at. And now Iâ€™m in a position, on a global platform, where I can be a role model for a six-year-old somewhere. â€œYoung Vietnamese girls need to have a role model in the community so they know who they want to become, who they can be, and more importantly, that their dream is valid. It is important to let them know that belief is possible so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m always advocating for girls to make sure they get access to education,â€� said LÃªThi. In 2015, LÃªThi launched her organisation, Amazin LÃªThi Foundation at Vietpride with the mission to empower and inspire the most vulnerable citizens. Specifically, the organisation worked with LGBTQ youth and those affected by HIV/AIDS through a range of educational, sporting, leadership and mentoring programmes, as well as to campaign against social stigma and discrimination. â€œThe organisation is my own vision to give back to the Vietnamese and global community,â€� said LÃªThi. A heart towards motherland She first came back to Viá»‡t Nam over a decade ago. LÃªThi has travelled back to Viá»‡t Nam every year since, and sometimes four times a year. â€œI had tears of joy as the plane was landing. I truly felt like I was coming home, and everytime I arrive back home to Viá»‡t Nam I have that same feeling. â€œIâ€™m so proud of my Vietnamese heritage and culture, and can now see there are many amazing Vietnamese female leaders in our community, and Iâ€™m honoured to be one of them,â€� LÃªThi says. LÃªThi is in the process of searching for her biological parents. â€œEveryday I think of how proud they would be to know what I have achieved in my life and the person I have become. â€œThe struggles that I have gone through in my life shaped me into the person I am today. This is why I use my platform to inspire, empower and educate Vietnamese youths, encourage them to believe in themselves and their dreams so that one day they can be leaders and mentors in their community,â€� LÃªThi sums up.

War veteran is angel to City AIDS mothers,"Whenever social worker Truong Ngoc Nhu hears about the delivery of a baby to a mother infected with HIV, she immediately visits her district's hospital to counsel the mother, explaining that she should never breast-feed the child.",[],2015-03-11,vietnamnews.vn,"Well known: Truong Ngoc Nhu (firs t on right), a social worker with the HCM City AIDS Prevention Committee, speaks with residents in her ward about HIV prevention methods. â€” VNS Photo Gia Loc by Gia Loc HCM CITY (VNS) â€” Whenever social worker Truong Ngoc Nhu hears about the delivery of a baby to a mother infected with HIV, she immediately visits her districts hospital to counsel the mother, explaining that she should never breast-feed the child. A former war veteran, Nhu is head of Ward 21s Phat Tam HIV/AIDS Prevention Division in HCM Citys Binh Thanh District. As part of her job, she gives advice to mothers about HIV transmission prevention at the districts Gia Dinh Peoples Hospital. Babies born to mothers with HIV are tested for HIV one month after delivery. They are then given another test four months later, said Nhu, who works for the citys AIDS Prevention Committee, considered to be the most effective in the country, according to the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control. After delivery, the babies are given the HIV medicine zidovunine, but if results from the two tests show that HIV has been transmitted, they will receive another type of drug that will help them live healthier lives. Nhu, 61, a native of Long An Province in the Mekong Delta region who moved to the city in 1990, is well-known for her devotion and care of people with HIV or AIDS. She began hearing about people and children with HIV/AIDS living in the ward when she was a member of the Womens Union in Ward 21. One young man, she said, was rumoured to have HIV, so she contacted the family to encourage him to take tests. As a result, the son was willing to go to the hospital, where he tested positive for HIV with a low CD4 cell count, the type of white blood cells that fight infection. He was immediately provided anti-retroviral ARV treatment, and is now healthy and married, Nhu said. After she introduced many of these local residents to the citys anti-retroviral ARV treatment programme, the citys HIV/AIDS Prevention Committee offered her training as a social worker. She began to work for them in 2008. A resident with HIV who lives in Nhus Ward 21 calls Nhu a ""lifebuoy"". ""I was worried when I became pregnant, and I didnt know if I should have an abortion. So I met Nhu for counselling and she persuaded me to take part in the citys programme on prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission,"" Nguyen Thi Thanh Thao, who has HIV, said. ""Thanks to her counselling, my son tested negative for HIV,"" Thao said, who now works in Nhus HIV prevention division. The Peoples Committees in her ward and district have honoured Nhu with medals for her contributions to HIV prevention. Along with official recognition, people with HIV/AIDS in her ward often send messages to express love and thanks to her, motivating her to continue counselling people with HIV. Nhu said that a few women with HIV had wanted to abandon their newly delivered babies. ""I encouraged them to keep the babies,"" she said. But some of the mothers cannot be convinced. Nhu said on a trip to visit relatives in Vinh Long Province, she received a call from a woman at Gia Dinh Peoples Hospital in HCM City. She had just delivered a baby and wanted Nhu to find a welfare centre for the newborn. Though Nhu urged her to keep the baby, the mother said she could not afford to raise the child. Still in Vinh Long, Nhu called the HCM City HIV/AIDS Prevention Committee, which gave her the name of Tam Binh Welfare Centre for children with HIV/AIDS in HCM City. As soon as she returned to HCM City, Nhu visited the centre to check on its quality.

Healthcare sector strives to control epidemic,Healthcare sector set measures to fulfil the targets set for this year along with warning of medical experts on drug resistance situation of the country,[],2019-01-16,vietnamnews.vn,"HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€“ This year, the healthcare sector aims to reduce death rates caused by diseases and epidemics to increase life expectancy. That was the key objective discussed by the healthcare sector during an online conference held on Tuesday. The sector would focus on improving capacity and performance to help develop a fair, effective, quality and sustainable system to meet high demands of people. This year, the sector has to fulfill two targets set by the National Assembly and the Government of ratio of 2.7 hospital beds per 10,000 persons, and 88.1 per cent of people buying medical insurances, heard the conference. In terms of preventive healthcare activity, the sector would strive to achieve early detection and control epidemics to reduce death rates by infectious disease as well as closely supervise and prevent infectious plagues at international border gates to avoid disease coming into the country. It continued to make efforts to ensure safe vaccinations with the rate of 95 per cent of children vaccinated, ensure adequate vaccine supply, and develop different types of vaccination services for people. The Health Ministry plans to co-operate with the Education and Training Ministry to enhance capacity of school clinics, supervise school hygiene and control school-related diseases. Testing activities to detect HIV-infected people would be expanded and focus on key areas and high-risk groups in prisons and mountainous areas through community-based and at home HIV testing. The sector strives to discover about 8,000-10,000 cases of HIV this year. The HIV/AIDS treatment would be improved and distributed to 140,000 patients, and provide ARV medicine to the grassroots clinics. The sector would continue to mobilise financial resources for HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities, and expand treatment through medical insurance. Measures to reduce overcrowded hospitals and increase quality of healthcare services would be a priority. This yearâ€™s objective includes food safety inspections at both production and retail levels. Indiscrimination use of antibiotics In the meeting reviewing the national action plan on drug resistant prevention held on Monday in HÃ  Ná»™i, deputy Minister of Health Prof. Dr. Nguyá»…n Viáº¿t Tiáº¿n warned that indiscriminate drug use and the purchase of drugs without prescription would contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance which caused harm to the whole community. â€œThe leading cause of drug resistance came from buying and selling antibiotics so easily and without doctorsâ€™ prescriptionsâ€�, Tiáº¿n told the meeting. ""Viá»‡t Nam is in a group of countries with a high rate of antibiotic resistance, even worse than many countries,â€� the deputy minister said. Using drugs without doctorâ€™s instructions had many risks, including multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria which has been spreading from one country to another threatening human health, said Tiáº¿n. In order to overcome the antibiotic resistance, Prof. Dr. Tiáº¿n said each person should raise awareness about effective use of drugs, including antibiotics, for themselves and the community as well as follow doctorsâ€™ instruction and prescriptions. In addition, it was necessary to raise the responsibilities of those who are entitled to use drugs including doctors and pharmacists to strictly control the prescription and drug sales, the doctor said. Meanwhile, Prof. Dr. LÆ°Æ¡ng Ngá»�c KhuÃª, head of the Medical Examination and Treatment Department, pointed out six main reasons for the drug resistance situation in Viá»‡t Nam. Those were unreasonably prescribing antibiotics with too low or too high doses or not depending on microbiological test results or prolonged uses; patients using antibiotics without prescription; misuse of antibiotics in aquaculture; inadequate infection control in health facilities and farms; lack of proper plastic waste disposal facilities; and the lack of new invented antibiotics. Work on drug resistance prevention has exposed weaknesses including lack of co-operation, limited awareness of the community, health and agricultural workers to drug resistance is generally limited and modest capacity of the microbiological system, said KhuÃª. â€“ VNS",Society,"['antibiotics', 'doctors', 'drug', 'control', 'including', 'resistance', 'epidemic', 'strives', 'sector', 'drugs', 'health', 'healthcare']","HÃ€ Ná»˜I â€“ This year, the healthcare sector aims to reduce death rates caused by diseases and epidemics to increase life expectancy.

Hepatitis C screenings target high-risk populations,People at risk of contracting hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be able to access more convenient testing options and information through a new initiative launched yesterday in HCM City.,[],2018-02-03,vietnamnews.vn,"HCM CITY â€” People at risk of contracting hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be able to access more convenient testing options and information through a new initiative launched on Thursday in HCM City. The community-based HCV/HIV intervention project increases access to HCV screening, diagnosis and treatment for high-risk populations in the city. Under the project, which will end in October, a total of 5,000 people at risk will receive HCV information, and 2,500 clients will have HCV rapid diagnostic testing, said Tráº§n Thá»‹ HÆ°Æ¡ng LiÃªn, project coordinator. The testing, which is available at community-led private clinics, only requires a small amount of blood from the prick of a finger. Ninety per cent of HCV-reactive clients will receive confirmatory testing and counselling on treatment options, LiÃªn said. Although up to 4 per cent of the population in Viá»‡t Nam are exposed to HCV, and from 29 to more than 90 per cent of populations with higher risk, such as people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men, are exposed to HCV, only a small proportion with the disease know they are infected, according to Kimberly Green, PATHâ€™s programme director for HIV, tuberculosis, and non-communicable diseases in Viá»‡t Nam. Only a vastly reduced proportion of those diagnosed with HCV have access to and complete entire course of treatment, she said. This is despite the fact that HCV is curable and newer direct acting antivirals are available that can treat HCV early in the course of disease and prevent morbidity and early death due to cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer, she added. However, with rapid point-of-care testing, and lower-cost, direct-acting antivirals that are pan-genotypic and can be used for all HCV genotypes, the opportunity to identify, treat and work towards eliminating HCV are stronger than ever before, Green said. Similar to HIV, the HCV virus is spread through the blood or body fluids of an infected person through unprotected sex or shared needles.

AIDS Day a reminder of long road ahead,"Following World AIDS Day on December 1, people are reminded that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow, with concern that some countries are seeing a resurgence in infection rates which were previously stable or on the decline.",[],2006-12-08,vietnamnews.vn,"Outlook (08-12-2006) AIDS Day a reminder of long road ahead by Nguyen Thu Hang Following World AIDS Day on December 1, people are reminded that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow, with concern that some countries are seeing a resurgence in infection rates which were previously stable or on the decline. According to the latest figures from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organisation, an estimated 39.5 million people are now living with HIV, with 4.3 million new cases this year. Some 2.9 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2006. The diseaseâ€™s spread was most noticeable in East and Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. AIDS is set to join heart disease and stroke as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since the first case was reported in 1981, making it one of the most destructive illnesses in history. ""In a short quarter of a century, AIDS has drastically changed our world,"" UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said. According to a recent UNAIDS report, young people between 15 and 24 account for 40 per cent of new infections worldwide. ""Even in countries where the epidemic has had a very high impact, such as South Africa, general awareness is still worryingly low,"" said Karen Stanecki, UNAIDS epidemiologist. Decline of HIV infections in most East African countries and the impact of better access to treatment gives rise to hope. Sub-Saharan Africa still bears the highest burden, with 63 per cent of the worldâ€™s infected people. Condom availability and other safe sex programmes have helped curb the infection rate with some countries showing early success, such as Uganda. Challenges In many countries, HIV prevention programmes are still not reaching the people most at risk, such as youths, sex workers and their clients, drug users, and ethnic minorities. New data also shows that HIV prevention programmes are failing to address the overlap between drug use and sex workers in Latin America, Eastern Europe and particularly Asia. Levels of safe sex and HIV knowledge remain low in many of these countries, as well as the perception of personal risk. China and India, where ignorance of the virus is rampant, are feared to be on the brink of an explosive HIV growth. According to the UNAIDS report, there are almost 8 million people with HIV/AIDS living in south and southeast Asia. India has the worldâ€™s largest number of HIV/AIDS cases in a single country, with 5.7 million cases. When Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) leaders met in Ha Noi on November 18-19, they agreed to enhance co-operation on HIV/AIDS, and expand efforts toward combating the spread of the disease. The leaders also want to ensure the rights of those living with the disease are protected. One of APECâ€™s long term goals is to ensure the United Nationsâ€™ declared goal of universal access to medicine, treatment, care and support by 2010 is achieved. Combating AIDS in Viet Nam Like many other countries in Southeast Asia, Viet Nam has reported a number of new cases this year, with HIV spread across all 64 provinces despite Government efforts. On the eve of World AIDS Day, Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet called on all Vietnamese people to actively participate in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and praised efforts by Government and non-government organisations to curb the diseaseâ€™s spread over the past year. ""HIV/AIDS prevention activities should be a top priority in the countryâ€™s socio-economic development. It requires the participation and close co-operation of ministries, organisations and individuals,"" said Triet. ""There is no cure for HIV or AIDS. But if we build community awareness, we can stop this harmful disease from spreading."" During a two-day visit to Viet Nam on Tuesday, Bill Clinton, former US president and president of the Clinton Foundsation for HIV/AIDS, appreciated the Viet Nam Governmentâ€™s in preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS and said his foundation would continue to help Vietnamese women and children fight the disease, and was ready to consider further humanitarian assistance to Viet Nam in other areas. Clinton and Health Minister Tran Thi Trung Chien signed an agreement between the Clinton Foundation and Viet Namâ€™s Health Ministry as the foundation will next year supply medicines to Vietnamese children who suffer from HIV/AIDS. Viet Namâ€™s improving economic conditions has given the country a fighting chance in battling the epidemic, according to experts Dr Le Truong Giang, vice chairman of the HCM City Committee for HIV/AIDS Control, said local and foreign HIV/AIDS agencies have recorded impressive achievements in combating the disease in the past year. Some 40,000 people are infected with HIV each year in Viet Nam, the majority are drug users and persons who buy or sell sex. ""More education is needed to change public understanding about the epidemic as well as its spread,"" said Giang. ""Education should focus on warning people about protecting themselves from the disease."" By 2010, the Government hopes that 95 per cent of youths will have basic knowledge on reproduction, sex education and safe sex practices.",Opinion,"['spread', 'nam', 'hiv', 'day', 'ahead', 'hivaids', 'road', 'viet', 'million', 'aids', 'long', 'reminder', 'disease', 'countries', 'sex']","Outlook(08-12-2006)AIDS Day a reminder of long road aheadby Nguyen Thu HangFollowing World AIDS Day on December 1, people are reminded that the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to grow, with concern that some countries are seeing a resurgence in infection rates which were previously stable or on the decline.

Projects aims to ease AIDS patients' pain,"Feeling wasted, 27 year-old Than Minh Chanh insisted his parents stop spending large amounts of money on anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs every month.",[],2006-12-01,vietnamnews.vn,"Projects aims to ease AIDS patientsâ€™ pain (01-12-2006) by Hong Van Two doctors at HCM City District 1â€™s Health Service Centre carry out a check-up on an AIDS patient. The HCM City AIDS Committeeâ€™s programme to acquire anti-retroviral drugs for patients had benefited more than 3,500 people as of last month. â€” VNA/VNS Photo The Anh HCM CITY â€” Feeling wasted, 27 year-old Than Minh Chanh insisted his parents stop spending large amounts of money on anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs every month. In July 2004, Chanh, who had been a drug addict for three years, discovered he was carrying HIV. The doctors at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases told him the medicine would cost at least VND1.5 million (US$100 then) a month and that he had to take it for the rest of his life. But his parents said that no matter how much it cost, they wanted him to be with them for as long as possible, so in August the same year, Chanh started taking the medicine. Yet, after one year, in September of last year, he realised that financial pressure on his parents was too much and he thought about quitting the programme. One noon in September while he was watching television, he saw a news programme about HIV/AIDS and learned that the city had been carrying out a free ARV programme for people with HIV/AIDS for a month. Even though he had doubts about the programme, he and his father decided to visit the Binh Thanh District Counselling and Community Support Centre. ""Right at the door of the building, I felt comfortable with the centre,"" Chanh said. ""Even the person who watched the motorbikes realised I was new to the centre and offered to show me the way to see the counsellors."" There he met many people like him and learned about the virus he was carrying, AIDS, and the side effects of ARV drugs. He joined the Misa club with other drug addicts and at the clubâ€™s monthly meeting, he and other people talked about different topics, including nutrition, the problems of stigma attached to the disease, and helping other people. ""For a long time I felt so hopeless and wasted,"" Chanh said. ""Now I feel like I still have so much to give to people like me."" Because of his active support, in July Chanh was officially recruited to be part of the Binh Thanh Counselling and Community Support Centreâ€™s peer educator and home-care group. Every day, Chanh and other people in his group visit high-risk groups, such as drug users and sex workers, to talk to them about the risk of getting HIV, provide them with syringes or condoms, and tell them about the ARV programme. Free ARV Programme Sitting in his small office, Doctor Nguyen Thanh Liem, head of the Binh Thanh Centre, said that he was very happy when the free ARV programme was started. Liem said he used to feel helpless and sad when he visited people with HIV/AIDS and saw that most of them had no money to buy food or even medicine. ""When some international organisations came to do research, I had no hope that we would receive free ARV drugs,"" Liem said. ""So when the programme really started in August last year, I was so happy."" At the meeting to review the first year of the free ARV programme, Le Truong Giang, deputy director of health and chairman of the HCM City AIDS Committee, said that one year of ARV drugs for a HIV/AIDS person costs about US$1,300. Even though the AIDS Committee initially targeted to provide free ARV for 2,000 people in the first year, total foreign funding of $3.6 million from Esther, the Global Fund, the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other organisations have benefited more than 3,500 people as of last month. Giang is proud that within a short period of time, his committee and the health department was able to organise the voluntary testing centres, the treatment procedures, the hospitals, the counselling and community support centres, and the peer educators and home-care groups at the district level. While he attributed the full support of the central and city authorities, the Ministry of Health, and his department, Giang noted the active participation of the local healthcare workers and the peer educators. ""The effectiveness of our network allowed us to call for financial, technical and experience support from international organisations,"" Giang said. As a result, Giang said that Viet Nam has been able to curb the spreading rate of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, Giang also admitted that the distribution of syringes for drug users and condoms for sex workers who are high-risk groups for HIV/AIDS is still limited. He also said that to take care of some 40,000 people with HIV, about 20,000 AIDS patients, and an additional 10,000 new cases anticipated each year, more human resources for HIV/AIDS workers were needed than the present figure of less than 1,200 staff. Giang has proposed that the city Peopleâ€™s Committee allow the AIDS Committee to set up an HIV/AIDS research and training centre to provide training courses for HIV/AIDS workers in the city and other southern provinces. Until now, hospital fees and testing charges for HIV/AIDS-infected people who are admitted to hospitals â€“ typically when they have tuberculosis or encounter serious side effects from ARV drugs â€“ are still relatively high. Giang said with the issuance of the Law on HIV/AIDS this year, which will come into effect next year, he thought that state medical insurance should also start paying for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Mother-to-child story While Giang said that next year his committee planned to triple the number of AIDS people to receive free ARV drugs to 8,000 next year, he also set the bar higher. He wants to reduce the rate of HIV/AIDS transmission from infected mother to child to less than 4 per cent among those who take ARV drugs. Giang said that worldwide the average rate of transmission without ARV intervention is 30 per cent, which means of the 700 pregnant women in HCM City last year, about 210 of their newborns would be HIV-infected. But the reported rate from the hospitals is 13 per cent. And for the expecting mothers who take ARV regularly, the rate has been lowered to 4.8 per cent, according to the AIDS Committeeâ€™s report. Besides the free ARV, Giangâ€™s committee has managed to call for funding for free formula for a newbornâ€™s first six months. While the programme is run by the HCM City AIDS Committee, Giang said that half of these women, and 15 per cent of other ARV beneficiaries, are from other provinces. Giang said that the fight against HIV/AIDS has been carried out by many other agencies as well, not just his committee or the Department of Health. At the Tam Binh II House in Thu Duc Districtâ€™s Linh Xuan Ward run by the Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, about 50 health care workers are helping adults in their physical battle, but also doing one of the hardest jobs. These workers, including adult orphans, volunteered to help take care of 96 orphans aged a few months to eight years old who were born to HIV-infected mothers. Those who are only HIV-negative will resume a normal life through adoption or stay at the orphanages. For the house staff, it is always a sad moment when they learn that any baby is HIV-positive. At the centre today, 33 babies aged from 1.5 years old to eight years old are fighting against the deadly virus. Whenever a child shows a lack of appetite or diarrhoea, the staff start worrying. At a meeting with Tea Leoni, an American actress who was on a visit to HCM City last year as a UNICEF Ambassador, some children at the centre told her that they attended school regularly and wanted to become a doctor to be able to cure the disease. At the closing day of the school year, the children also attended a ceremony at nearby Xuan Hiep Primary School where they were given complimentary certificates.",Society,"['arv', 'ease', 'patients', 'projects', 'city', 'giang', 'hivaids', 'workers', 'chanh', 'aims', 'aids', 'pain', 'committee', 'free', 'programme']","Projects aims to ease AIDS patientsâ€™ pain(01-12-2006)by Hong VanTwo doctors at HCM City District 1â€™s Health Service Centre carry out a check-up on an AIDS patient.

Clinics must protect staff from infection,"Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective, local health officials have said.",[],2015-12-21,vietnamnews.vn,"Health workers take care for a people living with HIV. Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective. â€” Photo baohaiquan.vn HCM CITY (VNS) â€” Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective, local health officials have said. At a workshop on occupational diseases held on Thursday in HCM City, Dr Huynh Tan Tien, head of the citys Labour Health and Environment Protection Centre, said that obeying standard precautions was the best way to prevent the infection. Recently, the Ha Noi Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital admitted a patient they did not know to be HIV positive. During emergency surgery, the hospitals 18 doctors and nurses did not wear protective clothing. After four hours of surgery, the doctors and nurses took anti-HIV medications following a World Health Organisation recommendation. Research also shows that between 2011 and 2014, HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases had 428 health officials exposed to HIV, accounting for 56.3 per cent of the total number of fields with staff exposed to HIV, such as police and rehabilitation centres. No one has tested HIV positive. Sharp devices that caused wounds on the skin caused the highest rate (53.9 per cent) of transmission among healthcare staff, police, rehabilitation workers and others who have exposure to HIV, according to the research study. Nurses who injected or took blood from patients with HIV were also at a high risk of exposure. Recommended precautions are frequent hand washing; wearing gloves, face masks and other clothing; proper transport of patients; and treatment of medical waste, Tien said. The precautionary standards should be applied to all patients and health officials, he said. Infections can spread from patients to patients, patients to health officials, or health officials to patients. Under the Ministry of Healths regulation, each hospital is required to have a faculty or team in charge of infection prevention and control. Ha Kim Phuong, specialist of the Medical Examination and Treatment Department, said that after five years of implementation of the circular on guidance for hospital infection prevention and control in health facilities, 13.3 per cent of hospitals nationwide had not set up a faculty in charge of the issue. More than 41 per cent of the countrys total hospitals have no sterilizing units, and 93.2 per cent have not conducted surveys on hospital acquired infections since 2010. Treatment Dr Nguyen Viet Thinh of the city Pasteur Institute said that healthcare staff were also at risk of being infected by hepatitis. Thinh recommended that healthcare staff receive vaccines against hepatitis. Tien said that influenza and tuberculosis were also occupational diseases. Health staff who have contact with hazardous elements in surgery and tests, including contact with people with HIV/AIDS and patients with hepatitis, should undergo testing for occupational diseases within six months after contact, Tien said. Those staff who have contact with infectious diseases and tuberculosis, and work during disease outbreaks, should have examinations within 12 months. A council for medical assessment specifies the level of health decline and labour capacity if the staff test positive for any of the occupational diseases. After the assessment, the staff is treated and examined periodically. When resuming work, the staff are assigned to work in environments that are not considered hazardous or dangerous, Tien said. â€” VNS",Society,"['clinics', 'infection', 'diseases', 'patients', 'hiv', 'officials', 'hospital', 'staff', 'cent', 'protect', 'risk', 'health', 'tien']","Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective. â€” Photo baohaiquan.vnHCM CITY (VNS) â€” Staff at health facilities continue to face a fairly high risk of infections from body fluids, blood or pathogens as protective measures are not effective, local health officials have said.

ARV therapy is now offered at 33 city-level hospitals and district preventive health centres. HCM City and four provinces of Dien Bien, Son La, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa are carrying out a pilot programme, based on targets set by the Joint UN programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) that aims to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030. The UN ""90-90-90"" targets call for having 90 per cent of all people with HIV to know their status by 2020. It also aims to have 90 per cent of people diagnosed with HIV infection to receive sustained ARV therapy, and to have 90 per cent of all people receiving ARV therapy to have viral suppression. The central HIV/AIDS Prevention Department and the citys AIDS Prevention Committee yesterday discussed a detailed plan to achieve the targets. This is especially important as funds from international aid for HIV/AIDS prevention have fallen since Viet Nam is no longer ranked a low-income country by the UN. The committee estimates that according to the targets, the city will have 14,038 more people with HIV to need treatment by 2020. ""This is a big challenge for the city because hospitals and district preventive health centres are overloaded,"" Dr Tieu Thi Thu Van, the committees head, said. The city hospitals and district preventive health centres are treating 27,500 people with HIV. Expanding the therapy to district general hospitals and private health clinics is very important, she said. Van has asked the Ministry of Health to develop specific policies for the city to pay for therapy from a health insurance fund when international funding for ARV drugs ends in 2016. The city plans to manage HIV patients receiving ARV therapy through electronic medical records or phone messages. This will help keep track of the patients and ensure that 90 per cent of them have viral suppression by 2020. The city will also expand the testing network for finding new HIV patients so that 90 per cent of people with HIV will know their status by 2020. Van said that the committee would carry out rapid HIV antibody tests at district health centres. At least 41,841 people with HIV live in HCM City, she said. Dr Phan Thi Thu Huong, the departments deputy head, said the city was seeing a trend of HIV transmission through sex. The risk of HIV transmission through sex among people using amphetamines is now very high, as they tend to engage in unprotected sex under influence of the drug. Huong said that encouraging the use of condoms among this group was difficult. ""It is very important to find these patients and provide treatment,"" she added. Nguyen Hoang Long, the departments head, said that the citys number of patients with HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the countrys total number of HIV patients. HCM City prevention activities greatly influence similar prevention programmes throughout the country, he added. â€” VNS",Society,"['arv', 'patients', 'city', 'fight', 'hospitals', 'hiv', 'expand', '90', 'cent', 'aids', 'district', 'health', 'therapy']","HCM City plans to expand anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy to general district hospitals in an aim to achieve the target of providing treatment to 90 per cent of the city's patients diagnosed with HIV by 2020. â€” VNA/VNS PhotoHCM CITY (VNS) â€” HCM City plans to expand anti-retroviral (ARV) therapy to general district hospitals in an aim to achieve the target of providing treatment to 90 per cent of the city's patients diagnosed with HIV by 2020.

Chanâ€™s visit attempted to curb discrimination against HIV/AIDS victims. He travelled to the northern province of Quang Ninh, which has the highest rate of HIV in the country, to meet with HIV/AIDS patients and to tour the regionsâ€™ treatment facilities. In Ha Noi, Chan met Buddhist monks and nuns at Phap Van Pagoda who provide care and support for HIV-positive children and adults. They also work with young adolescents at a ""healthy living club"" to share personal experiences in combating HIV/AIDS. Le Huong asked Chan about his goals for his short visit. Do you think a three-day visit is long enough to fulfil your mission? No. Discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients has been going on for 15-20 years. Itâ€™s not a one-day job, itâ€™s a long term one. We have so many things to do and everyone should get involved. The press plays the most important role in spreading the news. I need the mediaâ€™s help. You have made a series of films for UN programmes during the trip. Do you think you might return to Viet Nam to work with Vietnamese directors in artistic films? I cannot say if I will return. Yet I promise I will think of something to do for Viet Nam. Last year, I went to Cambodia to witness the landmine situation in the country, and I decided to return to make a film on landmines. Last week I was in Aceh (Indonesia), and I realised that I should organise an international charity concert (to raise money for the locality). I donâ€™t have any ideas about Viet Nam yet, but I will think it over. If anybody has a good script, pass it on to me. Iâ€™m famous but Iâ€™m very cheap. What is your first impression of Viet Nam? I have travelled quite a lot in the past few days. In Viet Nam, I keep travelling by car, but I just fall asleep because the trips are so tiring. I stole two books on Viet Nam from the hotel to learn about the culture. I love beautiful Vietnamese women, their traditional dress, the food and motorbikes, too. What is the difference between a comedic action star and a Goodwill Ambassador? Well, being a Goodwill Ambassador is more difficult. In films, if I do something wrong, I can do it again. Sometimes I write my own script, and if it is not good enough, I just edit the script and try the scene again. As a Goodwill Ambassador, I cannot make mistakes. Everything is new to me. Before assuming this role, I didnâ€™t fully understand the effects of war, HIV or landmines. Every conversation makes me cry. I just think about how I can help people. Itâ€™s a lot of pressure, but itâ€™s good pressure. Do you like doing charity work? Charity work makes me happy. Before, I just knew how to become famous and earn money. But my friends told me I should do something for other people. Then I started charity work, such as adopting children, building schools, and establishing the Jackie Chan Foundation (to provide annual scholarships to students in the performing and technical arts, to support youth projects, and to assist performing artists who have suffered hardships and injuries). I think anyone, rich or poor, can contribute something to charity. How did you teach your son these lessons? I didnâ€™t teach him anything. At first, he just wanted to spend money. I donâ€™t give him my money, but I let him earn his own. He is like me when I was 19, I just wanted to enjoy my life. But my son recently went to Thailand for three days to help tsunami victims.

UN calls on Viet Nam to continue combating HIV,"UNAIDS Viet Nam called on Viet Nam to invest wisely in its HIV response to ensure it achieves national and global targets on the occasion of the 25th World AIDS Day, which took place on Sunday.",[],2013-12-02,vietnamnews.vn,"UNAIDS Viet Nam called on Viet Nam to invest wisely in its HIV response to ensure it achieves national and global targets on the occasion of the 25th World AIDS Day, which took place on Sunday.â€” File Photo HA NOI (VNS) â€” UNAIDS Viet Nam called on Viet Nam to invest wisely in its HIV response to ensure it achieves national and global targets on the occasion of the 25th World AIDS Day, which took place on Sunday. ""Viet Nam has made great progress against HIV. But big challenges remain. It is critical for Viet Nam to focus precious national resources on three things: the right people, the right places and scaling up the most effective interventions,"" said Dr. Kristan Schoultz, Country Director of UNAIDS Viet Nam. ""The right people are key populations at higher risk of infection: people who inject drugs and their sexual partners, people who buy and sell sex and men who have sex with men. We need to reach out to these populations in high-burdened areas of the country with interventions that make the biggest difference: condoms, sterile injecting equipment, HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment,"" said Schoultz. Viet Nam has made significant strides in scaling up HIV treatment and reducing the rate of new HIV infections; as a result, the epidemic appears to be stabilising. However, high levels of HIV persist among key populations. In some cities, more than half of men who inject drugs were living with HIV by the end of 2012. The national rate for men having HIV among those who inject drugs was estimated at 11 per cent. National HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 2.7 per cent. Current evidence also indicates that HIV prevalence is increasing among men who have sex with men, a population that will account for an increasing proportion of future HIV infections. The epidemic was still prevalent in mountainous and remote areas, said Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and people living with HIV/AIDS continued to face significant discriminationâ€”making it harder for them to access health services. Decreasing support, both technical and financial, also presented an obstacle, Phuc added. As donor funding for HIV response declines, the United Nations was encouraging the country to expand initiatives that focus on earlier diagnosis and getting people on treatment as soon as possible in order to maximise the returns and impact of national investment. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also called on Viet Nam to make greater efforts to improve access to prevention, treatment, care and support services for key populations. This could be achieved through strengthening the partnership between the Ministry of Health and communities, promoting more proactive, simplified HIV testing and counseling strategies and maximising the treatment and prevention benefits of antiretroviral treatment. ""HIV response in Viet Nam is at a pivotal juncture. The scaling-up of innovative approaches is required to maintain momentum and build upon past achievements,"" said WHO Representative in Viet Nam Dr. Takeshi Kasai. ""We now know that HIV treatment can prevent transmission of HIV. By further supporting early access to HIV diagnosis and treatment, Viet Nam will be able to reduce new HIV infections and deaths caused by AIDS,"" added Kasai. Deputy Prime Minister Phuc said the Prime Minister had approved a project to ensure funding for HIV/AIDS control and prevention activities for the 2013-2020 period. A meeting with the theme ""Towards no more new HIV infected people"" was organised by the Viet Nam Red Cross Society in collaboration with the Viet Nam Youth Network on HIV/AIDS Prevention on Saturday in Ha Noi. Free consulting and HIV testing services were available alongside art and cultural performances and information aiming at preventing the disease and eliminating the stigma associated with it. â€” VNS",Society,"['response', 'men', 'combating', 'national', 'calls', 'nam', 'hiv', 'world', 'viet', 'continue', 'prevention', 'sex', 'treatment']","It is critical for Viet Nam to focus precious national resources on three things: the right people, the right places and scaling up the most effective interventions,"" said Dr. Kristan Schoultz, Country Director of UNAIDS Viet Nam.

Street kids overjoyed at free medical treatment,"Cu Ban said he was very happy to feel healthy again after being treated free of charge at the Xom Moi private clinic on Pham Van Chieu Street, Go Vap District in HCM City.",[],2009-06-08,vietnamnews.vn,"Street kids overjoyed at free medical treatment (09-06-2009) HCM CITY â€” Cu Ban said he was very happy to feel healthy again after being treated free of charge at the Xom Moi private clinic on Pham Van Chieu Street, Go Vap District in HCM City. The 12-year-old Ban said he had had a high fever and cough for weeks. The boy was too tired to sell lottery tickets on the street, his only source of income. Like many other street kids, Ban hesitated to come to the clinic, even though he had heard about it from his peers. ""I was afraid of being thrown out, so I didnâ€™t dare to come in. And I didnâ€™t have any money. If they asked me to pay for health care, I wouldnâ€™t have known what to do,"" Ban said. Ban has been living on the street since he was four years old and has done a number of odd jobs to survive: selling lottery tickets, shining shoes and even begging. He does not know who his parents are or where he was born. His family is the other street kids, who gather during meals and late at night in a constantly changing location from Go Vap to Tan Binh districts. He got his name, Ban, which means hives in Vietnamese, because of his year-round heat rash. But luckily things turned out differently than he expected. He was welcomed and given a medical examination and tablets free of charge. ""He needs a few days rest and will be fine,"" said doctor Nguyen Dang Phan. Pilot project Xom Moi, like the five other private clinics offering free checks-up, treatment and medicine for street kids, is part of the Centre of Health Education and Comm-unicationâ€™s pilot project to create friendly healthcare services for the cityâ€™s homeless children. After six months of operations, Mai Khoi private clinic on Tu Xuong Street, Xom Moi on Pham Van Chieu Street, Camillo on Le Van Si Street and Trieu Phuoc and Van Phuoc in District 11 have become familiar addresses with the cityâ€™s street kids. Truong Trong Hoang, a representative of the municipal Department of Healthâ€™s Centre for Health Education and Communication, said that homeless kids faced many health problems, especially reproductive problems and the risk of HIV/AIDS. ""The clinics not only take care of their health but also educate them about life skills to protect themselves from social evils and fatal diseases,"" Hoang said. There are an estimated 1,300 street kids in the city. ""These clinics maintain their operations by dividing the clinics into two parts: one for those who pay fees for medical examinations and the other for street children,"" said the centreâ€™s representative Hoang Thi Thu Loan. Modern equipment According to Loan, all the private clinics are equipped with modern medical equipment. The owner of the Van Phuoc and Trieu Phuoc private clinics, Ho Thi Trang, said that the eight doctors and eight nurses in her clinics received more than 20 children per month. Many are girls between 14 and 17 coming for an abortion. ""They know nothing about reproductive healthcare, and ask for abortions for pregnancies over two months old,"" Trang said. ""Most are panicked and worried because they can hardly feed themselves, not to mention a baby."" Doctor Phan said that his clinic reserved one room for kids infected with HIV/AIDS. ""They will be moved there and taken care of for the rest of their life when the disease becomes serious,"" Phan said. Trang said that children mostly heard about her clinic through word of mouth. ""We are willing to receive more kids and we want to do something useful for them. I know that many have to live in the streets and get diseases but do not know where to go for treatment,"" Trang said.",Society,"['medical', 'clinics', 'clinic', 'kids', 'phuoc', 'private', 'street', 'overjoyed', 'ban', 'free', 'van', 'treatment', 'health']","Street kids overjoyed at free medical treatment(09-06-2009)HCM CITY â€” Cu Ban said he was very happy to feel healthy again after being treated free of charge at the Xom Moi private clinic on Pham Van Chieu Street, Go Vap District in HCM City.
